in the ships on board of which they depart-ed â â Cruise in a Whale Boat â Sud-den-ly a mighty mass emerged from the water and shot up per-pen-dic-u-lar-ly in-to the air It was the whale â â Miri-am Cof-fin or the Whale Fish-er-man â The Whale is har-pooned to be sure but be-think you how you would man-age a pow-er-ful un-bro-ken colt with the mere ap-pli-ance of a rope tied to the root of his tail â â A Chap-ter on Whal-ing in Ribs and Trucks â On one oc-ca-sion I saw two of th-ese mon-sters whales prob-a-bly male and fe-male slow-ly swim-ming one after the other within less than a stoneâ s throw of the shoreâ Ter-ra Del Fuego â over which the beech tree ex-tend-ed its branch-es â â Dar-winâ s Voy-age of a Nat-u-ral-ist â â Stern all â ex-claimed the mate as upon turn-ing his head he saw the dis-tend-ed jaws of a large Sperm Whale close to the head of the boat threat-en-ing it with in-stant destruc-tion â â Stern all for your lives â â â Whar-ton the Whale Killer â So be cheery my lads let your hearts nev-er fail While the bold har-pooneer is strik-ing the whale â â Nan-tuck-et Song â Oh the rare old Whale mid storm and gale In his ocean home will be A giant in might where might is right And King of the bound-less sea â â Whale Song CHAPTER 1 Loom-ings Call me Ish-mael Some years agoâ nev-er mind how long pre-cise-lyâ hav-ing lit-tle or no money in my purse and noth-ing par-tic-u-lar to in-ter-est me on shore I thought I would sail about a lit-tle and see the watery part of the world It is a way I have of driv-ing off the spleen and reg-u-lat-ing the cir-cu-la-tion When-ev-er I find my-self grow-ing grim about the mouth when-ev-er it is a damp driz-zly Novem-ber in my soul when-ev-er I find my-self in-vol-un-tar-i-ly paus-ing be-fore cof-fin ware-hous-es and bring-ing up the rear of every funer-al I meet and espe-cial-ly when-ev-er my hy-pos get such an up-per hand of me that it re-quires a strong mo-ral prin-ci-ple to prevent me from de-lib-er-ate-ly step-ping in-to the street and me-thod-i-cal-ly knock-ing peo-pleâ s hats of-fâ then I ac-count it high time to get to sea as soon as I can This is my sub-sti-tute for pis-tol and ball With a philo-soph-i-cal flour-ish Ca-to throws him-self upon his sword I qui-et-ly take to the ship There is noth-ing sur-pris-ing in this If they but knew it al-most all men in their de-gree some time or other cher-ish very near-ly the same feel-ings towards the ocean with me There now is your in-su-lar ci-ty of the Man-hat-toes belt-ed round by wharves as In-di-an isles by co-ral reef-sâ com-merce sur-rounds it with her surf Right and left the streets take you water-ward Its ex-treme down-town is the bat-tery where that noble mole is washed by waves and cooled by breezes which a few hours pre-vi-ous were out of sight of land Look at the crowds of water gaz-ers there Cir-cum-am-bu-late the ci-ty of a dreamy Sab-bath after-noon Go from Cor-lears Hook to Coen-ties Slip and from thence by White-hall north-ward What do you see â Post-ed like si-lent sen-tinels all around the town stand thou-sands upon thou-sands of mor-tal men fixed in ocean rev-er-ies Some lean-ing against the spiles some seat-ed upon the pi-er heads some look-ing over the bul-warks of ships from Chi-na some high aloft in the rig-ging as if striv-ing to get a still bet-ter seaward peep But th-ese are all lands-men of week days pent up in lath and plasterâ tied to coun-ters nailed to bench-es clinched to desks How then is this Are the green fields gone What do they here But look here come more crowds pac-ing straight for the water and seem-ing-ly bound for a dive Strange Noth-ing will con-tent them but the ex-tremest lim-it of the land loi-ter-ing un-der the shady lee of yon-der ware-hous-es will not suf-fice No They must get just as nigh the water as they pos-si-bly can without falling in And there they standâ miles of themâ leagues In-lan-ders all they come from lanes and al-leys streets and av-enuesâ north east south and west Yet here they all unite Tell me does the mag-net-ic virtue of the nee-dles of the com-pass-es of all those ships at-tract them thith-er Once more Say you are in the coun-try in some high land of lakes Take al-most any path you please and ten to one it car-ries you down in a dale and leaves you there by a pool in the stream There is mag-ic in it Let the most ab-sent mind-ed of men be plunged in his deep-est rev-er-iesâ stand that man on his legs set his feet a go-ing and he will in-fal-li-bly lead you to water if water there be in all that re-gion Should you ever be athirst in the great Amer-i-can desert try this ex-per-i-ment if your car-a-van hap-pen to be sup-plied with a me-ta-phys-i-cal pro-fes-sor Yes as every one knows med-i-ta-tion and water are wed-ded for ever But here is an artist He de-sires to paint you the dreami-est shadi-est qui-etest most en-chant-ing bit of ro-man-tic land-scape in all the val-ley of the Sa-co What is the chief ele-ment he em-ploys There stand his trees each with a hol-low trunk as if a her-mit and a cru-ci-fix were within and here sleeps his mead-ow and there sleep his cat-tle and up from yon-der cot-tage goes a sleepy smoke Deep in-to dis-tant wood-lands winds a mazy way reach-ing to over-lap-ping spurs of moun-tains bathed in their hill side blue But though the pic-ture lies thus tranced and though this pine tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this shep-herdâ s head yet all were vain un-less the shep-herdâ s eye were fixed upon the mag-ic stream be-fore him Go visit the Prairies in June when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee deep among Tiger liliesâ what is the one charm want-ing â Waterâ there is not a drop of water there Were Ni-a-gara but a cataract of sand would you trav-el your thou-sand miles to see it Why did the poor poet of Ten-nessee upon sud-den-ly re-ceiv-ing two hand-fuls of sil-ver de-lib-er-ate whether to buy him a coat which he sad-ly need-ed or in-vest his money in a pedes-tri-an trip to Rock-away Beach Why is al-most every ro-bust healthy boy with a ro-bust healthy soul in him at some time or other crazy to go to sea Why upon your first voy-age as a pas-sen-ger did you your-self feel such a mys-ti-cal vi-bra-tion when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land Why did the old Per-sians hold the sea holy Why did the Greeks give it a separate de-ity and own brother of Jove Sure-ly all this is not without mean-ing And still deep-er the mean-ing of that sto-ry of Nar-cis-sus who be-cause he could not grasp the tor-ment-ing mild image he saw in the foun-tain plunged in-to it and was drowned But that same image we our-selves see in all rivers and oceans It is the image of the un-gras-pable phan-tom of life and this is the key to it all Now when I say that I am in the habit of go-ing to sea when-ev-er I be-gin to grow hazy about the eyes and be-gin to be over con-scious of my lungs I do not mean to have it in-ferred that I ever go to sea as a pas-sen-ger For to go as a pas-sen-ger you must needs have a purse and a purse is but a rag un-less you have some-thing in it Be-sides pas-sen-gers get sea sickâ grow quar-rel-someâ donâ t sleep of night-sâ do not en-joy them-selves much as a gen-er-al thing â no I nev-er go as a pas-sen-ger nor though I am some-thing of a salt do I ever go to sea as a Com-modore or a Cap-tain or a Cook I aban-don the glo-ry and distinc-tion of such of-fices to those who like them For my part I abom-i-nate all honor-able re-spectable toils tri-als and tribu-la-tions of every kind what-so-ev-er It is quite as much as I can do to take care of my-self without tak-ing care of ships bar-ques brigs schooners and what not And as for go-ing as cook â though I con-fess there is con-sid-er-able glo-ry in that a cook be-ing a sort of of-fi-cer on ship boardâ yet some-how I nev-er fan-cied broil-ing fowls â though once broiled ju-di-cious-ly but-tered and judg-mat-i-cal-ly salt-ed and pep-pered there is no one who will speak more re-spect-ful-ly not to say rev-er-en-tial-ly of a broiled fowl than I will It is out of the idola-trous dot-ings of the old Egyp-tians upon broiled ibis and roast-ed riv-er horse that you see the mum-mies of those crea-tures in their huge bake hous-es the pyra-mids No when I go to sea I go as a sim-ple sailor right be-fore the mast plumb down in-to the fore-cas-tle aloft there to the roy-al mast head True they rather order me about some and make me jump from spar to spar like a grasshop-per in a May mead-ow And at first this sort of thing is un-pleas-ant enough It touch-es oneâ s sense of honor par-tic-u-lar-ly if you come of an old estab-lished fam-i-ly in the land the Van Rens-se-laers or Ran-dolphs or Hardi-canutes And more than all if just pre-vi-ous to put-ting your hand in-to the tar pot you have been lord-ing it as a coun-try school-mas-ter mak-ing the tallest boys stand in awe of you The tran-si-tion is a keen one I as-sure you from a school-mas-ter to a sailor and re-quires a strong de-coc-tion of Seneca and the Sto-ics to en-able you to grin and bear it But even this wears off in time What of it if some old hunks of a sea cap-tain orders me to get a broom and sweep down the decks What does that indig-ni-ty amount to weighed I mean in the scales of the New Tes-ta-ment Do you think the ar-changel Gabriel thinks any-thing the less of me be-cause I prompt-ly and re-spect-ful-ly obey that old hunks in that par-tic-u-lar in-stance Who ainâ t a slave Tell me that Well then how-ev-er the old sea cap-tains may order me aboutâ how-ev-er they may thump and punch me about I have the sat-is-fac-tion of know-ing that it is all right that every-body else is one way or other served in much the same wayâ either in a phys-i-cal or me-ta-phys-i-cal point of view that is and so the univer-sal thump is passed round and all hands should rub each otherâ s shoul-der blades and be con-tent Again I al-ways go to sea as a sailor be-cause they make a point of pay-ing me for my trou-ble where-as they nev-er pay pas-sen-gers a sin-gle pen-ny that I ever heard of On the con-trary pas-sen-gers them-selves must pay And there is all the dif-fer-ence in the world between pay-ing and be-ing paid The act of pay-ing is per-haps the most un-com-fort-able in-flic-tion that the two or-chard thieves en-tailed upon us But be-ing paid â what will com-pare with it The ur-bane ac-tiv-i-ty with which a man re-ceives money is real-ly marvel-lous con-sid-er-ing that we so earnest-ly believe money to be the root of all earth-ly il-ls and that on no ac-count can a monied man en-ter heav-en Ah how cheer-ful-ly we con-sign our-selves to perdi-tion Fi-nal-ly I al-ways go to sea as a sailor be-cause of the whole-some ex-er-cise and pure air of the fore cas-tle deck For as in this world head winds are far more preva-lent than winds from astern that is if you nev-er vi-o-late the Pythagore-an max-im so for the most part the Com-modore on the quar-ter deck gets his at-mo-sphere at se-cond hand from the sailors on the fore-cas-tle He thinks he breathes it first but not so In much the same way do the com-mon-al-ty lead their lead-ers in many other things at the same time that the lead-ers lit-tle sus-pect it But where-fore it was that after hav-ing re-peat-ed-ly smelt the sea as a mer-chant sailor I should now take it in-to my head to go on a whal-ing voy-age this the in-vis-i-ble po-lice of-fi-cer of the Fates who has the con-stant surveil-lance of me and se-cret-ly dogs me and in-flu-ences me in some unac-count-able wayâ he can bet-ter an-swer than any one else And doubt-less my go-ing on this whal-ing voy-age formed part of the grand pro-gramme of Prov-i-dence that was drawn up a long time ago It came in as a sort of brief in-ter-lude and so-lo between more ex-ten-sive per-for-mances I take it that this part of the bill must have run some-thing like this â Grand Con-test-ed Elec-tion for the Pres-i-den-cy of the Unit-ed States â WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL â BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN â Though I can-not tell why it was ex-act-ly that those stage man-agers the Fates put me down for this shab-by part of a whal-ing voy-age when others were set down for mag-nif-i-cent parts in high tragedies and short and easy parts in gen-teel come-dies and jol-ly parts in farcesâ though I can-not tell why this was ex-act-ly yet now that I re-call all the cir-cum-stances I think I can see a lit-tle in-to the springs and mo-tives which be-ing cun-ning-ly pre-sent-ed to me un-der var-i-ous dis-guis-es in-duced me to set about per-form-ing the part I did be-sides ca-jol-ing me in-to the delu-sion that it was a choice re-sult-ing from my own un-bi-ased freewill and dis-crim-i-nat-ing judg-ment Chief among th-ese mo-tives was the over-whelm-ing idea of the great whale him-self Such a por-ten-tous and mys-te-ri-ous mon-ster roused all my cu-rios-i-ty Then the wild and dis-tant seas where he rolled his is-land bulk the un-de-liv-er-able name-less per-ils of the whale th-ese with all the at-tend-ing marvels of a thou-sand Patag-o-ni-an sights and sounds helped to sway me to my wish With other men per-haps such things would not have been in-duce-men-ts but as for me I am tor-ment-ed with an ever-last-ing itch for things re-mote I love to sail for-bid-den seas and land on bar-barous coasts Not ig-nor-ing what is good I am quick to per-ceive a hor-ror and could still be so-cial with itâ would they let meâ since it is but well to be on friend-ly ter-ms with all the in-mates of the place one lodges in By rea-son of th-ese things then the whal-ing voy-age was wel-come the great flood gates of the won-der world swung open and in the wild con-ceits that swayed me to my pur-pose two and two there float-ed in-to my in-most soul end-less pro-ces-sions of the whale and mid most of them all one grand hood-ed phan-tom like a snow hill in the air CHAPTER 2 The Car-pet Bag I stuffed a shirt or two in-to my old car-pet bag tucked it un-der my arm and start-ed for Cape Horn and the Pa-cif-ic Quit-ting the good ci-ty of old Man-hat-to I du-ly ar-rived in New Bed-ford It was a Satur-day night in De-cem-ber Much was I dis-ap-point-ed upon learn-ing that the lit-tle pack-et for Nan-tuck-et had al-ready sailed and that no way of reach-ing that place would of-fer till the fol-low-ing Mon-day As most young can-di-dates for the pains and penal-ties of whal-ing stop at this same New Bed-ford thence to em-bark on their voy-age it may as well be re-lat-ed that I for one had no idea of so do-ing For my mind was made up to sail in no other than a Nan-tuck-et craft be-cause there was a fine bois-ter-ous some-thing about every-thing con-nect-ed with that fa-mous old is-land which amaz-ing-ly pleased me Be-sides though New Bed-ford has of late been grad-u-al-ly mo-nop-o-lis-ing the busi-ness of whal-ing and though in this mat-ter poor old Nan-tuck-et is now much be-hind her yet Nan-tuck-et was her great orig-i-nalâ the Tyre of this Carthage â the place where the first dead Amer-i-can whale was strand-ed Where else but from Nan-tuck-et did those abo-rig-i-nal whale-men the Red Men first sal-ly out in ca-noes to give chase to the Le-viathan And where but from Nan-tuck-et too did that first ad-ven-tur-ous lit-tle sloop put forth part-ly laden with im-port-ed cob-ble-stonesâ so goes the sto-ryâ to throw at the whales in order to dis-cov-er when they were nigh enough to risk a har-poon from the bowsprit Now hav-ing a night a day and still another night fol-low-ing be-fore me in New Bed-ford ere I could em-bark for my destined port it be-came a mat-ter of con-cern-ment where I was to eat and sleep mean-while It was a very du-bi-ous look-ing nay a very dark and dis-mal night bit-ing-ly cold and cheer-less I knew no one in the place With anx-ious grap-nels I had sound-ed my pock-et and on-ly brought up a few pieces of sil-ver â So wher-ev-er you go Ish-mael said I to my-self as I stood in the mid-dle of a dreary street shoul-der-ing my bag and com-par-ing the gloom towards the north with the dark-ness towards the southâ wher-ev-er in your wis-dom you may con-clude to lodge for the night my dear Ish-mael be sure to in-quire the price and donâ t be too par-tic-u-lar With halt-ing steps I paced the streets and passed the sign of â The Crossed Har-poon-sâ â but it looked too ex-pen-sive and jol-ly there Fur-ther on from the bright red win-dows of the â Sword Fish Inn â there came such fer-vent rays that it seemed to have melt-ed the packed snow and ice from be-fore the house for every-where else the congealed frost lay ten inch-es thick in a hard asphaltic pave-ment â rather weary for me when I struck my foot against the flin-ty pro-jec-tions be-cause from hard re-morse-less ser-vice the soles of my boots were in a most mis-er-able plight Too ex-pen-sive and jol-ly again thought I paus-ing one mo-ment to watch the broad glare in the street and hear the sounds of the tin-kling glass-es within But go on Ish-mael said I at last donâ t you hear get away from be-fore the door your patched boots are stop-ping the way So on I went I now by in-stinct fol-lowed the streets that took me water-ward for there doubt-less were the cheapest if not the cheeri-est in-ns Such dreary streets blocks of black-ness not hous-es on either hand and here and there a can-dle like a can-dle mov-ing about in a tomb At this hour of the night of the last day of the week that quar-ter of the town proved all but de-sert-ed But present-ly I came to a smoky light pro-ceed-ing from a low wide build-ing the door of which stood invit-ing-ly open It had a care-less look as if it were meant for the us-es of the public so en-ter-ing the first thing I did was to stum-ble over an ash box in the porch Ha thought I ha as the fly-ing par-ti-cles al-most choked me are th-ese ash-es from that de-stroyed ci-ty Go-mor-rah But â The Crossed Har-poons â and â The Sword Fish â â this then must needs be the sign of â The Trap â How-ev-er I picked my-self up and hear-ing a loud voice within pushed on and opened a se-cond in-te-ri-or door It seemed the great Black Par-lia-ment sit-ting in Tophet A hun-dred black faces turned round in their rows to peer and beyond a black An-gel of Doom was beat-ing a book in a pul-pit It was a ne-gro church and the preacherâ s text was about the black-ness of dark-ness and the weep-ing and wail-ing and teeth gnash-ing there Ha Ish-mael mut-tered I back-ing out Wretched en-ter-tain-ment at the sign of â The Trap â Mov-ing on I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks and heard a for-lorn creak-ing in the air and look-ing up saw a swing-ing sign over the door with a white paint-ing upon it faint-ly rep-re-sent-ing a tall straight jet of misty spray and th-ese words un-derneathâ â The Spouter Inn â Peter Cof-fin â Cof-fin â Spouter â Rather omi-nous in that par-tic-u-lar con-nex-ion thought I But it is a com-mon name in Nan-tuck-et they say and I sup-pose this Peter here is an emi-grant from there As the light looked so dim and the place for the time looked qui-et enough and the di-lap-i-dat-ed lit-tle wood-en house it-self looked as if it might have been cart-ed here from the ruins of some burnt district and as the swing-ing sign had a pover-ty strick-en sort of creak to it I thought that here was the very spot for cheap lodg-ings and the best of pea cof-fee It was a queer sort of placeâ a gable end-ed old house one side palsied as it were and lean-ing over sad-ly It stood on a sharp bleak corner where that tem-pes-tu-ous wind Euro-clydon kept up a worse howl-ing than ever it did about poor Paulâ s tossed craft Euro-clydon nev-er-the-less is a mighty pleas-ant ze-phyr to any one in doors with his feet on the hob qui-et-ly toast-ing for bed â In judg-ing of that tem-pes-tu-ous wind called Euro-clydon â says an old writerâ of whose works I possess the on-ly copy ex-tan-tâ â it maketh a marvel-lous dif-fer-ence whether thou look-est out at it from a glass win-dow where the frost is all on the out-side or whether thou ob-ser-vest it from that sash-less win-dow where the frost is on both sides and of which the wight Death is the on-ly glazier â True enough thought I as this pas-sage oc-curred to my mindâ old black let-ter thou rea-son-est well Yes th-ese eyes are win-dows and this body of mine is the house What a pi-ty they did-nâ t stop up the chinks and the cran-nies though and thrust in a lit-tle lint here and there But itâ s too late to make any im-prove-men-ts now The uni-verse is fin-ished the cope-stone is on and the chips were cart-ed off a mil-lion years ago Poor Lazarus there chat-ter-ing his teeth against the curb-stone for his pil-low and shak-ing off his tat-ters with his shiver-ings he might plug up both ears with rags and put a corn cob in-to his mouth and yet that would not keep out the tem-pes-tu-ous Euro-clydon Euro-clydon says old Dives in his red silken wrap-perâ he had a red-der one after-wards pooh pooh What a fine frosty night how Ori-on glit-ters what north-ern lights Let them talk of their ori-en-tal sum-mer climes of ever-last-ing con-ser-va-to-ries give me the priv-i-lege of mak-ing my own sum-mer with my own coals But what thinks Lazarus Can he warm his blue hands by hold-ing them up to the grand north-ern lights Would not Lazarus rather be in Su-ma-tra than here Would he not far rather lay him down length-wise along the line of the equa-tor yea ye gods go down to the fiery pit it-self in order to keep out this frost Now that Lazarus should lie strand-ed there on the curb-stone be-fore the door of Dives this is more won-der-ful than that an ice-berg should be moored to one of the Moluc-cas Yet Dives him-self he too lives like a Czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs and be-ing a pres-i-dent of a tem-per-ance so-ci-ety he on-ly drinks the tepid tears of or-phans But no more of this blub-ber-ing now we are go-ing a whal-ing and there is plen-ty of that yet to come Let us scrape the ice from our frost-ed feet and see what sort of a place this â Spouterâ may be CHAPTER 3 The Spouter Inn En-ter-ing that gable end-ed Spouter Inn you found your-self in a wide low strag-gling en-try with old fash-ioned wain-scots re-mind-ing one of the bul-warks of some con-demned old craft On one side hung a very large oil-paint-ing so thor-ough-ly besmoked and every way de-faced that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it it was on-ly by dili-gent study and a series of sys-tem-at-ic visits to it and care-ful in-quiry of the neigh-bors that you could any way ar-rive at an un-der-stand-ing of its pur-pose Such unac-count-able mass-es of shades and shad-ows that at first you al-most thought some am-bi-tious young artist in the time of the New Eng-land hags had en-deav-ored to de-lin-eate chaos be-witched But by dint of much and earnest con-tem-pla-tion and oft re-peat-ed pon-der-ings and espe-cial-ly by throw-ing open the lit-tle win-dow towards the back of the en-try you at last come to the con-clu-sion that such an idea how-ev-er wild might not be al-to-geth-er un-war-rant-ed But what most puz-zled and con-found-ed you was a long lim-ber por-ten-tous black mass of some-thing hover-ing in the cen-tre of the pic-ture over three blue dim per-pen-dic-u-lar lines float-ing in a name-less yeast A bog-gy sog-gy squitchy pic-ture tru-ly enough to drive a ner-vous man dis-tract-ed Yet was there a sort of in-def-i-nite half at-tained un-imag-in-able sublim-i-ty about it that fair-ly froze you to it till you in-vol-un-tar-i-ly took an oath with your-self to find out what that marvel-lous paint-ing meant Ever and anon a bright but alas de-cep-tive idea would dart you through â Itâ s the Black Sea in a mid-night gale â Itâ s the un-nat-u-ral com-bat of the four pri-mal ele-men-ts â Itâ s a blast-ed heath â Itâ s a Hyper-bore-an win-ter scene â Itâ s the break-ing up of the ice-bound stream of Time But at last all th-ese fan-cies yield-ed to that one por-ten-tous some-thing in the pic-tureâ s midst That once found out and all the rest were plain But stop does it not bear a faint re-sem-blance to a gi-gan-tic fish even the great le-viathan him-self In fact the artistâ s de-sign seemed this a fi-nal the-o-ry of my own part-ly based upon the ag-gre-gat-ed opin-ions of many aged per-sons with whom I con-versed upon the sub-ject The pic-ture rep-re-sen-ts a Cape Horner in a great hur-ri-cane the half foundered ship wel-ter-ing there with its three dis-man-tled masts alone vis-i-ble and an ex-as-per-at-ed whale pur-pos-ing to spring clean over the craft is in the enor-mous act of im-pal-ing him-self upon the three mast heads The op-po-site wall of this en-try was hung all over with a hea-then-ish ar-ray of mon-strous clubs and spears Some were thick-ly set with glit-ter-ing teeth re-sem-bling ivory saws others were tuft-ed with knots of hu-man hair and one was sick-le shaped with a vast han-dle sweep-ing round like the seg-ment made in the new mown grass by a long armed mow-er You shud-dered as you gazed and won-dered what mon-strous can-ni-bal and sav-age could ever have gone a death har-vest-ing with such a hack-ing hor-ri-fy-ing im-ple-ment Mixed with th-ese were rusty old whal-ing lances and har-poons all bro-ken and de-formed Some were sto-ried weapons With this once long lance now wild-ly el-bowed fifty years ago did Nathan Swain kill fif-teen whales between a sun-rise and a sun-set And that har-poonâ so like a corkscrew nowâ was flung in Ja-van seas and run away with by a whale years after-wards slain off the Cape of Blan-co The orig-i-nal iron en-tered nigh the tail and like a rest-less nee-dle so-journ-ing in the body of a man trav-elled full forty feet and at last was found imbed-ded in the hump Cross-ing this dusky en-try and on through yon low arched wayâ cut through what in old times must have been a great cen-tral chim-ney with fire-places all roundâ you en-ter the public room A still duski-er place is this with such low pon-der-ous beams above and such old wrin-kled planks be-neath that you would al-most fan-cy you trod some old craftâ s cock-pits espe-cial-ly of such a howl-ing night when this corner an-chored old ark rocked so fu-ri-ous-ly On one side stood a long low shelf like table covered with cracked glass cas-es filled with dusty rar-i-ties gathered from this wide worldâ s re-motest nooks Pro-ject-ing from the fur-ther an-gle of the room stands a dark look-ing denâ the barâ a rude at-tempt at a right whaleâ s head Be that how it may there stands the vast arched bone of the whaleâ s jaw so wide a coach might al-most drive be-neath it Within are shab-by shelves ranged round with old de-can-ters bot-tles flasks and in those jaws of swift destruc-tion like another cursed Jon-ah by which name in-deed they called him bus-tles a lit-tle withered old man who for their money dear-ly sel-ls the sailors delir-i-ums and death Abom-inable are the tum-blers in-to which he pours his poi-son Though true cylin-ders withoutâ within the vil-lanous green gog-gling glass-es de-ceit-ful-ly tapered down-wards to a cheat-ing bot-tom Par-al-lel merid-i-ans rude-ly pecked in-to the glass sur-round th-ese foot-pad-sâ goblets Fill to this mark and your charge is but a pen-ny to this a pen-ny more and so on to the full glassâ the Cape Horn mea-sure which you may gulp down for a shilling Upon en-ter-ing the place I found a num-ber of young sea-men gathered about a table ex-am-in-ing by a dim light divers spec-i-mens of skrimshan-der I sought the land-lord and telling him I de-sired to be ac-com-mo-dat-ed with a room re-ceived for an-swer that his house was ful-lâ not a bed unoc-cu-pied â But avast â he added tap-ping his fore-head â you haint no ob-jec-tions to shar-ing a har-pooneerâ s blan-ket have ye I sâ pose you are goinâ a whal-inâ so youâ d bet-ter get used to that sort of thing â I told him that I nev-er liked to sleep two in a bed that if I should ever do so it would depend upon who the har-pooneer might be and that if he the land-lord real-ly had no other place for me and the har-pooneer was not de-cid-ed-ly ob-jec-tion-able why rather than wan-der fur-ther about a strange town on so bit-ter a night I would put up with the half of any de-cent manâ s blan-ket â I thought so All right take a seat Sup-per â you want sup-per Sup-perâ ll be ready direct-ly â I sat down on an old wood-en set-tle carved all over like a bench on the Bat-tery At one end a ru-mi-nat-ing tar was still fur-ther adorn-ing it with his jack knife stoop-ing over and dili-gent-ly work-ing away at the space between his legs He was try-ing his hand at a ship un-der full sail but he did-nâ t make much head-way I thought At last some four or five of us were sum-moned to our meal in an ad-join-ing room It was cold as Ice-landâ no fire at al-lâ the land-lord said he could-nâ t af-ford it Noth-ing but two dis-mal tal-low can-dles each in a wind-ing sheet We were fain to but-ton up our mon-key jack-ets and hold to our lips cups of scald-ing tea with our half frozen fingers But the fare was of the most sub-stan-tial kindâ not on-ly meat and po-ta-toes but dumplings good heav-ens dumplings for sup-per One young fel-low in a green box coat ad-dressed him-self to th-ese dumplings in a most dire-ful man-ner â My boy â said the land-lord â youâ ll have the night-mare to a dead sar-tain-ty â â Land-lord â I whis-pered â that aint the har-pooneer is it â â Oh no â said he look-ing a sort of di-abol-i-cal-ly fun-ny â the har-pooneer is a dark com-plex-ioned chap He nev-er eats dumplings he donâ tâ he eats noth-ing but steaks and he likes â em rare â â The devil he does â says I â Where is that har-pooneer Is he here â â Heâ ll be here afore long â was the an-swer I could not help it but I be-gan to feel sus-pi-cious of this â dark com-plex-ionedâ har-pooneer At any rate I made up my mind that if it so turned out that we should sleep to-geth-er he must un-dress and get in-to bed be-fore I did Sup-per over the com-pa-ny went back to the bar room when know-ing not what else to do with my-self I re-solved to spend the rest of the even-ing as a look-er on Present-ly a ri-ot-ing noise was heard without Start-ing up the land-lord cried â Thatâ s the Gram-pusâ s crew I seed her re-port-ed in the off-ing this morn-ing a three yearsâ voy-age and a full ship Hur-rah boys now weâ ll have the lat-est news from the Feegees â A tramp-ing of sea boots was heard in the en-try the door was flung open and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough En-veloped in their shag-gy watch coats and with their heads muf-fled in woollen com-forters all bedarned and ragged and their beards stiff with ici-cles they seemed an erup-tion of bears from Labrador They had just land-ed from their boat and this was the first house they en-tered No won-der then that they made a straight wake for the whaleâ s mouthâ the barâ when the wrin-kled lit-tle old Jon-ah there of-fi-ci-at-ing soon poured them out brim-mers all round One com-plained of a bad cold in his head upon which Jon-ah mixed him a pitch like po-tion of gin and mo-lasses which he swore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catar-rhs what-so-ev-er nev-er mind of how long stand-ing or whether caught off the coast of Labrador or on the weather side of an ice is-land The liquor soon mount-ed in-to their heads as it gen-er-al-ly does even with the ar-ran-test top-ers new-ly land-ed from sea and they be-gan caper-ing about most ob-streper-ous-ly I ob-served how-ev-er that one of them held some-what aloof and though he seemed de-sirous not to spoil the hi-lar-i-ty of his ship-mates by his own sober face yet upon the whole he re-frained from mak-ing as much noise as the rest This man in-ter-est-ed me at once and since the sea gods had or-dained that he should soon be-come my ship-mate though but a sleep-ing part-ner one so far as this nar-ra-tive is con-cerned I will here ven-ture upon a lit-tle de-scrip-tion of him He stood full six feet in height with noble shoul-ders and a ch-est like a cof-fer dam I have sel-dom seen such brawn in a man His face was deeply brown and burnt mak-ing his white teeth daz-zling by the con-trast while in the deep shad-ows of his eyes float-ed some rem-i-nis-cences that did not seem to give him much joy His voice at once an-nounced that he was a South-ern-er and from his fine stature I thought he must be one of those tall moun-taineers from the Al-legha-ni-an Ridge in Vir-ginia When the revel-ry of his com-pan-ions had mount-ed to its height this man slipped away unob-served and I saw no more of him till he be-came my com-rade on the sea In a few min-utes how-ev-er he was missed by his ship-mates and be-ing it seems for some rea-son a huge favourite with them they raised a cry of â Bulk-ing-ton Bulk-ing-ton whereâ s Bulk-ing-ton â and dart-ed out of the house in pur-suit of him It was now about nine oâ clock and the room seem-ing al-most su-per-nat-u-ral-ly qui-et after th-ese or-gies I be-gan to con-grat-u-late my-self upon a lit-tle plan that had oc-curred to me just pre-vi-ous to the en-trance of the sea-men No man prefers to sleep two in a bed In fact you would a good deal rather not sleep with your own brother I donâ t know how it is but peo-ple like to be pri-vate when they are sleep-ing And when it comes to sleep-ing with an un-known stranger in a strange inn in a strange town and that stranger a har-pooneer then your ob-jec-tions in-def-i-nite-ly mul-ti-ply Nor was there any earth-ly rea-son why I as a sailor should sleep two in a bed more than any-body else for sailors no more sleep two in a bed at sea than bach-e-lor Kings do ashore To be sure they all sleep to-geth-er in one apart-ment but you have your own ham-mock and cover your-self with your own blan-ket and sleep in your own skin The more I pon-dered over this har-pooneer the more I abom-i-nat-ed the thought of sleep-ing with him It was fair to pre-sume that be-ing a har-pooneer his li-nen or woollen as the case might be would not be of the ti-di-est cer-tain-ly none of the finest I be-gan to twitch all over Be-sides it was get-ting late and my de-cent har-pooneer ought to be home and go-ing bed-wards Sup-pose now he should tum-ble in upon me at mid-nightâ how could I tell from what vile hole he had been com-ing â Land-lord Iâ ve changed my mind about that har-pooneer â I shanâ t sleep with him Iâ ll try the bench here â â Just as you please Iâ m sor-ry I canâ t spare ye a table-cloth for a mat-tress and itâ s a plaguy rough board hereâ â feel-ing of the knots and notch-es â But wait a bit Skrimshan-der Iâ ve got a car-pen-terâ s plane there in the barâ wait I say and Iâ ll make ye snug enough â So say-ing he pro-cured the plane and with his old silk hand-ker-chief first dust-ing the bench vig-or-ous-ly set to plan-ing away at my bed the while grin-ning like an ape The shav-ings flew right and left till at last the plane iron came bump against an in-de-struc-tible knot The land-lord was near sprain-ing his wrist and I told him for heav-enâ s sake to quitâ the bed was soft enough to suit me and I did not know how all the plan-ing in the world could make eider down of a pine plank So gather-ing up the shav-ings with another grin and throw-ing them in-to the great stove in the mid-dle of the room he went about his busi-ness and left me in a brown study I now took the mea-sure of the bench and found that it was a foot too short but that could be mend-ed with a chair But it was a foot too nar-row and the other bench in the room was about four inch-es higher than the planed oneâ so there was no yok-ing them I then placed the first bench length-wise along the on-ly clear space against the wall leav-ing a lit-tle in-ter-val between for my back to set-tle down in But I soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from un-der the sill of the win-dow that this plan would nev-er do at all espe-cial-ly as another cur-rent from the rick-ety door met the one from the win-dow and both to-geth-er formed a series of small whirl-winds in the im-me-di-ate vicin-i-ty of the spot where I had thought to spend the night The devil fetch that har-pooneer thought I but stop could-nâ t I steal a march on himâ bolt his door in-side and jump in-to his bed not to be wak-ened by the most vi-o-lent knock-ings It seemed no bad idea but upon se-cond thoughts I dis-missed it For who could tell but what the next morn-ing so soon as I popped out of the room the har-pooneer might be stand-ing in the en-try all ready to knock me down Still look-ing round me again and see-ing no pos-si-ble chance of spend-ing a suf-fer-able night un-less in some other per-sonâ s bed I be-gan to think that after all I might be cher-ish-ing un-war-rantable prej-u-dices against this un-known har-pooneer Thinks I Iâ ll wait awhile he must be drop-ping in be-fore long Iâ ll have a good look at him then and per-haps we may be-come jol-ly good bed-fel-lows after al-lâ thereâ s no telling But though the other board-ers kept com-ing in by ones twos and threes and go-ing to bed yet no sign of my har-pooneer â Land-lord â said I â what sort of a chap is heâ does he al-ways keep such late hours â It was now hard upon twelve oâ clock The land-lord chuck-led again with his lean chuck-le and seemed to be might-i-ly tick-led at some-thing beyond my com-pre-hen-sion â No â he an-swered â gen-er-al-ly heâ s an ear-ly birdâ air-ley to bed and air-ley to riseâ yes heâ s the bird what catch-es the worm But to night he went out a ped-dling you see and I donâ t see what on airth keeps him so late un-less may be he canâ t sell his head â â Canâ t sell his head â What sort of a bam-booz-ing-ly sto-ry is this you are telling me â get-ting in-to a tow-er-ing rage â Do you pre-tend to say land-lord that this har-pooneer is ac-tu-al-ly en-gaged this blessed Satur-day night or rather Sun-day morn-ing in ped-dling his head around this town â â Thatâ s pre-cise-ly it â said the land-lord â and I told him he could-nâ t sell it here the mar-ketâ s over-stocked â â With what â shout-ed I â With heads to be sure ainâ t there too many heads in the world â â I tell you what it is land-lord â said I quite calm-ly â youâ d bet-ter stop spin-ning that yarn to meâ Iâ m not green â â May be not â tak-ing out a stick and whit-tling a tooth-pick â but I rayther guess youâ ll be done brown if that ere har-pooneer hears you a slan-der-inâ his head â â Iâ ll break it for him â said I now fly-ing in-to a pas-sion again at this unac-count-able far-ra-go of the land-lordâ s â Itâ s broke aâ ready â said he â Broke â said Iâ â broke do you mean â â Sar-tain and thatâ s the very rea-son he canâ t sell it I guess â â Land-lord â said I go-ing up to him as cool as Mt He-cla in a snow stor-mâ â land-lord stop whit-tling You and I must un-der-stand one another and that too without de-lay I come to your house and want a bed you tell me you can on-ly give me half a one that the other half be-longs to a cer-tain har-pooneer And about this har-pooneer whom I have not yet seen you per-sist in telling me the most mys-ti-fy-ing and ex-as-per-at-ing sto-ries tend-ing to beget in me an un-com-fort-able feel-ing towards the man whom you de-sign for my bed-fel-lowâ a sort of con-nex-ion land-lord which is an in-ti-mate and con-fi-den-tial one in the high-est de-gree I now de-mand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this har-pooneer is and whether I shall be in all re-spec-ts safe to spend the night with him And in the first place you will be so good as to un-say that sto-ry about selling his head which if true I take to be good ev-i-dence that this har-pooneer is stark mad and Iâ ve no idea of sleep-ing with a mad-man and you sir you I mean land-lord you sir by try-ing to in-duce me to do so know-ing-ly would there-by ren-der your-self li-able to a crim-i-nal prose-cu-tion â â Wall â said the land-lord fetch-ing a long breath â thatâ s a pur-ty long sar-mon for a chap that rips a lit-tle now and then But be easy be easy this here har-pooneer I have been tellinâ you of has just ar-rived from the south seas where he bought up a lot of â balmed New Zealand heads great cu-rios you know and heâ s sold all on â em but one and that one heâ s try-ing to sell to night cause to mor-rowâ s Sun-day and it would not do to be sellinâ hu-man heads about the streets when folks is goinâ to church-es He want-ed to last Sun-day but I stopped him just as he was goinâ out of the door with four heads strung on a string for all the airth like a string of inions â This ac-count cleared up the other-wise unac-count-able mys-tery and showed that the land-lord after all had had no idea of fool-ing meâ but at the same time what could I think of a har-pooneer who stayed out of a Satur-day night clean in-to the holy Sab-bath en-gaged in such a can-ni-bal busi-ness as selling the heads of dead idola-tors â Depend upon it land-lord that har-pooneer is a danger-ous man â â He pays regâ lar â was the re-join-der â But come itâ s get-ting dread-ful late you had bet-ter be turn-ing flukesâ itâ s a nice bed Sal and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced Thereâ s plen-ty of room for two to kick about in that bed itâ s an almighty big bed that Why afore we give it up Sal used to put our Sam and lit-tle John-ny in the foot of it But I got a dream-ing and sprawl-ing about one night and some-how Sam got pitched on the floor and came near break-ing his arm Arter that Sal said it would-nâ t do Come along here Iâ ll give ye a glim in a jiffy â and so say-ing he light-ed a can-dle and held it towards me of-fer-ing to lead the way But I stood ir-res-o-lute when look-ing at a clock in the corner he ex-claimed â I vum itâ s Sun-dayâ you wonâ t see that har-pooneer to night heâ s come to an-chor some-whereâ come along then do come wonâ t ye come â I con-sid-ered the mat-ter a mo-ment and then up stairs we went and I was ush-ered in-to a small room cold as a clam and fur-nished sure enough with a prodi-gious bed al-most big enough in-deed for any four har-pooneers to sleep abreast â There â said the land-lord plac-ing the can-dle on a crazy old sea ch-est that did dou-ble du-ty as a wash stand and cen-tre table â there make your-self com-fort-able now and good night to ye â I turned round from eye-ing the bed but he had dis-ap-peared Fold-ing back the coun-ter-pane I stooped over the bed Though none of the most ele-gant it yet stood the scruti-ny tol-er-a-bly well I then glanced round the room and be-sides the bed-stead and cen-tre table could see no other fur-ni-ture be-long-ing to the place but a rude shelf the four wal-ls and a papered fire-board rep-re-sent-ing a man strik-ing a whale Of things not prop-er-ly be-long-ing to the room there was a ham-mock lashed up and thrown upon the floor in one corner al-so a large sea-manâ s bag con-tain-ing the har-pooneerâ s wardrobe no doubt in lieu of a land trunk Like-wise there was a par-cel of out-landish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the fire place and a tall har-poon stand-ing at the head of the bed But what is this on the ch-est I took it up and held it close to the light and felt it and smelt it and tried every way pos-si-ble to ar-rive at some sat-is-fac-to-ry con-clu-sion con-cern-ing it I can com-pare it to noth-ing but a large door mat or-na-ment-ed at the edges with lit-tle tin-kling tags some-thing like the stained por-cu-pine quil-ls round an In-di-an moc-casin There was a hole or slit in the mid-dle of this mat as you see the same in South Amer-i-can pon-chos But could it be pos-si-ble that any sober har-pooneer would get in-to a door mat and pa-rade the streets of any Chris-tian town in that sort of guise I put it on to try it and it weighed me down like a ham-per be-ing un-com-mon-ly shag-gy and thick and I thought a lit-tle damp as though this mys-te-ri-ous har-pooneer had been wear-ing it of a rainy day I went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall and I nev-er saw such a sight in my life I tore my-self out of it in such a hur-ry that I gave my-self a kink in the neck I sat down on the side of the bed and com-menced think-ing about this head ped-dling har-pooneer and his door mat After think-ing some time on the bed side I got up and took off my mon-key jack-et and then stood in the mid-dle of the room think-ing I then took off my coat and thought a lit-tle more in my shirt sleeves But begin-ning to feel very cold now half un-dressed as I was and re-mem-ber-ing what the land-lord said about the har-pooneerâ s not com-ing home at all that night it be-ing so very late I made no more ado but jumped out of my pan-taloons and boots and then blow-ing out the light tum-bled in-to bed and com-mend-ed my-self to the care of heav-en Whether that mat-tress was stuffed with corn cobs or bro-ken crock-ery there is no telling but I rolled about a good deal and could not sleep for a long time At last I slid off in-to a light doze and had pret-ty near-ly made a good off-ing towards the land of Nod when I heard a heavy foot-fall in the pas-sage and saw a glim-mer of light come in-to the room from un-der the door Lord save me thinks I that must be the har-pooneer the in-fer-nal head ped-dler But I lay per-fect-ly still and re-solved not to say a word till spo-ken to Hold-ing a light in one hand and that iden-ti-cal New Zealand head in the other the stranger en-tered the room and without look-ing towards the bed placed his can-dle a good way off from me on the floor in one corner and then be-gan work-ing away at the knot-ted cords of the large bag I be-fore spoke of as be-ing in the room I was all eager-ness to see his face but he kept it avert-ed for some time while em-ployed in un-lac-ing the bagâ s mouth This ac-com-plished how-ev-er he turned roundâ when good heav-ens what a sight Such a face It was of a dark pur-plish yel-low colour here and there stuck over with large black-ish look-ing squares Yes itâ s just as I thought heâ s a ter-ri-ble bed-fel-low heâ s been in a fight got dread-ful-ly cut and here he is just from the sur-geon But at that mo-ment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light that I plain-ly saw they could not be stick-ing plasters at all those black squares on his cheeks They were stains of some sort or other At first I knew not what to make of this but soon an in-kling of the truth oc-curred to me I re-mem-bered a sto-ry of a white manâ a whale-man tooâ who falling among the can-ni-bals had been tat-tooed by them I con-clud-ed that this har-pooneer in the course of his dis-tant voy-ages must have met with a sim-i-lar ad-ven-ture And what is it thought I after all Itâ s on-ly his out-side a man can be hon-est in any sort of skin But then what to make of his un-earth-ly com-plex-ion that part of it I mean ly-ing round about and com-plete-ly in-de-pen-dent of the squares of tat-too-ing To be sure it might be noth-ing but a good coat of trop-i-cal tan-ning but I nev-er heard of a hot sunâ s tan-ning a white man in-to a pur-plish yel-low one How-ev-er I had nev-er been in the South Seas and per-haps the sun there pro-duced th-ese ex-traor-di-nary ef-fec-ts upon the skin Now while all th-ese ideas were pass-ing through me like light-ning this har-pooneer nev-er no-ticed me at all But after some dif-fi-cul-ty hav-ing opened his bag he com-menced fum-bling in it and present-ly pulled out a sort of tom-a-hawk and a seal skin wal-let with the hair on Plac-ing th-ese on the old ch-est in the mid-dle of the room he then took the New Zealand headâ a ghast-ly thing enoughâ and crammed it down in-to the bag He now took off his hatâ a new beaver hatâ when I came nigh sing-ing out with fresh sur-prise There was no hair on his headâ none to speak of at leastâ noth-ing but a small scalp knot twist-ed up on his fore-head His bald pur-plish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull Had not the stranger stood between me and the door I would have bolt-ed out of it quick-er than ever I bolt-ed a din-ner Even as it was I thought some-thing of slip-ping out of the win-dow but it was the se-cond floor back I am no coward but what to make of this head ped-dling pur-ple ras-cal al-to-geth-er passed my com-pre-hen-sion Ig-no-rance is the par-ent of fear and be-ing com-plete-ly non-plussed and con-found-ed about the stranger I con-fess I was now as much afraid of him as if it was the devil him-self who had thus bro-ken in-to my room at the dead of night In fact I was so afraid of him that I was not game enough just then to ad-dress him and de-mand a sat-is-fac-to-ry an-swer con-cern-ing what seemed in-ex-pli-ca-ble in him Mean-while he con-tin-ued the busi-ness of un-dress-ing and at last showed his ch-est and ar-ms As I live th-ese covered parts of him were check-ered with the same squares as his face his back too was all over the same dark squares he seemed to have been in a Thir-ty Yearsâ War and just es-caped from it with a stick-ing plaster shirt Still more his very legs were marked as if a par-cel of dark green frogs were run-ning up the trunks of young palms It was now quite plain that he must be some abom-inable sav-age or other shipped aboard of a whale-man in the South Seas and so land-ed in this Chris-tian coun-try I quaked to think of it A ped-dler of heads tooâ per-haps the heads of his own brothers He might take a fan-cy to mineâ heav-ens look at that tom-a-hawk But there was no time for shud-der-ing for now the sav-age went about some-thing that com-plete-ly fas-ci-nat-ed my at-ten-tion and con-vinced me that he must in-deed be a hea-then Go-ing to his heavy grego or wra-pall or dread-naught which he had pre-vi-ous-ly hung on a chair he fum-bled in the pock-ets and pro-duced at length a cu-ri-ous lit-tle de-formed image with a hunch on its back and ex-act-ly the colour of a three daysâ old Con-go ba-by Re-mem-ber-ing the em-balmed head at first I al-most thought that this black manikin was a real ba-by pre-served in some sim-i-lar man-ner But see-ing that it was not at all lim-ber and that it glis-tened a good deal like pol-ished ebony I con-clud-ed that it must be noth-ing but a wood-en idol which in-deed it proved to be For now the sav-age goes up to the emp-ty fire place and re-mov-ing the papered fire board sets up this lit-tle hunch backed image like a ten-pin between the andirons The chim-ney jam-bs and all the bricks in-side were very sooty so that I thought this fire place made a very ap-pro-pri-ate lit-tle shrine or chapel for his Con-go idol I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hid-den image feel-ing but ill at ease mean-timeâ to see what was next to fol-low First he takes about a dou-ble hand-ful of shav-ings out of his grego pock-et and places them care-ful-ly be-fore the idol then lay-ing a bit of ship bis-cuit on top and ap-ply-ing the flame from the lamp he kin-dled the shav-ings in-to a sacri-fi-cial blaze Present-ly after many hasty snatch-es in-to the fire and still hasti-er with-drawals of his fingers where-by he seemed to be scorch-ing them bad-ly he at last suc-ceed-ed in draw-ing out the bis-cuit then blow-ing off the heat and ash-es a lit-tle he made a po-lite of-fer of it to the lit-tle ne-gro But the lit-tle devil did not seem to fan-cy such dry sort of fare at all he nev-er moved his lips All th-ese strange an-tics were ac-com-pa-nied by still stranger gut-tural nois-es from the devo-tee who seemed to be pray-ing in a sing song or else sing-ing some pa-gan psalmody or other dur-ing which his face twitched about in the most un-nat-u-ral man-ner At last ex-tin-guish-ing the fire he took the idol up very uncer-e-mo-ni-ous-ly and bagged it again in his grego pock-et as care-less-ly as if he were a sports-man bag-ging a dead wood-cock All th-ese queer pro-ceed-ings in-creased my un-com-fort-able-ness and see-ing him now ex-hibit-ing strong symp-toms of con-clud-ing his busi-ness oper-a-tions and jump-ing in-to bed with me I thought it was high time now or nev-er be-fore the light was put out to break the spell in which I had so long been bound But the in-ter-val I spent in de-lib-er-at-ing what to say was a fatal one Tak-ing up his tom-a-hawk from the table he ex-am-ined the head of it for an in-stant and then hold-ing it to the light with his mouth at the han-dle he puffed out great clouds of tobac-co smoke The next mo-ment the light was ex-tin-guished and this wild can-ni-bal tom-a-hawk between his teeth sprang in-to bed with me I sang out I could not help it now and giv-ing a sud-den grunt of as-ton-ish-ment he be-gan feel-ing me Stam-mer-ing out some-thing I knew not what I rolled away from him against the wall and then con-jured him who-ev-er or what-ev-er he might be to keep qui-et and let me get up and light the lamp again But his gut-tural re-spons-es sat-is-fied me at once that he but ill com-pre-hend-ed my mean-ing â Who e debel you â â he at last saidâ â you no speak e dam me I kill e â And so say-ing the light-ed tom-a-hawk be-gan flour-ish-ing about me in the dark â Land-lord for Godâ s sake Peter Cof-fin â shout-ed I â Land-lord Watch Cof-fin An-gels save me â â Speak e tell ee me who ee be or dam me I kill e â again growled the can-ni-bal while his hor-rid flour-ish-ings of the tom-a-hawk scat-tered the hot tobac-co ash-es about me till I thought my li-nen would get on fire But thank heav-en at that mo-ment the land-lord came in-to the room light in hand and leap-ing from the bed I ran up to him â Donâ t be afraid now â said he grin-ning again â Quee-queg here would-nâ t harm a hair of your head â â Stop your grin-ning â shout-ed I â and why did-nâ t you tell me that that in-fer-nal har-pooneer was a can-ni-bal â â I thought ye knowâ d it â did-nâ t I tell ye he was a ped-dlinâ heads around town â but turn flukes again and go to sleep Quee-queg look hereâ you sabbee me I sabbeeâ you this man sleepe youâ you sabbee â â Me sabbee plen-tyâ â grunt-ed Quee-queg puff-ing away at his pipe and sit-ting up in bed â You get-tee in â he added mo-tion-ing to me with his tom-a-hawk and throw-ing the clothes to one side He real-ly did this in not on-ly a civ-il but a real-ly kind and char-i-ta-ble way I stood look-ing at him a mo-ment For all his tat-too-ings he was on the whole a clean come-ly look-ing can-ni-bal Whatâ s all this fuss I have been mak-ing about thought I to my-selfâ the manâ s a hu-man be-ing just as I am he has just as much rea-son to fear me as I have to be afraid of him Bet-ter sleep with a sober can-ni-bal than a drunk-en Chris-tian â Land-lord â said I â tell him to stash his tom-a-hawk there or pipe or what-ev-er you call it tell him to stop smok-ing in short and I will turn in with him But I donâ t fan-cy hav-ing a man smok-ing in bed with me Itâ s danger-ous Be-sides I ainâ t in-sured â This be-ing told to Quee-queg he at once com-plied and again po-lite-ly mo-tioned me to get in-to bedâ rolling over to one side as much as to sayâ â I wonâ t touch a leg of ye â â Good night land-lord â said I â you may go â I turned in and nev-er slept bet-ter in my life CHAPTER 4 The Coun-ter-pane Upon wak-ing next morn-ing about day-light I found Quee-quegâ s arm thrown over me in the most lov-ing and af-fec-tion-ate man-ner You had al-most thought I had been his wife The coun-ter-pane was of patch-work full of odd lit-tle par-ti coloured squares and tri-an-gles and this arm of his tat-tooed all over with an in-ter-minable Cre-tan labyrinth of a fig-ure no two parts of which were of one pre-cise shadeâ owing I sup-pose to his keep-ing his arm at sea un-me-thod-i-cal-ly in sun and shade his shirt sleeves ir-reg-u-lar-ly rolled up at var-i-ous timesâ this same arm of his I say looked for all the world like a strip of that same patch-work quilt In-deed part-ly ly-ing on it as the arm did when I first awoke I could hard-ly tell it from the quilt they so blend-ed their hues to-geth-er and it was on-ly by the sense of weight and pres-sure that I could tell that Quee-queg was hug-ging me My sen-sa-tions were strange Let me try to ex-plain them When I was a child I well re-mem-ber a some-what sim-i-lar cir-cum-stance that be-fell me whether it was a real-i-ty or a dream I nev-er could en-tire-ly set-tle The cir-cum-stance was this I had been cut-ting up some caper or otherâ I think it was try-ing to crawl up the chim-ney as I had seen a lit-tle sweep do a few days pre-vi-ous and my step-moth-er who some-how or other was all the time whip-ping me or send-ing me to bed sup-per-less â my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chim-ney and packed me off to bed though it was on-ly two oâ clock in the after-noon of the 21st June the longest day in the year in our hemi-sphere I felt dread-ful-ly But there was no help for it so up stairs I went to my lit-tle room in the third floor un-dressed my-self as slow-ly as pos-si-ble so as to kill time and with a bit-ter sigh got between the sheets I lay there dis-mal-ly cal-cu-lat-ing that six-teen en-tire hours must elapse be-fore I could hope for a res-ur-rec-tion Six-teen hours in bed the small of my back ached to think of it And it was so light too the sun shin-ing in at the win-dow and a great rat-tling of coach-es in the streets and the sound of gay voic-es all over the house I felt worse and worseâ at last I got up dressed and soft-ly go-ing down in my stockinged feet sought out my step-moth-er and sud-den-ly threw my-self at her feet be-seech-ing her as a par-tic-u-lar favour to give me a good slip-per-ing for my mis-be-haviour any-thing in-deed but con-demn-ing me to lie abed such an unen-durable length of time But she was the best and most con-sci-en-tious of step-moth-ers and back I had to go to my room For sev-er-al hours I lay there broad awake feel-ing a great deal worse than I have ever done since even from the great-est sub-se-quent mis-for-tunes At last I must have fallen in-to a trou-bled night-mare of a doze and slow-ly wak-ing from itâ half steeped in dream-sâ I opened my eyes and the be-fore sun lit room was now wrapped in outer dark-ness In-stant-ly I felt a shock run-ning through all my frame noth-ing was to be seen and noth-ing was to be heard but a su-per-nat-u-ral hand seemed placed in mine My arm hung over the coun-ter-pane and the name-less un-imag-in-able si-lent form or phan-tom to which the hand be-longed seemed close-ly seat-ed by my bed side For what seemed ages piled on ages I lay there frozen with the most aw-ful fears not dar-ing to drag away my hand yet ever think-ing that if I could but stir it one sin-gle inch the hor-rid spell would be bro-ken I knew not how this con-scious-ness at last glid-ed away from me but wak-ing in the morn-ing I shud-der-ing-ly re-mem-bered it all and for days and weeks and months after-wards I lost my-self in con-found-ing at-temp-ts to ex-plain the mys-tery Nay to this very hour I often puz-zle my-self with it Now take away the aw-ful fear and my sen-sa-tions at feel-ing the su-per-nat-u-ral hand in mine were very sim-i-lar in their strangeness to those which I ex-pe-ri-enced on wak-ing up and see-ing Quee-quegâ s pa-gan arm thrown round me But at length all the past nightâ s even-ts sober-ly re-curred one by one in fixed real-i-ty and then I lay on-ly alive to the com-i-cal predica-ment For though I tried to move his ar-mâ un-lock his bride-groom claspâ yet sleep-ing as he was he still hugged me tight-ly as though naught but death should part us twain I now strove to rouse himâ â Quee-queg â â but his on-ly an-swer was a snore I then rolled over my neck feel-ing as if it were in a horse col-lar and sud-den-ly felt a slight scratch Throw-ing aside the coun-ter-pane there lay the tom-a-hawk sleep-ing by the sav-ageâ s side as if it were a hatch-et faced ba-by A pret-ty pick-le tru-ly thought I abed here in a strange house in the broad day with a can-ni-bal and a tom-a-hawk â Quee-queg â in the name of good-ness Quee-queg wake â At length by dint of much wrig-gling and loud and inces-sant ex-pos-tu-la-tions upon the un-be-com-ing-ness of his hug-ging a fel-low male in that mat-ri-mo-ni-al sort of style I suc-ceed-ed in ex-tract-ing a grunt and present-ly he drew back his arm shook him-self all over like a New-found-land dog just from the water and sat up in bed stiff as a pike staff look-ing at me and rub-bing his eyes as if he did not al-to-geth-er re-mem-ber how I came to be there though a dim con-scious-ness of know-ing some-thing about me seemed slow-ly dawn-ing over him Mean-while I lay qui-et-ly eye-ing him hav-ing no se-ri-ous mis-giv-ings now and bent upon nar-row-ly ob-serv-ing so cu-ri-ous a crea-ture When at last his mind seemed made up touch-ing the char-ac-ter of his bed-fel-low and he be-came as it were rec-on-ciled to the fact he jumped out upon the floor and by cer-tain signs and sounds gave me to un-der-stand that if it pleased me he would dress first and then leave me to dress after-wards leav-ing the whole apart-ment to my-self Thinks I Quee-queg un-der the cir-cum-stances this is a very civ-i-lized over-ture but the truth is th-ese sav-ages have an in-nate sense of del-i-ca-cy say what you will it is marvel-lous how essen-tial-ly po-lite they are I pay this par-tic-u-lar com-pli-ment to Quee-queg be-cause he treat-ed me with so much ci-vil-i-ty and con-sid-er-a-tion while I was guilty of great ru-de-ness star-ing at him from the bed and watch-ing all his toi-lette mo-tions for the time my cu-rios-i-ty get-ting the bet-ter of my breed-ing Nev-er-the-less a man like Quee-queg you donâ t see every day he and his ways were well worth unusu-al re-gard-ing He com-menced dress-ing at top by don-ning his beaver hat a very tall one by the by and thenâ still mi-nus his trowser-sâ he hunt-ed up his boots What un-der the heav-ens he did it for I can-not tell but his next move-ment was to crush him-selfâ boots in hand and hat onâ un-der the bed when from sundry vi-o-lent gasp-ings and strain-ings I in-ferred he was hard at work boot-ing him-self though by no law of pro-pri-ety that I ever heard of is any man re-quired to be pri-vate when put-ting on his boots But Quee-queg do you see was a crea-ture in the tran-si-tion stageâ nei-ther cater-pil-lar nor but-ter-fly He was just enough civ-i-lized to show off his out-landish-ness in the strangest pos-si-ble man-ners His ed-u-ca-tion was not yet com-plet-ed He was an un-der-grad-u-ate If he had not been a small de-gree civ-i-lized he very prob-a-bly would not have trou-bled him-self with boots at all but then if he had not been still a sav-age he nev-er would have dreamt of get-ting un-der the bed to put them on At last he emerged with his hat very much dent-ed and crushed down over his eyes and be-gan creak-ing and limp-ing about the room as if not be-ing much ac-cus-tomed to boots his pair of damp wrin-kled cowhide onesâ prob-a-bly not made to order eitherâ rather pinched and tor-ment-ed him at the first go off of a bit-ter cold morn-ing See-ing now that there were no cur-tains to the win-dow and that the street be-ing very nar-row the house op-po-site com-mand-ed a plain view in-to the room and ob-serv-ing more and more the in-deco-rous fig-ure that Quee-queg made staving about with lit-tle else but his hat and boots on I begged him as well as I could to ac-cel-er-ate his toi-let some-what and par-tic-u-lar-ly to get in-to his pan-taloons as soon as pos-si-ble He com-plied and then pro-ceed-ed to wash him-self At that time in the morn-ing any Chris-tian would have washed his face but Quee-queg to my amaze-ment con-tent-ed him-self with restrict-ing his ablu-tions to his ch-est ar-ms and hands He then donned his waist-coat and tak-ing up a piece of hard soap on the wash stand cen-tre table dipped it in-to water and com-menced lather-ing his face I was watch-ing to see where he kept his ra-zor when lo and be-hold he takes the har-poon from the bed corner slips out the long wood-en stock un-sheathes the head whets it a lit-tle on his boot and strid-ing up to the bit of mir-ror against the wall be-gins a vig-or-ous scrap-ing or rather har-poon-ing of his cheeks Thinks I Quee-queg this is us-ing Roger-sâ s best cut-lery with a vengeance After-wards I won-dered the less at this oper-a-tion when I came to know of what fine steel the head of a har-poon is made and how ex-ceed-ing-ly sharp the long straight edges are al-ways kept The rest of his toi-let was soon achieved and he proud-ly marched out of the room wrapped up in his great pilot mon-key jack-et and sport-ing his har-poon like a mar-shalâ s ba-ton CHAPTER 5 Break-fast I quick-ly fol-lowed suit and descend-ing in-to the bar room ac-cost-ed the grin-ning land-lord very pleas-ant-ly I cher-ished no mal-ice towards him though he had been sky-lark-ing with me not a lit-tle in the mat-ter of my bed-fel-low How-ev-er a good laugh is a mighty good thing and rather too scarce a good thing the moreâ s the pi-ty So if any one man in his own prop-er per-son af-ford stuff for a good joke to any-body let him not be back-ward but let him cheer-ful-ly al-low him-self to spend and be spent in that way And the man that has any-thing boun-ti-ful-ly laugh-able about him be sure there is more in that man than you per-haps think for The bar room was now full of the board-ers who had been drop-ping in the night pre-vi-ous and whom I had not as yet had a good look at They were near-ly all whale-men chief mates and se-cond mates and third mates and sea car-pen-ters and sea coop-ers and sea black-smiths and har-pooneers and ship keep-ers a brown and brawny com-pa-ny with bosky beards an un-shorn shag-gy set all wear-ing mon-key jack-ets for morn-ing gowns You could pret-ty plain-ly tell how long each one had been ashore This young fel-lowâ s healthy cheek is like a sun toast-ed pear in hue and would seem to smell al-most as musky he can-not have been three days land-ed from his In-di-an voy-age That man next him looks a few shades lighter you might say a touch of satin wood is in him In the com-plex-ion of a third still lingers a trop-ic tawn but slight-ly bleached withal he doubt-less has tar-ried whole weeks ashore But who could show a cheek like Quee-queg which barred with var-i-ous tin-ts seemed like the An-desâ western slope to show forth in one ar-ray con-trast-ing cli-mates zone by zone â Grub ho â now cried the land-lord fling-ing open a door and in we went to break-fast They say that men who have seen the world there-by be-come quite at ease in man-ner quite self possessed in com-pa-ny Not al-ways though Led-yard the great New Eng-land trav-eller and Mun-go Park the Scotch one of all men they possessed the least as-sur-ance in the par-lor But per-haps the mere cross-ing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as Led-yard did or the tak-ing a long soli-tary walk on an emp-ty stomach in the ne-gro heart of Africa which was the sum of poor Mun-goâ s per-for-mancesâ this kind of trav-el I say may not be the very best mode of at-tain-ing a high so-cial pol-ish Still for the most part that sort of thing is to be had any-where Th-ese re-flec-tions just here are oc-ca-sioned by the cir-cum-stance that after we were all seat-ed at the table and I was prepar-ing to hear some good sto-ries about whal-ing to my no small sur-prise near-ly every man main-tained a pro-found si-lence And not on-ly that but they looked em-bar-rassed Yes here were a set of sea dogs many of whom without the slight-est bash-ful-ness had board-ed great whales on the high seasâ en-tire strangers to themâ and duelled them dead without wink-ing and yet here they sat at a so-cial break-fast tableâ all of the same calling all of kin-dred tastesâ look-ing round as sheep-ish-ly at each other as though they had nev-er been out of sight of some sheep-fold among the Green Moun-tains A cu-ri-ous sight th-ese bash-ful bears th-ese timid war-rior whale-men But as for Quee-quegâ why Quee-queg sat there among themâ at the head of the table too it so chanced as cool as an ici-cle To be sure I can-not say much for his breed-ing His great-est ad-mirer could not have cor-dial-ly jus-ti-fied his bring-ing his har-poon in-to break-fast with him and us-ing it there without cer-e-mo-ny reach-ing over the table with it to the im-mi-nent jeop-ardy of many heads and grap-pling the beef-steaks towards him But that was cer-tain-ly very cool-ly done by him and every one knows that in most peo-pleâ s es-ti-ma-tion to do any-thing cool-ly is to do it gen-teel-ly We will not speak of all Quee-quegâ s pe-cu-liar-i-ties here how he eschewed cof-fee and hot rol-ls and ap-plied his un-di-vid-ed at-ten-tion to beef-steaks done rare Enough that when break-fast was over he with-drew like the rest in-to the public room light-ed his tom-a-hawk pipe and was sit-ting there qui-et-ly digest-ing and smok-ing with his insep-a-ra-ble hat on when I sal-lied out for a stroll CHAPTER 6 The Street If I had been as-ton-ished at first catch-ing a glimpse of so out-landish an in-di-vid-u-al as Quee-queg cir-cu-lat-ing among the po-lite so-ci-ety of a civ-i-lized town that as-ton-ish-ment soon depart-ed upon tak-ing my first day-light stroll through the streets of New Bed-ford In thor-ough-fares nigh the docks any con-sid-er-able sea-port will fre-quent-ly of-fer to view the queer-est look-ing non-de-scrip-ts from for-eign parts Even in Broad-way and Ch-est-nut streets Mediter-ranean mariners will some-times jos-tle the af-fright-ed ladies Re-gent Street is not un-known to Las-cars and Malays and at Bom-bay in the Apol-lo Green live Yan-kees have often scared the na-tives But New Bed-ford beats all Water Street and Wap-ping In th-ese last men-tioned haun-ts you see on-ly sailors but in New Bed-ford ac-tu-al can-ni-bals stand chat-ting at street corners sav-ages outright many of whom yet car-ry on their bones un-holy flesh It makes a stranger stare But be-sides the Feegeeans Ton-ga-to-booar-rs Er-ro-mang-goans Pan-nan-gians and Brighg-gians and be-sides the wild spec-i-mens of the whal-ing craft which un-heed-ed reel about the streets you will see other sights still more cu-ri-ous cer-tain-ly more com-i-cal There week-ly ar-rive in this town scores of green Ver-mon-ters and New Hamp-shire men all athirst for gain and glo-ry in the fish-ery They are most-ly young of stal-wart frames fel-lows who have felled forests and now seek to drop the axe and snatch the whale lance Many are as green as the Green Moun-tains whence they came In some things you would think them but a few hours old Look there that chap strut-ting round the corner He wears a beaver hat and swal-low tailed coat gir-dled with a sailor belt and sheath knife Here comes another with a souâ wester and a bom-bazine cloak No town bred dandy will com-pare with a coun-try bred oneâ I mean a down-right bump-kin dandyâ a fel-low that in the dog days will mow his two acres in buck-skin gloves for fear of tan-ning his hands Now when a coun-try dandy like this takes it in-to his head to make a distin-guished rep-u-ta-tion and joins the great whale fish-ery you should see the com-i-cal things he does upon reach-ing the sea-port In be-s-peak-ing his sea out-fit he orders bell but-tons to his waist-coats straps to his can-vas trowsers Ah poor Hay Seed how bit-ter-ly will burst those straps in the first howl-ing gale when thou art driv-en straps but-tons and all down the throat of the tem-pest But think not that this fa-mous town has on-ly har-pooneers can-ni-bals and bump-kins to show her visi-tors Not at all Still New Bed-ford is a queer place Had it not been for us whale-men that tract of land would this day per-haps have been in as howl-ing con-di-tion as the coast of Labrador As it is parts of her back coun-try are enough to fright-en one they look so bony The town it-self is per-haps the dear-est place to live in in all New Eng-land It is a land of oil true enough but not like Canaan a land al-so of corn and wine The streets do not run with milk nor in the spring time do they pave them with fresh eg-gs Yet in spite of this nowhere in all Amer-i-ca will you find more pa-tri-cian like hous-es parks and gar-dens more opu-lent than in New Bed-ford Whence came they how plant-ed upon this once scrag-gy sco-ria of a coun-try Go and gaze upon the iron em-blem-at-i-cal har-poons round yon-der lofty man-sion and your ques-tion will be an-swered Yes all th-ese brave hous-es and flow-ery gar-dens came from the At-lantic Pa-cif-ic and In-di-an oceans One and all they were har-pooned and dragged up hither from the bot-tom of the sea Can Herr Alexan-der per-form a feat like that In New Bed-ford fathers they say give whales for dow-ers to their daugh-ters and por-tion off their nieces with a few por-pois-es a piece You must go to New Bed-ford to see a bril-liant wed-ding for they say they have reser-voirs of oil in every house and every night reck-less-ly burn their lengths in sper-ma-ceti can-dles In sum-mer time the town is sweet to see full of fine maplesâ long av-enues of green and gold And in Au-gust high in air the beau-ti-ful and boun-ti-ful horse ch-est-nuts can-de-labra wise prof-fer the pass-er by their taper-ing upright cones of con-gre-gat-ed blos-soms So om-nipo-tent is art which in many a district of New Bed-ford has su-perin-duced bright ter-races of flow-ers upon the bar-ren refuse rocks thrown aside at creationâ s fi-nal day And the women of New Bed-ford they bloom like their own red ros-es But ros-es on-ly bloom in sum-mer where-as the fine car-na-tion of their cheeks is peren-ni-al as sun-light in the seventh heav-ens Else-where match that bloom of theirs ye can-not save in Salem where they tell me the young gir-ls breathe such musk their sailor sweet-hearts smell them miles off shore as though they were draw-ing nigh the odorous Moluc-cas in-stead of the Pu-ri-tan-ic sands CHAPTER 7 The Chapel In this same New Bed-ford there stands a Whale-manâ s Chapel and few are the moody fish-er-men short-ly bound for the In-di-an Ocean or Pa-cif-ic who fail to make a Sun-day visit to the spot I am sure that I did not Re-turn-ing from my first morn-ing stroll I again sal-lied out upon this spe-cial er-rand The sky had changed from clear sun-ny cold to driv-ing sleet and mist Wrap-ping my-self in my shag-gy jack-et of the cloth called bearskin I fought my way against the stub-born storm En-ter-ing I found a small scat-tered con-gre-ga-tion of sailors and sailorsâ wives and wi-d-ows A muf-fled si-lence reigned on-ly bro-ken at times by the shrieks of the storm Each si-lent wor-ship-per seemed pur-pose-ly sit-ting apart from the other as if each si-lent grief were in-su-lar and in-com-mu-ni-ca-ble The chap-lain had not yet ar-rived and there th-ese si-lent is-lands of men and women sat stead-fast-ly eye-ing sev-er-al mar-ble tablets with black borders ma-soned in-to the wall on either side the pul-pit Three of them ran some-thing like the fol-low-ing but I do not pre-tend to quote â SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF JOHN TALBOT Who at the age of eigh-teen was lost over-board Near the Isle of Deso-la-tion off Patag-o-nia Novem-ber 1 st 1836 THIS TABLET Is erect-ed to his Me-mory BY HIS SISTER SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF ROBERT LONG WILLIS ELLERY NATHAN COLEMAN WALTER CANNY SETH MACY AND SAMUEL GLEIG Form-ing one of the boat-sâ crews OF THE SHIP ELIZA Who were towed out of sight by a Whale On the Off

killed by a Sperm Whale on the coast of Ja-pan Au-gust 3 d 1833 THIS TABLET Is erect-ed to his Me-mory BY HIS WIDOW Shak-ing off the sleet from my ice glazed hat and jack-et I seat-ed my-self near the door and turn-ing side-ways was sur-prised to see Quee-queg near me Af-fect-ed by the solem-ni-ty of the scene there was a won-der-ing gaze of in-cred-u-lous cu-rios-i-ty in his coun-te-nance This sav-age was the on-ly per-son pre-sent who seemed to no-tice my en-trance be-cause he was the on-ly one who could not read and there-fore was not read-ing those frigid in-scrip-tions on the wall Whether any of the rel-a-tives of the sea-men whose names ap-peared there were now among the con-gre-ga-tion I knew not but so many are the un-record-ed ac-ci-den-ts in the fish-ery and so plain-ly did sev-er-al women pre-sent wear the coun-te-nance if not the trap-pings of some unceas-ing grief that I feel sure that here be-fore me were assem-bled those in whose un-heal-ing hearts the sight of those bleak tablets sym-pa-thet-i-cal-ly caused the old wounds to bleed afresh Oh ye whose dead lie buried be-neath the green grass who stand-ing among flow-ers can sayâ here here lies my beloved ye know not the deso-la-tion that broods in bo-soms like th-ese What bit-ter blanks in those black bordered mar-bles which cover no ash-es What de-s-pair in those im-mov-able in-scrip-tions What dead-ly voids and un-bid-den in-fi-deli-ties in the lines that seem to gnaw upon all Faith and refuse res-ur-rec-tions to the be-ings who have place-less-ly per-ished without a grave As well might those tablets stand in the cave of Ele-phan-ta as here In what cen-sus of liv-ing crea-tures the dead of mankind are in-clud-ed why it is that a univer-sal proverb says of them that they tell no tales though con-tain-ing more se-crets than the Good-win Sands how it is that to his name who yes-ter-day depart-ed for the other world we pre-fix so sig-nif-i-cant and in-fi-del a word and yet do not thus en-ti-tle him if he but em-barks for the re-motest Indies of this liv-ing earth why the Life In-surance Com-pa-nies pay death for-fei-tures upon im-mor-tals in what eter-nal un-stir-ring paral-y-sis and dead-ly hope-less trance yet lies an-tique Adam who died six-ty round cen-turies ago how it is that we still refuse to be com-fort-ed for those who we nev-er-the-less main-tain are dwelling in un-speak-able bliss why all the liv-ing so strive to hush all the dead where-fore but the ru-mor of a knock-ing in a tomb will ter-ri-fy a whole ci-ty All th-ese things are not without their mean-ings But Faith like a jack-al feeds among the tom-bs and even from th-ese dead doubts she gathers her most vi-tal hope It needs scarce-ly to be told with what feel-ings on the eve of a Nan-tuck-et voy-age I re-gard-ed those mar-ble tablets and by the murky light of that darkened dole-ful day read the fate of the whale-men who had gone be-fore me Yes Ish-mael the same fate may be thine But some-how I grew mer-ry again De-light-ful in-duce-men-ts to em-bark fine chance for pro-mo-tion it seem-sâ aye a stove boat will make me an im-mor-tal by brevet Yes there is death in this busi-ness of whal-ingâ a speech-less-ly quick chaot-ic bundling of a man in-to Eter-ni-ty But what then Me-thinks we have huge-ly mis-tak-en this mat-ter of Life and Death Me-thinks that what they call my shad-ow here on earth is my true sub-stance Me-thinks that in look-ing at things spir-i-tu-al we are too much like oys-ters ob-serv-ing the sun through the water and think-ing that thick water the thinnest of air Me-thinks my body is but the lees of my bet-ter be-ing In fact take my body who will take it I say it is not me And there-fore three cheers for Nan-tuck-et and come a stove boat and stove body when they will for stave my soul Jove him-self can-not CHAPTER 8 The Pul-pit I had not been seat-ed very long ere a man of a cer-tain ven-er-a-ble ro-bust-ness en-tered im-me-di-ate-ly as the storm pelt-ed door flew back upon ad-mit-ting him a quick re-gard-ful eye-ing of him by all the con-gre-ga-tion suf-fi-cient-ly attest-ed that this fine old man was the chap-lain Yes it was the fa-mous Father Map-ple so called by the whale-men among whom he was a very great favourite He had been a sailor and a har-pooneer in his youth but for many years past had ded-i-cat-ed his life to the min-istry At the time I now write of Father Map-ple was in the hardy win-ter of a healthy old age that sort of old age which seems merg-ing in-to a se-cond flow-er-ing youth for among all the fis-sures of his wrin-kles there shone cer-tain mild gleams of a new-ly devel-op-ing bloomâ the spring ver-dure peep-ing forth even be-neath Fe-bru-aryâ s snow No one hav-ing pre-vi-ous-ly heard his his-to-ry could for the first time be-hold Father Map-ple without the ut-most in-ter-est be-cause there were cer-tain en-graft-ed cler-i-cal pe-cu-liar-i-ties about him im-putable to that ad-ven-tur-ous mar-itime life he had led When he en-tered I ob-served that he car-ried no um-brel-la and cer-tain-ly had not come in his car-riage for his tarpaulin hat ran down with melt-ing sleet and his great pilot cloth jack-et seemed al-most to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had ab-sorbed How-ev-er hat and coat and over-shoes were one by one re-moved and hung up in a lit-tle space in an ad-ja-cent corner when ar-rayed in a de-cent suit he qui-et-ly ap-proached the pul-pit Like most old fash-ioned pul-pits it was a very lofty one and since a reg-u-lar stairs to such a height would by its long an-gle with the floor se-ri-ous-ly con-tract the al-ready small area of the chapel the ar-chi-tect it seemed had act-ed upon the hint of Father Map-ple and fin-ished the pul-pit without a stairs sub-sti-tut-ing a per-pen-dic-u-lar side lad-der like those used in mount-ing a ship from a boat at sea The wife of a whal-ing cap-tain had pro-vid-ed the chapel with a hand-some pair of red worsted man ropes for this lad-der which be-ing it-self nice-ly head-ed and stained with a ma-hogany colour the whole con-trivance con-sid-er-ing what man-ner of chapel it was seemed by no means in bad taste Halt-ing for an in-stant at the foot of the lad-der and with both hands grasp-ing the or-na-men-tal knobs of the man ropes Father Map-ple cast a look up-wards and then with a tru-ly sailor like but still rev-er-en-tial dex-ter-i-ty hand over hand mount-ed the steps as if as-cend-ing the main top of his ves-sel The per-pen-dic-u-lar parts of this side lad-der as is usu-al-ly the case with swing-ing ones were of cloth covered rope on-ly the rounds were of wood so that at every step there was a joint At my first glimpse of the pul-pit it had not es-caped me that how-ev-er con-ve-nient for a ship th-ese join-ts in the pre-sent in-stance seemed un-nec-es-sary For I was not pre-pared to see Father Map-ple after gain-ing the height slow-ly turn round and stoop-ing over the pul-pit de-lib-er-ate-ly drag up the lad-der step by step till the whole was de-posit-ed within leav-ing him im-preg-nable in his lit-tle Que-bec I pon-dered some time without ful-ly com-pre-hend-ing the rea-son for this Father Map-ple en-joyed such a wide rep-u-ta-tion for sin-cer-i-ty and sanc-ti-ty that I could not sus-pect him of court-ing no-to-ri-ety by any mere tricks of the stage No thought I there must be some sober rea-son for this thing fur-ther-more it must sym-bol-ize some-thing unseen Can it be then that by that act of phys-i-cal iso-la-tion he sig-ni-fies his spir-i-tu-al with-draw-al for the time from all out-ward world-ly ties and con-nex-ions Yes for re-plen-ished with the meat and wine of the word to the faith-ful man of God this pul-pit I see is a self con-tain-ing strongholdâ a lofty Ehren-bre-it-stein with a peren-ni-al well of water within the wal-ls But the side lad-der was not the on-ly strange fea-ture of the place bor-rowed from the chap-lainâ s former sea far-ings Between the mar-ble ceno-taphs on either hand of the pul-pit the wall which formed its back was adorned with a large paint-ing rep-re-sent-ing a gal-lant ship beat-ing against a ter-ri-ble storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy break-ers But high above the fly-ing scud and dark rolling clouds there float-ed a lit-tle isle of sun-light from which beamed forth an an-gelâ s face and this bright face shed a distinct spot of ra-di-ance upon the shipâ s tossed deck some-thing like that sil-ver plate now insert-ed in-to the Vic-to-ryâ s plank where Nel-son fell â Ah noble ship â the an-gel seemed to say â beat on beat on thou noble ship and bear a hardy helm for lo the sun is break-ing through the clouds are rolling of-fâ seren-est azure is at hand â Nor was the pul-pit it-self without a trace of the same sea taste that had achieved the lad-der and the pic-ture Its panelled front was in the like-ness of a shipâ s bluff bows and the Holy Bi-ble rest-ed on a pro-ject-ing piece of scroll work fash-ioned after a shipâ s fid-dle head-ed beak What could be more full of mean-ing â for the pul-pit is ever this earthâ s fore-most part all the rest comes in its rear the pul-pit leads the world From thence it is the storm of Godâ s quick wrath is first de-scried and the bow must bear the ear-li-est brunt From thence it is the God of breezes fair or foul is first in-voked for favourable winds Yes the worldâ s a ship on its pas-sage out and not a voy-age com-plete and the pul-pit is its prow CHAPTER 9 The Ser-mon Father Map-ple rose and in a mild voice of unas-sum-ing author-i-ty ordered the scat-tered peo-ple to con-dense â Star-board gang-way there side away to lar-boardâ lar-board gang-way to star-board Mid-ships mid-ships â There was a low rum-bling of heavy sea boots among the bench-es and a still slighter shuf-fling of womenâ s shoes and all was qui-et again and every eye on the preach-er He paused a lit-tle then kneel-ing in the pul-pitâ s bows fold-ed his large brown hands across his ch-est uplift-ed his closed eyes and of-fered a pray-er so deeply devout that he seemed kneel-ing and pray-ing at the bot-tom of the sea This end-ed in pro-longed solemn tones like the con-tin-u-al tolling of a bell in a ship that is founder-ing at sea in a fogâ in such tones he com-menced read-ing the fol-low-ing hymn but chang-ing his man-ner towards the con-clud-ing stan-zas burst forth with a peal-ing ex-ul-ta-tion and joyâ â The ribs and ter-rors in the whale Arched over me a dis-mal gloom While all Godâ s sun lit waves rolled by And lift me deep-en-ing down to doom â I saw the open-ing maw of hell With end-less pains and sor-rows there Which none but they that feel can tel-lâ Oh I was plung-ing to de-s-pair â In black distress I called my God When I could scarce believe him mine He bowed his ear to my com-plaintsâ No more the whale did me con-fine â With speed he flew to my relief As on a ra-di-ant dol-phin borne Aw-ful yet bright as light-ning shone The face of my De-liv-erer God â My song for ever shall record That ter-ri-ble that joy-ful hour I give the glo-ry to my God His all the mer-cy and the pow-er â Near-ly all joined in sing-ing this hymn which swelled high above the howl-ing of the storm A brief pause en-sued the preach-er slow-ly turned over the leaves of the Bi-ble and at last fold-ing his hand down upon the prop-er page said â Beloved ship-mates clinch the last verse of the first chap-ter of Jon-ahâ â And God had pre-pared a great fish to swal-low up Jon-ah â â â Ship-mates this book con-tain-ing on-ly four chap-ter-sâ four yarn-sâ is one of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the Scrip-tures Yet what depths of the soul does Jon-ahâ s deep sealine sound what a preg-nant les-son to us is this prophet What a noble thing is that can-ti-cle in the fishâ s bel-ly How bil-low like and bois-ter-ous-ly grand We feel the floods surg-ing over us we sound with him to the kelpy bot-tom of the waters sea weed and all the slime of the sea is about us But what is this les-son that the book of Jon-ah teach-es Ship-mates it is a two strand-ed les-son a les-son to us all as sin-ful men and a les-son to me as a pilot of the liv-ing God As sin-ful men it is a les-son to us all be-cause it is a sto-ry of the sin hard heart-ed-ness sud-den-ly awak-ened fears the swift pu-n-ish-ment re-pen-tance pray-ers and fi-nal-ly the de-liv-er-ance and joy of Jon-ah As with all sin-ners among men the sin of this son of Amit-tai was in his wil-ful disobe-di-ence of the com-mand of Godâ nev-er mind now what that com-mand was or how con-veyedâ which he found a hard com-mand But all the things that God would have us do are hard for us to doâ re-mem-ber thatâ and hence he often-er com-mands us than en-deav-ors to per-suade And if we obey God we must disobey our-selves and it is in this disobey-ing our-selves where-in the hard-ness of obey-ing God con-sists â With this sin of disobe-di-ence in him Jon-ah still fur-ther flouts at God by seek-ing to flee from Him He thinks that a ship made by men will car-ry him in-to coun-tries where God does not reign but on-ly the Cap-tains of this earth He skulks about the wharves of Jop-pa and seeks a ship thatâ s bound for Tarshish There lurks per-haps a hither-to un-heed-ed mean-ing here By all ac-coun-ts Tarshish could have been no other ci-ty than the modern Cadiz Thatâ s the opin-ion of learned men And where is Cadiz ship-mates Cadiz is in Spain as far by water from Jop-pa as Jon-ah could pos-si-bly have sailed in those an-cient days when the At-lantic was an al-most un-known sea Be-cause Jop-pa the modern Jaf-fa ship-mates is on the most easter-ly coast of the Mediter-ranean the Syr-i-an and Tarshish or Cadiz more than two thou-sand miles to the west-ward from that just out-side the Straits of Gi-bral-tar See ye not then ship-mates that Jon-ah sought to flee world wide from God Mis-er-able man Oh most con-temptible and wor-thy of all scorn with slouched hat and guilty eye skulk-ing from his God prowl-ing among the ship-ping like a vile bur-glar has-ten-ing to cross the seas So disor-dered self con-demn-ing is his look that had there been po-lice-men in those days Jon-ah on the mere sus-pi-cion of some-thing wrong had been ar-rest-ed ere he touched a deck How plain-ly heâ s a fugi-tive no bag-gage not a hat box valise or car-pet bag â no friends ac-com-pa-ny him to the wharf with their adieux At last after much dodg-ing search he finds the Tarshish ship re-ceiv-ing the last items of her car-go and as he steps on board to see its Cap-tain in the cabin all the sailors for the mo-ment de-sist from hoist-ing in the goods to mark the strangerâ s evil eye Jon-ah sees this but in vain he tries to look all ease and con-fi-dence in vain es-says his wretched smile Strong in-tu-itions of the man as-sure the mariners he can be no in-no-cent In their game-some but still se-ri-ous way one whis-pers to the otherâ â Jack heâ s robbed a wi-d-ow â or â Joe do you mark him heâ s a bigamist â or â Har-ry lad I guess heâ s the adul-terer that broke jail in old Go-mor-rah or be-like one of the miss-ing mur-der-ers from Sodom â Another runs to read the bill thatâ s stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is moored of-fer-ing five hun-dred gold coins for the ap-pre-hen-sion of a par-ri-cide and con-tain-ing a de-scrip-tion of his per-son He reads and looks from Jon-ah to the bill while all his sym-pa-thet-ic ship-mates now crowd round Jon-ah pre-pared to lay their hands upon him Fright-ed Jon-ah trem-bles and sum-mon-ing all his bold-ness to his face on-ly looks so much the more a coward He will not con-fess him-self sus-pect-ed but that it-self is strong sus-pi-cion So he makes the best of it and when the sailors find him not to be the man that is ad-ver-tised they let him pass and he descends in-to the cabin â â Whoâ s there â cries the Cap-tain at his busy desk hur-ried-ly mak-ing out his papers for the Cus-tom-sâ â Whoâ s there â Oh how that harm-less ques-tion man-gles Jon-ah For the in-stant he al-most turns to flee again But he ral-lies â I seek a pas-sage in this ship to Tarshish how soon sail ye sir â Thus far the busy Cap-tain had not looked up to Jon-ah though the man now stands be-fore him but no soon-er does he hear that hol-low voice than he darts a scru-ti-niz-ing glance â We sail with the next com-ing tide â at last he slow-ly an-swered still in-tent-ly eye-ing him â No soon-er sir â â â Soon enough for any hon-est man that goes a pas-sen-ger â Ha Jon-ah thatâ s another stab But he swift-ly cal-ls away the Cap-tain from that scent â Iâ ll sail with ye â â he says â â the pas-sage money how much is that â Iâ ll pay now â For it is par-tic-u-lar-ly writ-ten ship-mates as if it were a thing not to be over-looked in this his-to-ry â that he paid the fare there-ofâ ere the craft did sail And tak-en with the con-text this is full of mean-ing â Now Jon-ahâ s Cap-tain ship-mates was one whose dis-cern-ment de-tec-ts crime in any but whose cu-pid-i-ty ex-pos-es it on-ly in the pen-ni-less In this world ship-mates sin that pays its way can trav-el freely and without a pass-port where-as Virtue if a pau-per is stopped at all fron-tiers So Jon-ahâ s Cap-tain pre-pares to test the length of Jon-ahâ s purse ere he judge him open-ly He charges him thrice the usu-al sum and itâ s assent-ed to Then the Cap-tain knows that Jon-ah is a fugi-tive but at the same time re-solves to help a flight that paves its rear with gold Yet when Jon-ah fair-ly takes out his purse pru-dent sus-pi-cions still molest the Cap-tain He rings every coin to find a coun-ter-feit Not a forg-er any way he mut-ters and Jon-ah is put down for his pas-sage â Point out my state room Sir â says Jon-ah now â Iâ m trav-el weary I need sleep â â Thou look-est like it â says the Cap-tain â thereâ s thy room â Jon-ah en-ters and would lock the door but the lock con-tains no key Hear-ing him fool-ish-ly fum-bling there the Cap-tain laughs low-ly to him-self and mut-ters some-thing about the doors of con-vict-sâ cel-ls be-ing nev-er al-lowed to be locked within All dressed and dusty as he is Jon-ah throws him-self in-to his berth and finds the lit-tle state room ceil-ing al-most rest-ing on his fore-head The air is close and Jon-ah gasps Then in that con-tract-ed hole sunk too be-neath the shipâ s water line Jon-ah feels the herald-ing pre-sen-ti-ment of that sti-fling hour when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of his bow-el-sâ wards â Screwed at its ax-is against the side a swing-ing lamp slight-ly os-cil-lates in Jon-ahâ s room and the ship heel-ing over towards the wharf with the weight of the last bales re-ceived the lamp flame and all though in slight mo-tion still main-tains a per-ma-nent obliq-ui-ty with ref-er-ence to the room though in truth in-fal-li-bly straight it-self it but made ob-vi-ous the false ly-ing levels among which it hung The lamp alar-ms and fright-ens Jon-ah as ly-ing in his berth his tor-ment-ed eyes roll round the place and this thus far suc-cess-ful fugi-tive finds no refuge for his rest-less glance But that con-tra-dic-tion in the lamp more and more ap-pals him The floor the ceil-ing and the side are all awry â Oh so my con-science hangs in me â he groans â straight up-wards so it burns but the cham-bers of my soul are all in crooked-ness â â Like one who after a night of drunk-en revel-ry hies to his bed still reel-ing but with con-science yet prick-ing him as the plung-ings of the Ro-man race horse but so much the more strike his steel tags in-to him as one who in that mis-er-able plight still turns and turns in gid-dy an-guish pray-ing God for an-ni-hi-la-tion un-til the fit be passed and at last amid the whirl of woe he feels a deep stu-por steals over him as over the man who bleeds to death for con-science is the wound and thereâ s naught to staunch it so after sore wrestlings in his berth Jon-ahâ s prodi-gy of pon-der-ous mis-ery drags him drown-ing down to sleep â And now the time of tide has come the ship casts off her cables and from the de-sert-ed wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish all ca-reen-ing glides to sea That ship my friends was the first of record-ed smug-glers the con-tra-band was Jon-ah But the sea rebels he will not bear the wicked bur-den A dread-ful storm comes on the ship is like to break But now when the boatswain cal-ls all hands to light-en her when box-es bales and jars are clat-ter-ing over-board when the wind is shriek-ing and the men are yelling and every plank thun-ders with tram-pling feet right over Jon-ahâ s head in all this rag-ing tu-mult Jon-ah sleeps his hideous sleep He sees no black sky and rag-ing sea feels not the reel-ing tim-bers and lit-tle hears he or heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale which even now with open mouth is cleav-ing the seas after him Aye ship-mates Jon-ah was gone down in-to the sides of the shipâ a berth in the cabin as I have tak-en it and was fast asleep But the fright-ened master comes to him and shrieks in his dead ear â What mean-est thou O sleep-er arise â Star-tled from his lethar-gy by that dire-ful cry Jon-ah stag-gers to his feet and stum-bling to the deck grasps a shroud to look out upon the sea But at that mo-ment he is sprung upon by a pan-ther bil-low leap-ing over the bul-warks Wave after wave thus leaps in-to the ship and find-ing no speedy vent runs roar-ing fore and aft till the mariners come nigh to drown-ing while yet afloat And ever as the white moon shows her af-fright-ed face from the steep gul-lies in the black-ness over-head aghast Jon-ah sees the rear-ing bowsprit point-ing high up-ward but soon beat down-ward again towards the tor-ment-ed deep â Ter-rors upon ter-rors run shout-ing through his soul In all his cring-ing at-ti-tudes the God fugi-tive is now too plain-ly known The sailors mark him more and more cer-tain grow their sus-pi-cions of him and at last ful-ly to test the truth by re-fer-ring the whole mat-ter to high Heav-en they fall to cast-ing lots to see for whose cause this great tem-pest was upon them The lot is Jon-ahâ s that dis-cov-ered then how fu-ri-ous-ly they mob him with their ques-tions â What is thine oc-cu-pa-tion Whence comest thou Thy coun-try What peo-ple But mark now my ship-mates the be-hav-ior of poor Jon-ah The eager mariners but ask him who he is and where from where-as they not on-ly re-ceive an an-swer to those ques-tions but like-wise another an-swer to a ques-tion not put by them but the un-so-licit-ed an-swer is forced from Jon-ah by the hard hand of God that is upon him â â I am a He-brew â he criesâ and thenâ â I fear the Lord the God of Heav-en who hath made the sea and the dry land â Fear him O Jon-ah Aye well might-est thou fear the Lord God then Straight-way he now goes on to make a full con-fes-sion where-upon the mariners be-came more and more ap-palled but still are pi-ti-ful For when Jon-ah not yet sup-pli-cat-ing God for mer-cy since he but too well knew the dark-ness of his deserts â when wretched Jon-ah cries out to them to take him and cast him forth in-to the sea for he knew that for his sake this great tem-pest was upon them they mer-ci-ful-ly turn from him and seek by other means to save the ship But all in vain the indig-nant gale howls loud-er then with one hand raised in-vok-ing-ly to God with the other they not un-re-luc-tant-ly lay hold of Jon-ah â And now be-hold Jon-ah tak-en up as an an-chor and dropped in-to the sea when in-stant-ly an oi-ly calm-ness floats out from the east and the sea is still as Jon-ah car-ries down the gale with him leav-ing smooth water be-hind He goes down in the whirling heart of such a master-less com-mo-tion that he scarce heeds the mo-ment when he drops seething in-to the yawn-ing jaws await-ing him and the whale shoots to all his ivory teeth like so many white bolts upon his pri-son Then Jon-ah prayed un-to the Lord out of the fishâ s bel-ly But ob-serve his pray-er and learn a weighty les-son For sin-ful as he is Jon-ah does not weep and wail for direct de-liv-er-ance He feels that his dread-ful pu-n-ish-ment is just He leaves all his de-liv-er-ance to God con-tent-ing him-self with this that spite of all his pains and pangs he will still look towards His holy tem-ple And here ship-mates is true and faith-ful re-pen-tance not clam-orous for par-don but grate-ful for pu-n-ish-ment And how pleas-ing to God was this con-duct in Jon-ah is shown in the even-tu-al de-liv-er-ance of him from the sea and the whale Ship-mates I do not place Jon-ah be-fore you to be copied for his sin but I do place him be-fore you as a model for re-pen-tance Sin not but if you do take heed to re-pent of it like Jon-ah â While he was speak-ing th-ese words the howl-ing of the shriek-ing slant-ing storm without seemed to add new pow-er to the preach-er who when de-scrib-ing Jon-ahâ s sea storm seemed tossed by a storm him-self His deep ch-est heaved as with a ground swell his tossed ar-ms seemed the war-ring ele-men-ts at work and the thun-ders that rolled away from off his swarthy brow and the light leap-ing from his eye made all his sim-ple hear-ers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them There now came a lull in his look as he si-lent-ly turned over the leaves of the Book once more and at last stand-ing mo-tion-less with closed eyes for the mo-ment seemed com-muning with God and him-self But again he leaned over towards the peo-ple and bow-ing his head low-ly with an aspect of the deep-est yet man-li-est hu-mil-i-ty he spake th-ese words â Ship-mates God has laid but one hand upon you both his hands press upon me I have read ye by what murky light may be mine the les-son that Jon-ah teach-es to all sin-ners and there-fore to ye and still more to me for I am a greater sin-ner than ye And now how glad-ly would I come down from this mast head and sit on the hatch-es there where you sit and lis-ten as you lis-ten while some one of you reads me that other and more aw-ful les-son which Jon-ah teach-es to me as a pilot of the liv-ing God How be-ing an anoint-ed pilot prophet or speak-er of true things and bid-den by the Lord to sound those un-wel-come truths in the ears of a wicked Nin-eveh Jon-ah ap-palled at the hos-til-i-ty he should raise fled from his mis-sion and sought to es-cape his du-ty and his God by tak-ing ship at Jop-pa But God is every-where Tarshish he nev-er reached As we have seen God came upon him in the whale and swal-lowed him down to liv-ing gulfs of doom and with swift slant-ings tore him along â in-to the midst of the seas â where the ed-dy-ing depths sucked him ten thou-sand fath-oms down and â the weeds were wrapped about his head â and all the watery world of woe bowled over him Yet even then beyond the reach of any plum-metâ â out of the bel-ly of hel-lâ â when the whale ground-ed upon the oceanâ s ut-most bones even then God heard the en-gulphed re-pent-ing prophet when he cried Then God spake un-to the fish and from the shud-der-ing cold and black-ness of the sea the whale came breech-ing up towards the warm and pleas-ant sun and all the de-lights of air and earth and â vomit-ed out Jon-ah upon the dry land â when the word of the Lord came a se-cond time and Jon-ah bruised and beat-enâ his ears like two sea shel-ls still mul-ti-tudi-nous-ly mur-mur-ing of the oceanâ Jon-ah did the Almightyâ s bid-ding And what was that ship-mates To preach the Truth to the face of False-hood That was it â This ship-mates this is that other les-son and woe to that pilot of the liv-ing God who slights it Woe to him whom this world char-ms from Gospel du-ty Woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when God has brewed them in-to a gale Woe to him who seeks to please rather than to ap-pal Woe to him whose good name is more to him than good-ness Woe to him who in this world courts not dis-hon-or Woe to him who would not be true even though to be false were sal-va-tion Yea woe to him who as the great Pilot Paul has it while preach-ing to others is him-self a cast-away â He dropped and fell away from him-self for a mo-ment then lift-ing his face to them again showed a deep joy in his eyes as he cried out with a heav-en-ly en-thu-si-asm â â But oh ship-mates on the star-board hand of every woe there is a sure de-light and higher the top of that de-light than the bot-tom of the woe is deep Is not the main truck higher than the kel-son is low De-light is to himâ a far far up-ward and in-ward de-lightâ who against the proud gods and com-modores of this earth ever stands forth his own inex-orable self De-light is to him whose strong ar-ms yet sup-port him when the ship of this base treach-er-ous world has gone down be-neath him De-light is to him who gives no quar-ter in the truth and kil-ls burns and de-stroys all sin though he pluck it out from un-der the robes of Se-na-tors and Judges De-light â top gal-lant de-light is to him who ac-knowl-edges no law or lord but the Lord his God and is on-ly a pa-tri-ot to heav-en De-light is to him whom all the waves of the bil-lows of the seas of the bois-ter-ous mob can nev-er shake from this sure Keel of the Ages And eter-nal de-light and de-li-cious-ness will be his who com-ing to lay him down can say with his fi-nal breathâ O Father â chiefly known to me by Thy rodâ mor-tal or im-mor-tal here I die I have striv-en to be Thine more than to be this worldâ s or mine own Yet this is noth-ing I leave eter-ni-ty to Thee for what is man that he should live out the life-time of his God â He said no more but slow-ly wav-ing a bene-dic-tion covered his face with his hands and so re-mained kneel-ing till all the peo-ple had depart-ed and he was left alone in the place CHAPTER 1 A Bo-som Friend Re-turn-ing to the Spouter Inn from the Chapel I found Quee-queg there quite alone he hav-ing left the Chapel be-fore the bene-dic-tion some time He was sit-ting on a bench be-fore the fire with his feet on the stove hearth and in one hand was hold-ing close up to his face that lit-tle ne-gro idol of his peer-ing hard in-to its face and with a jack knife gent-ly whit-tling away at its nose mean-while hum-ming to him-self in his hea-then-ish way But be-ing now in-ter-rupt-ed he put up the image and pret-ty soon go-ing to the table took up a large book there and plac-ing it on his lap be-gan count-ing the pages with de-lib-er-ate reg-u-lar-i-ty at every fifti-eth pageâ as I fan-ciedâ stop-ping a mo-ment look-ing va-cant-ly around him and giv-ing ut-ter-ance to a long drawn gur-gling whis-tle of as-ton-ish-ment He would then be-gin again at the next fifty seem-ing to com-mence at num-ber one each time as though he could not count more than fifty and it was on-ly by such a large num-ber of fifties be-ing found to-geth-er that his as-ton-ish-ment at the mul-ti-tude of pages was ex-cit-ed With much in-ter-est I sat watch-ing him Sav-age though he was and hideous-ly marred about the faceâ at least to my tasteâ his coun-te-nance yet had a some-thing in it which was by no means dis-agree-able You can-not hide the soul Through all his un-earth-ly tat-too-ings I thought I saw the traces of a sim-ple hon-est heart and in his large deep eyes fiery black and bold there seemed to-kens of a spir-it that would dare a thou-sand devils And be-sides all this there was a cer-tain lofty bear-ing about the Pa-gan which even his un-couth-ness could not al-to-geth-er maim He looked like a man who had nev-er cringed and nev-er had had a cred-i-tor Whether it was too that his head be-ing shaved his fore-head was drawn out in freer and brighter relief and looked more ex-pan-sive than it other-wise would this I will not ven-ture to de-cide but cer-tain it was his head was phreno-log-i-cal-ly an ex-cel-lent one It may seem ridicu-lous but it re-mind-ed me of Gen-er-al Wash-ing-tonâ s head as seen in the pop-u-lar busts of him It had the same long reg-u-lar-ly grad-ed re-treat-ing slope from above the brows which were like-wise very pro-ject-ing like two long promon-to-ries thick-ly wood-ed on top Quee-queg was Ge-orge Wash-ing-ton can-ni-bal-is-ti-cal-ly devel-oped Whilst I was thus close-ly scan-ning him half pre-tend-ing mean-while to be look-ing out at the storm from the case-ment he nev-er heed-ed my pres-ence nev-er trou-bled him-self with so much as a sin-gle glance but ap-peared whol-ly oc-cu-pied with count-ing the pages of the marvel-lous book Con-sid-er-ing how so-cia-bly we had been sleep-ing to-geth-er the night pre-vi-ous and espe-cial-ly con-sid-er-ing the af-fec-tion-ate arm I had found thrown over me upon wak-ing in the morn-ing I thought this in-dif-fer-ence of his very strange But sav-ages are strange be-ings at times you do not know ex-act-ly how to take them At first they are over-aw-ing their calm self col-lect-ed-ness of sim-plic-i-ty seems a So-crat-ic wis-dom I had no-ticed al-so that Quee-queg nev-er con-sort-ed at all or but very lit-tle with the other sea-men in the inn He made no ad-vances what-ev-er ap-peared to have no de-sire to en-large the cir-cle of his ac-quain-tances All this struck me as mighty sin-gu-lar yet upon se-cond thoughts there was some-thing al-most sublime in it Here was a man some twen-ty thou-sand miles from home by the way of Cape Horn that isâ which was the on-ly way he could get thereâ thrown among peo-ple as strange to him as though he were in the plan-et Jupiter and yet he seemed en-tire-ly at his ease pre-serv-ing the ut-most seren-i-ty con-tent with his own com-pan-ion-ship al-ways equal to him-self Sure-ly this was a touch of fine phi-los-o-phy though no doubt he had nev-er heard there was such a thing as that But per-haps to be true philoso-phers we mor-tals should not be con-scious of so liv-ing or so striv-ing So soon as I hear that such or such a man gives him-self out for a philoso-pher I con-clude that like the dyspep-tic old wo-man he must have â bro-ken his digester â As I sat there in that now lone-ly room the fire burn-ing low in that mild stage when after its first in-ten-si-ty has warmed the air it then on-ly glows to be looked at the even-ing shades and phan-toms gather-ing round the case-men-ts and peer-ing in upon us si-lent soli-tary twain the storm boom-ing without in solemn swells I be-gan to be sen-si-ble of strange feel-ings I felt a melt-ing in me No more my splin-tered heart and mad-dened hand were turned against the wolfish world This sooth-ing sav-age had redeemed it There he sat his very in-dif-fer-ence speak-ing a na-ture in which there lurked no civ-i-lized hypocrisies and bland de-ceits Wild he was a very sight of sights to see yet I be-gan to feel my-self mys-te-ri-ous-ly drawn towards him And those same things that would have re-pelled most others they were the very mag-nets that thus drew me Iâ ll try a pa-gan friend thought I since Chris-tian kind-ness has proved but hol-low cour-tesy I drew my bench near him and made some friend-ly signs and hin-ts do-ing my best to talk with him mean-while At first he lit-tle no-ticed th-ese ad-vances but present-ly upon my re-fer-ring to his last nightâ s hospi-tal-i-ties he made out to ask me whether we were again to be bed-fel-lows I told him yes where-at I thought he looked pleased per-haps a lit-tle com-pli-ment-ed We then turned over the book to-geth-er and I en-deav-ored to ex-plain to him the pur-pose of the print-ing and the mean-ing of the few pic-tures that were in it Thus I soon en-gaged his in-ter-est and from that we went to jab-ber-ing the best we could about the var-i-ous outer sights to be seen in this fa-mous town Soon I pro-posed a so-cial smoke and pro-duc-ing his pouch and tom-a-hawk he qui-et-ly of-fered me a puff And then we sat ex-chang-ing puffs from that wild pipe of his and keep-ing it reg-u-lar-ly pass-ing between us If there yet lurked any ice of in-dif-fer-ence towards me in the Pa-ganâ s breast this pleas-ant ge-nial smoke we had soon thawed it out and left us cronies He seemed to take to me quite as nat-u-ral-ly and un-bid-den-ly as I to him and when our smoke was over he pressed his fore-head against mine clasped me round the waist and said that hence-forth we were mar-ried mean-ing in his coun-tryâ s phrase that we were bo-som friends he would glad-ly die for me if need should be In a coun-try-man this sud-den flame of friend-ship would have seemed far too pre-ma-ture a thing to be much distrust-ed but in this sim-ple sav-age those old rules would not ap-ply After sup-per and another so-cial chat and smoke we went to our room to-geth-er He made me a pre-sent of his em-balmed head took out his enor-mous tobac-co wal-let and grop-ing un-der the tobac-co drew out some thir-ty dol-lars in sil-ver then spread-ing them on the table and me-chan-i-cal-ly di-vid-ing them in-to two equal por-tions pushed one of them towards me and said it was mine I was go-ing to re-mon-strate but he si-lenced me by pour-ing them in-to my trowser-sâ pock-ets I let them stay He then went about his even-ing pray-ers took out his idol and re-moved the paper fire-board By cer-tain signs and symp-toms I thought he seemed anx-ious for me to join him but well know-ing what was to fol-low I de-lib-er-at-ed a mo-ment whether in case he in-vit-ed me I would com-ply or other-wise I was a good Chris-tian born and bred in the bo-som of the in-fal-li-ble Pres-by-te-ri-an Church How then could I unite with this wild idola-tor in wor-ship-ping his piece of wood But what is wor-ship thought I Do you sup-pose now Ish-mael that the mag-nan-i-mous God of heav-en and earthâ pa-gans and all in-clud-edâ can pos-si-bly be jeal-ous of an in-signif-i-cant bit of black wood Im-pos-si-ble But what is wor-ship â to do the will of Godâ that is wor-ship And what is the will of God â to do to my fel-low man what I would have my fel-low man to do to meâ that is the will of God Now Quee-queg is my fel-low man And what do I wish that this Quee-queg would do to me Why unite with me in my par-tic-u-lar Pres-by-te-ri-an form of wor-ship Con-se-quent-ly I must then unite with him in his er-go I must turn idola-tor So I kin-dled the shav-ings helped prop up the in-no-cent lit-tle idol of-fered him burnt bis-cuit with Quee-queg salamed be-fore him twice or thrice kissed his nose and that done we un-dressed and went to bed at peace with our own con-sciences and all the world But we did not go to sleep without some lit-tle chat How it is I know not but there is no place like a bed for con-fi-den-tial dis-clo-sures between friends Man and wife they say there open the very bot-tom of their souls to each other and some old cou-ples often lie and chat over old times till near-ly morn-ing Thus then in our heart-sâ honey-moon lay I and Quee-quegâ a cosy lov-ing pair CHAPTER 11 Night-gown We had lain thus in bed chat-ting and nap-ping at short in-ter-vals and Quee-queg now and then af-fec-tion-ate-ly throw-ing his brown tat-tooed legs over mine and then draw-ing them back so en-tire-ly so-cia-ble and free and easy were we when at last by rea-son of our con-fab-u-la-tions what lit-tle nap-pish-ness re-mained in us al-to-geth-er depart-ed and we felt like get-ting up again though day break was yet some way down the fu-ture Yes we be-came very wake-ful so much so that our re-cum-bent po-si-tion be-gan to grow weari-some and by lit-tle and lit-tle we found our-selves sit-ting up the clothes well tucked around us lean-ing against the head board with our four knees drawn up close to-geth-er and our two nos-es bend-ing over them as if our kneep-ans were warm-ing pans We felt very nice and snug the more so since it was so chilly out of doors in-deed out of bed clothes too see-ing that there was no fire in the room The more so I say be-cause tru-ly to en-joy bodi-ly warmth some small part of you must be cold for there is no qual-i-ty in this world that is not what it is mere-ly by con-trast Noth-ing ex-ists in it-self If you flat-ter your-self that you are all over com-fort-able and have been so a long time then you can-not be said to be com-fort-able any more But if like Quee-queg and me in the bed the tip of your nose or the crown of your head be slight-ly chilled why then in-deed in the gen-er-al con-scious-ness you feel most de-light-ful-ly and un-mis-tak-ably warm For this rea-son a sleep-ing apart-ment should nev-er be fur-nished with a fire which is one of the lux-u-ri-ous dis-com-forts of the rich For the height of this sort of de-li-cious-ness is to have noth-ing but the blan-ket between you and your snug-ness and the cold of the outer air Then there you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arc-tic crys-tal We had been sit-ting in this crouch-ing man-ner for some time when all at once I thought I would open my eyes for when between sheets whether by day or by night and whether asleep or awake I have a way of al-ways keep-ing my eyes shut in order the more to con-cen-trate the snug-ness of be-ing in bed Be-cause no man can ever feel his own iden-ti-ty aright ex-cept his eyes be closed as if dark-ness were in-deed the prop-er ele-ment of our essences though light be more con-ge-nial to our clayey part Upon open-ing my eyes then and com-ing out of my own pleas-ant and self creat-ed dark-ness in-to the im-posed and coarse outer gloom of the unil-lu-mi-nat-ed twelve oâ clock at night I ex-pe-ri-enced a dis-agree-able re-vul-sion Nor did I at all ob-ject to the hint from Quee-queg that per-haps it were best to strike a light see-ing that we were so wide awake and be-sides he felt a strong de-sire to have a few qui-et puffs from his Tom-a-hawk Be it said that though I had felt such a strong repug-nance to his smok-ing in the bed the night be-fore yet see how elas-tic our stiff prej-u-dices grow when love once comes to bend them For now I liked noth-ing bet-ter than to have Quee-queg smok-ing by me even in bed be-cause he seemed to be full of such serene house-hold joy then I no more felt un-du-ly con-cerned for the land-lordâ s pol-i-cy of in-surance I was on-ly alive to the con-densed con-fi-den-tial com-fort-able-ness of shar-ing a pipe and a blan-ket with a real friend With our shag-gy jack-ets drawn about our shoul-ders we now passed the Tom-a-hawk from one to the other till slow-ly there grew over us a blue hang-ing tester of smoke il-lu-mi-nat-ed by the flame of the new lit lamp Whether it was that this un-du-lat-ing tester rolled the sav-age away to far dis-tant scenes I know not but he now spoke of his na-tive is-land and eager to hear his his-to-ry I begged him to go on and tell it He glad-ly com-plied Though at the time I but ill com-pre-hend-ed not a few of his words yet sub-se-quent dis-clo-sures when I had be-come more fa-mil-iar with his bro-ken phrase-ol-o-gy now en-able me to pre-sent the whole sto-ry such as it may prove in the mere skele-ton I give CHAPTER 12 Bio-graph-i-cal Quee-queg was a na-tive of Roko-voko an is-land far away to the West and South It is not down in any map true places nev-er are When a new hatched sav-age run-ning wild about his na-tive wood-lands in a grass clout fol-lowed by the nib-bling goats as if he were a green sapling even then in Quee-quegâ s am-bi-tious soul lurked a strong de-sire to see some-thing more of Chris-ten-dom than a spec-i-men whaler or two His father was a High Chief a King his un-cle a High Pri-est and on the ma-ter-nal side he boast-ed aun-ts who were the wives of un-con-quer-able war-riors There was ex-cel-lent blood in his vein-sâ roy-al stuff though sad-ly vi-ti-at-ed I fear by the can-ni-bal propen-si-ty he nour-ished in his un-tu-tored youth A Sag Har-bor ship visit-ed his fatherâ s bay and Quee-queg sought a pas-sage to Chris-tian lands But the ship hav-ing her full com-ple-ment of sea-men spurned his suit and not all the King his fatherâ s in-flu-ence could pre-vail But Quee-queg vowed a vow Alone in his ca-noe he pad-dled off to a dis-tant strait which he knew the ship must pass through when she quit-ted the is-land On one side was a co-ral reef on the other a low tongue of land covered with man-grove thick-ets that grew out in-to the water Hid-ing his ca-noe still afloat among th-ese thick-ets with its prow seaward he sat down in the stern pad-dle low in hand and when the ship was glid-ing by like a flash he dart-ed out gained her side with one back-ward dash of his foot cap-sized and sank his ca-noe climbed up the chains and throw-ing him-self at full length upon the deck grap-pled a ring bolt there and swore not to let it go though hacked in pieces In vain the cap-tain threat-ened to throw him over-board sus-pend-ed a cut-lass over his naked wrists Quee-queg was the son of a King and Quee-queg budged not Struck by his des-per-ate daunt-less-ness and his wild de-sire to visit Chris-ten-dom the cap-tain at last re-lent-ed and told him he might make him-self at home But this fine young sav-ageâ this sea Prince of Wales nev-er saw the Cap-tainâ s cabin They put him down among the sailors and made a whale-man of him But like Czar Peter con-tent to toil in the ship-yards of for-eign ci-ties Quee-queg dis-dained no seem-ing ig-nominy if there-by he might hap-pi-ly gain the pow-er of en-light-en-ing his un-tu-tored coun-try-men For at bot-tomâ so he told meâ he was ac-tu-at-ed by a pro-found de-sire to learn among the Chris-tians the arts where-by to make his peo-ple still hap-pi-er than they were and more than that still bet-ter than they were But alas the prac-tices of whale-men soon con-vinced him that even Chris-tians could be both mis-er-able and wicked in-finite-ly more so than all his fatherâ s hea-thens Ar-rived at last in old Sag Har-bor and see-ing what the sailors did there and then go-ing on to Nan-tuck-et and see-ing how they spent their wages in that place al-so poor Quee-queg gave it up for lost Thought he itâ s a wicked world in all merid-i-ans Iâ ll die a pa-gan And thus an old idola-tor at heart he yet lived among th-ese Chris-tians wore their clothes and tried to talk their gib-ber-ish Hence the queer ways about him though now some time from home By hin-ts I asked him whether he did not pro-pose go-ing back and hav-ing a corona-tion since he might now con-sid-er his father dead and gone he be-ing very old and fee-ble at the last ac-coun-ts He an-swered no not yet and added that he was fear-ful Chris-tian-i-ty or rather Chris-tians had un-fit-ted him for as-cend-ing the pure and un-de-filed throne of thir-ty pa-gan Kings be-fore him But by and by he said he would re-turn â as soon as he felt him-self bap-tized again For the nonce how-ev-er he pro-posed to sail about and sow his wild oats in all four oceans They had made a har-pooneer of him and that barbed iron was in lieu of a scep-tre now I asked him what might be his im-me-di-ate pur-pose touch-ing his fu-ture move-men-ts He an-swered to go to sea again in his old vo-ca-tion Upon this I told him that whal-ing was my own de-sign and in-formed him of my in-ten-tion to sail out of Nan-tuck-et as be-ing the most promis-ing port for an ad-ven-tur-ous whale-man to em-bark from He at once re-solved to ac-com-pa-ny me to that is-land ship aboard the same ves-sel get in-to the same watch the same boat the same mess with me in short to share my every hap with both my hands in his bold-ly dip in-to the Potluck of both worlds To all this I joy-ous-ly assent-ed for be-sides the af-fec-tion I now felt for Quee-queg he was an ex-pe-ri-enced har-pooneer and as such could not fail to be of great use-ful-ness to one who like me was whol-ly ig-no-rant of the mys-ter-ies of whal-ing though well ac-quaint-ed with the sea as known to mer-chant sea-men His sto-ry be-ing end-ed with his pipeâ s last dy-ing puff Quee-queg em-braced me pressed his fore-head against mine and blow-ing out the light we rolled over from each other this way and that and very soon were sleep-ing CHAPTER 13 Wheel-bar-row Next morn-ing Mon-day after dis-pos-ing of the em-balmed head to a bar-ber for a block I set-tled my own and com-radeâ s bill us-ing how-ev-er my com-radeâ s money The grin-ning land-lord as well as the board-ers seemed amaz-ing-ly tick-led at the sud-den friend-ship which had sprung up between me and Quee-quegâ espe-cial-ly as Peter Coffinâ s cock and bull sto-ries about him had pre-vi-ous-ly so much alarmed me con-cern-ing the very per-son whom I now com-panied with We bor-rowed a wheel-bar-row and em-bark-ing our things in-clud-ing my own poor car-pet bag and Quee-quegâ s can-vas sack and ham-mock away we went down to â the Moss â the lit-tle Nan-tuck-et pack-et schooner moored at the wharf As we were go-ing along the peo-ple stared not at Quee-queg so muchâ for they were used to see-ing can-ni-bals like him in their streets â but at see-ing him and me upon such con-fi-den-tial ter-ms But we heed-ed them not go-ing along wheel-ing the bar-row by turns and Quee-queg now and then stop-ping to ad-just the sheath on his har-poon bar-bs I asked him why he car-ried such a trou-ble-some thing with him ashore and whether all whal-ing ships did not find their own har-poons To this in sub-stance he replied that though what I hint-ed was true enough yet he had a par-tic-u-lar af-fec-tion for his own har-poon be-cause it was of as-sured stuff well tried in many a mor-tal com-bat and deeply in-ti-mate with the hearts of whales In short like many in-land reapers and mow-ers who go in-to the farm-er-sâ mead-ows armed with their own scythesâ though in no wise obliged to fur-nish themâ even so Quee-queg for his own pri-vate rea-sons pre-ferred his own har-poon Shift-ing the bar-row from my hand to his he told me a fun-ny sto-ry about the first wheel-bar-row he had ever seen It was in Sag Har-bor The own-ers of his ship it seems had lent him one in which to car-ry his heavy ch-est to his board-ing house Not to seem ig-no-rant about the thingâ though in truth he was en-tire-ly so con-cern-ing the pre-cise way in which to man-age the bar-rowâ Quee-queg puts his ch-est upon it lash-es it fast and then shoul-ders the bar-row and march-es up the wharf â Why â said I â Quee-queg you might have known bet-ter than that one would think Did-nâ t the peo-ple laugh â Upon this he told me another sto-ry The peo-ple of his is-land of Roko-voko it seems at their wed-ding feasts ex-press the fra-grant water of young co-coanuts in-to a large stained cal-abash like a punch-bowl and this punch-bowl al-ways for-ms the great cen-tral or-na-ment on the braid-ed mat where the feast is held Now a cer-tain grand mer-chant ship once touched at Roko-voko and its com-man-derâ from all ac-coun-ts a very state-ly punc-til-ious gentle-man at least for a sea cap-tainâ this com-man-der was in-vit-ed to the wed-ding feast of Quee-quegâ s sis-ter a pret-ty young princess just turned of ten Well when all the wed-ding guests were assem-bled at the brideâ s bam-boo cot-tage this Cap-tain march-es in and be-ing as-signed the post of honor placed him-self over against the punch-bowl and between the High Pri-est and his majesty the King Quee-quegâ s father Grace be-ing said â for those peo-ple have their grace as well as weâ though Quee-queg told me that un-like us who at such times look down-wards to our plat-ters they on the con-trary copy-ing the ducks glance up-wards to the great Giv-er of all feast-sâ Grace I say be-ing said the High Pri-est opens the ban-quet by the im-memo-ri-al cer-e-mo-ny of the is-land that is dip-ping his con-se-crat-ed and con-se-crat-ing fingers in-to the bowl be-fore the blessed bev-er-age cir-cu-lates See-ing him-self placed next the Pri-est and not-ing the cer-e-mo-ny and think-ing him-selfâ be-ing Cap-tain of a shipâ as hav-ing plain prece-dence over a mere is-land King espe-cial-ly in the Kingâ s own houseâ the Cap-tain cool-ly pro-ceeds to wash his hands in the punch-bowl â tak-ing it I sup-pose for a huge finger glass â Now â said Quee-queg â what you tink now â Did-nâ t our peo-ple laugh â At last pas-sage paid and lug-gage safe we stood on board the schooner Hoist-ing sail it glid-ed down the Acush-net riv-er On one side New Bed-ford rose in ter-races of streets their ice covered trees all glit-ter-ing in the clear cold air Huge hil-ls and moun-tains of casks on casks were piled upon her wharves and side by side the world wan-der-ing whale ships lay si-lent and safe-ly moored at last while from others came a sound of car-pen-ters and coop-ers with blend-ed nois-es of fires and forges to melt the pitch all be-to-ken-ing that new cruis-es were on the start that one most per-ilous and long voy-age end-ed on-ly be-gins a se-cond and a se-cond end-ed on-ly be-gins a third and so on for ever and for aye Such is the end-less-ness yea the in-tol-er-a-ble-ness of all earth-ly ef-fort Gain-ing the more open water the brac-ing breeze waxed fresh the lit-tle Moss tossed the quick foam from her bows as a young colt his snort-ings How I snuffed that Tar-tar air â how I spurned that turn-pike earth â that com-mon high-way all over dent-ed with the marks of slav-ish heels and hoofs and turned me to ad-mire the mag-na-nim-i-ty of the sea which will per-mit no records At the same foam foun-tain Quee-queg seemed to drink and reel with me His dusky nostrils swelled apart he showed his filed and point-ed teeth On on we flew and our off-ing gained the Moss did ho-mage to the blast ducked and dived her bows as a slave be-fore the Sul-tan Side-ways lean-ing we side-ways dart-ed every rope-yarn tin-gling like a wire the two tall masts buck-ling like In-di-an canes in land tor-na-does So full of this reel-ing scene were we as we stood by the plung-ing bowsprit that for some time we did not no-tice the jeer-ing glances of the pas-sen-gers a lub-ber like assem-bly who marvelled that two fel-low be-ings should be so com-pan-ion-able as though a white man were any-thing more dig-ni-fied than a white-washed ne-gro But there were some boo-bies and bump-kins there who by their in-tense green-ness must have come from the heart and cen-tre of all ver-dure Quee-queg caught one of th-ese young saplings mim-ick-ing him be-hind his back I thought the bump-kinâ s hour of doom was come Drop-ping his har-poon the brawny sav-age caught him in his ar-ms and by an al-most mirac-u-lous dex-ter-i-ty and strength sent him high up bodi-ly in-to the air then slight-ly tap-ping his stern in mid som-er-set the fel-low land-ed with burst-ing lungs upon his feet while Quee-queg turn-ing his back upon him light-ed his tom-a-hawk pipe and passed it to me for a puff â Capt-ing Capt-ing â yelled the bump-kin run-ning towards that of-fi-cer â Capt-ing Capt-ing hereâ s the devil â â Hal-lo you sir â cried the Cap-tain a gaunt rib of the sea stalk-ing up to Quee-queg â what in thun-der do you mean by that Donâ t you know you might have killed that chap â â What him say â said Quee-queg as he mild-ly turned to me â He say â said I â that you came near kill e that man there â point-ing to the still shiver-ing green-horn â Kill e â cried Quee-queg twist-ing his tat-tooed face in-to an un-earth-ly ex-pres-sion of dis-dain â ah him bevy small e fish e Quee-queg no kill e so small e fish e Quee-queg kill e big whale â â Look you â roared the Cap-tain â Iâ ll kill e you you can-ni-bal if you try any more of your tricks aboard here so mind your eye â But it so hap-pened just then that it was high time for the Cap-tain to mind his own eye The prodi-gious strain upon the main sail had part-ed the weather sheet and the tre-men-dous boom was now fly-ing from side to side com-plete-ly sweep-ing the en-tire after part of the deck The poor fel-low whom Quee-queg had han-dled so rough-ly was swept over-board all hands were in a pan-ic and to at-tempt snatch-ing at the boom to stay it seemed mad-ness It flew from right to left and back again al-most in one tick-ing of a watch and every in-stant seemed on the point of snap-ping in-to splin-ters Noth-ing was done and noth-ing seemed ca-pable of be-ing done those on deck rushed towards the bows and stood eye-ing the boom as if it were the low-er jaw of an ex-as-per-at-ed whale In the midst of this con-ster-na-tion Quee-queg dropped deft-ly to his knees and crawl-ing un-der the path of the boom whipped hold of a rope se-cured one end to the bul-warks and then fling-ing the other like a las-so caught it round the boom as it swept over his head and at the next jerk the spar was that way trapped and all was safe The schooner was run in-to the wind and while the hands were clear-ing away the stern boat Quee-queg stripped to the waist dart-ed from the side with a long liv-ing arc of a leap For three min-utes or more he was seen swim-ming like a dog throw-ing his long ar-ms straight out be-fore him and by turns re-veal-ing his brawny shoul-ders through the freez-ing foam I looked at the grand and glo-ri-ous fel-low but saw no one to be saved The green-horn had gone down Shoot-ing him-self per-pen-dic-u-lar-ly from the water Quee-queg now took an in-stan-tâ s glance around him and seem-ing to see just how mat-ters were dived down and dis-ap-peared A few min-utes more and he rose again one arm still strik-ing out and with the other drag-ging a life-less form The boat soon picked them up The poor bump-kin was re-stored All hands vot-ed Quee-queg a noble trump the cap-tain begged his par-don From that hour I clove to Quee-queg like a bar-na-cle yea till poor Quee-queg took his last long dive Was there ever such un-con-scious-ness He did not seem to think that he at all de-served a medal from the Hu-mane and Mag-nan-i-mous So-ci-eties He on-ly asked for waterâ fresh waterâ some-thing to wipe the brine off that done he put on dry clothes light-ed his pipe and lean-ing against the bul-warks and mild-ly eye-ing those around him seemed to be say-ing to him-selfâ â Itâ s a mu-tu-al joint stock world in all merid-i-ans We can-ni-bals must help th-ese Chris-tians â CHAPTER 14 Nan-tuck-et Noth-ing more hap-pened on the pas-sage wor-thy the men-tion-ing so after a fine run we safe-ly ar-rived in Nan-tuck-et Nan-tuck-et Take out your map and look at it See what a real corner of the world it oc-cu-pies how it stands there away off shore more lone-ly than the Ed-dy-s-tone light-house Look at itâ a mere hil-lock and el-bow of sand all beach without a back-ground There is more sand there than you would use in twen-ty years as a sub-sti-tute for blot-ting paper Some game-some wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there they donâ t grow nat-u-ral-ly that they im-port Cana-da this-tles that they have to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask that pieces of wood in Nan-tuck-et are car-ried about like bits of the true cross in Rome that peo-ple there plant toad-stools be-fore their hous-es to get un-der the shade in sum-mer time that one blade of grass makes an oa-sis three blades in a dayâ s walk a prair-ie that they wear quick-sand shoes some-thing like La-p-lan-der snow shoes that they are so shut up belt-ed about every way in-closed sur-round-ed and made an ut-ter is-land of by the ocean that to their very chairs and tables small clams will some-times be found ad-her-ing as to the backs of sea tur-tles But th-ese ex-trav-a-gan-zas on-ly show that Nan-tuck-et is no Illi-nois Look now at the won-drous tra-di-tion-al sto-ry of how this is-land was set-tled by the red men Thus goes the le-gend In olden times an ea-gle swooped down upon the New Eng-land coast and car-ried off an in-fant In-di-an in his talons With loud la-ment the par-en-ts saw their child borne out of sight over the wide waters They re-solved to fol-low in the same direc-tion Set-ting out in their ca-noes after a per-ilous pas-sage they dis-cov-ered the is-land and there they found an emp-ty ivory cas-ket â the poor lit-tle In-di-anâ s skele-ton What won-der then that th-ese Nan-tuck-eters born on a beach should take to the sea for a liveli-hood They first caught crabs and quo-hogs in the sand grown bold-er they wad-ed out with nets for mack-er-el more ex-pe-ri-enced they pushed off in boats and cap-tured cod and at last launch-ing a navy of great ships on the sea ex-plored this watery world put an inces-sant belt of cir-cum-nav-i-ga-tions round it peeped in at Behringâ s Straits and in all sea-sons and all oceans de-clared ever-last-ing war with the might-i-est an-i-mat-ed mass that has sur-vived the flood most mon-strous and most moun-tain-ous That Him-male-han salt sea Mastodon clothed with such por-ten-tous-ness of un-con-scious pow-er that his very pan-ics are more to be dread-ed than his most fear-less and ma-li-cious as-saults And thus have th-ese naked Nan-tuck-eters th-ese sea her-mits is-su-ing from their ant hill in the sea over-run and con-quered the watery world like so many Alexan-ders par-celling out among them the At-lantic Pa-cif-ic and In-di-an oceans as the three pi-rate pow-ers did Poland Let Amer-i-ca add Mex-i-co to Texas and pile Cu-ba upon Cana-da let the English over-swarm all In-dia and hang out their blaz-ing ban-ner from the sun two thirds of this ter-raque-ous globe are the Nan-tuck-eterâ s For the sea is his he owns it as Em-per-ors own em-pires other sea-men hav-ing but a right of way through it Mer-chant ships are but ex-ten-sion bridges armed ones but float-ing forts even pi-rates and pri-va-teers though fol-low-ing the sea as high-way-men the road they but plun-der other ships other frag-men-ts of the land like them-selves without seek-ing to draw their liv-ing from the bot-tom-less deep it-self The Nan-tuck-eter he alone re-sides and riots on the sea he alone in Bi-ble lan-guage goes down to it in ships to and fro plough-ing it as his own spe-cial plan-ta-tion There is his home there lies his busi-ness which a Noahâ s flood would not in-ter-rupt though it over-whelmed all the mil-lions in Chi-na He lives on the sea as prair-ie cocks in the prair-ie he hides among the waves he clim-bs them as chamois hun-ters climb the Alps For years he knows not the land so that when he comes to it at last it smel-ls like another world more strange-ly than the moon would to an Earths-man With the land-less gull that at sun-set folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between bil-lows so at night-fall the Nan-tuck-eter out of sight of land furls his sails and lays him to his rest while un-der his very pil-low rush herds of wal-rus-es and whales CHAPTER 15 Chow-der It was quite late in the even-ing when the lit-tle Moss came snug-ly to an-chor and Quee-queg and I went ashore so we could at-tend to no busi-ness that day at least none but a sup-per and a bed The land-lord of the Spouter Inn had rec-om-mend-ed us to his cousin Hosea Hussey of the Try Pots whom he assert-ed to be the pro-pri-etor of one of the best kept ho-tels in all Nan-tuck-et and more-over he had as-sured us that Cousin Hosea as he called him was fa-mous for his chow-ders In short he plain-ly hint-ed that we could not pos-si-bly do bet-ter than try pot luck at the Try Pots But the direc-tions he had giv-en us about keep-ing a yel-low ware-house on our star-board hand till we opened a white church to the lar-board and then keep-ing that on the lar-board hand till we made a corner three poin-ts to the star-board and that done then ask the first man we met where the place was th-ese crooked direc-tions of his very much puz-zled us at first espe-cial-ly as at the out-set Quee-queg in-sist-ed that the yel-low ware-houseâ our first point of depar-tureâ must be left on the lar-board hand where-as I had un-der-stood Peter Cof-fin to say it was on the star-board How-ev-er by dint of beat-ing about a lit-tle in the dark and now and then knock-ing up a peace-able in-hab-i-tant to in-quire the way we at last came to some-thing which there was no mis-tak-ing Two enor-mous wood-en pots paint-ed black and sus-pend-ed by ass-esâ ears swung from the cross trees of an old top mast plant-ed in front of an old door-way The horns of the cross trees were sawed off on the other side so that this old top mast looked not a lit-tle like a gal-lows Per-haps I was over sen-si-tive to such im-pres-sions at the time but I could not help star-ing at this gal-lows with a vague mis-giv-ing A sort of crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two re-main-ing horns yes two of them one for Quee-queg and one for me Itâ s omi-nous thinks I A Cof-fin my Innkeep-er upon land-ing in my first whal-ing port tomb-stones star-ing at me in the whale-menâ s chapel and here a gal-lows and a pair of prodi-gious black pots too Are th-ese last throw-ing out oblique hin-ts touch-ing Tophet I was called from th-ese re-flec-tions by the sight of a freck-led wo-man with yel-low hair and a yel-low gown stand-ing in the porch of the inn un-der a dull red lamp swing-ing there that looked much like an in-jured eye and car-ry-ing on a brisk scold-ing with a man in a pur-ple woollen shirt â Get along with ye â said she to the man â or Iâ ll be comb-ing ye â â Come on Quee-queg â said I â all right Thereâ s Mrs Hussey â And so it turned out Mr Hosea Hussey be-ing from home but leav-ing Mrs Hussey en-tire-ly com-pe-tent to at-tend to all his af-fairs Upon mak-ing known our de-sires for a sup-per and a bed Mrs Hussey post-pon-ing fur-ther scold-ing for the pre-sent ush-ered us in-to a lit-tle room and seat-ing us at a table spread with the relics of a re-cent-ly con-clud-ed repast turned round to us and saidâ â Clam or Cod â â Whatâ s that about Cods maâ am â said I with much po-lite-ness â Clam or Cod â she re-peat-ed â A clam for sup-per a cold clam is that what you mean Mrs Hussey â says I â but thatâ s a rather cold and clam-my re-cep-tion in the win-ter time ainâ t it Mrs Hussey â But be-ing in a great hur-ry to re-sume scold-ing the man in the pur-ple Shirt who was wait-ing for it in the en-try and seem-ing to hear noth-ing but the word â clam â Mrs Hussey hur-ried towards an open door lead-ing to the kitchen and bawl-ing out â clam for two â dis-ap-peared â Quee-queg â said I â do you think that we can make out a sup-per for us both on one clam â How-ev-er a warm sa-vory steam from the kitchen served to belie the ap-par-ent-ly cheer-less prospect be-fore us But when that smok-ing chow-der came in the mys-tery was de-light-ful-ly ex-plained Oh sweet friends hear-ken to me It was made of small juicy clams scarce-ly big-ger than hazel nuts mixed with pound-ed ship bis-cuit and salt-ed pork cut up in-to lit-tle flakes the whole en-riched with but-ter and plen-ti-ful-ly sea-soned with pep-per and salt Our ap-petites be-ing sharp-ened by the frosty voy-age and in par-tic-u-lar Quee-queg see-ing his favourite fish-ing food be-fore him and the chow-der be-ing sur-pass-ing-ly ex-cel-lent we des-patched it with great ex-pe-di-tion when lean-ing back a mo-ment and be-think-ing me of Mrs Husseyâ s clam and cod an-nounce-ment I thought I would try a lit-tle ex-per-i-ment Step-ping to the kitchen door I ut-tered the word â codâ with great em-pha-sis and re-sumed my seat In a few mo-men-ts the savoury steam came forth again but with a dif-fer-ent fla-vor and in good time a fine cod chow-der was placed be-fore us We re-sumed busi-ness and while ply-ing our spoons in the bowl thinks I to my-self I won-der now if this here has any ef-fect on the head Whatâ s that stul-ti-fy-ing say-ing about chow-der head-ed peo-ple â But look Quee-queg ainâ t that a live eel in your bowl Whereâ s your har-poon â Fishi-est of all fishy places was the Try Pots which well de-served its name for the pots there were al-ways boil-ing chow-ders Chow-der for break-fast and chow-der for din-ner and chow-der for sup-per till you be-gan to look for fish bones com-ing through your clothes The area be-fore the house was paved with clam shel-ls Mrs Hussey wore a pol-ished neck-lace of cod-fish ver-te-bra and Hosea Hussey had his ac-count books bound in su-pe-ri-or old shark skin There was a fishy fla-vor to the milk too which I could not at all ac-count for till one morn-ing hap-pen-ing to take a stroll along the beach among some fish-er-menâ s boats I saw Hoseaâ s brindled cow feed-ing on fish rem-nan-ts and march-ing along the sand with each foot in a codâ s de-cap-i-tat-ed head look-ing very slip shod I as-sure ye Sup-per con-clud-ed we re-ceived a lamp and direc-tions from Mrs Hussey con-cern-ing the near-est way to bed but as Quee-queg was about to pre-cede me up the stairs the lady reached forth her arm and de-mand-ed his har-poon she al-lowed no har-poon in her cham-bers â Why not â said I â every true whale-man sleeps with his har-poonâ but why not â â Be-cause itâ s danger-ous â says she â Ever since young Stig-gs com-ing from that un-fortâ nt vâ yâ ge of his when he was gone four years and a half with on-ly three bar-rels of ile was found dead in my first floor back with his har-poon in his side ever since then I al-low no board-ers to take sich danger-ous weep-ons in their rooms at night So Mr Quee-quegâ for she had learned his name â I will just take this here iron and keep it for you till morn-ing But the chow-der clam or cod to mor-row for break-fast men â â Both â says I â and letâ s have a cou-ple of smoked her-ring by way of va-ri-ety â CHAPTER 16 The Ship In bed we con-coct-ed our plans for the mor-row But to my sur-prise and no small con-cern Quee-queg now gave me to un-der-stand that he had been dili-gent-ly con-sult-ing Yo-joâ the name of his black lit-tle godâ and Yo-jo had told him two or three times over and strong-ly in-sist-ed upon it every-way that in-stead of our go-ing to-geth-er among the whal-ing fleet in har-bor and in con-cert select-ing our craft in-stead of this I say Yo-jo earnest-ly en-joined that the selec-tion of the ship should rest whol-ly with me inas-much as Yo-jo pur-posed be-friend-ing us and in order to do so had al-ready pitched upon a ves-sel which if left to my-self I Ish-mael should in-fal-li-bly light upon for all the world as though it had turned out by chance and in that ves-sel I must im-me-di-ate-ly ship my-self for the pre-sent ir-re-spec-tive of Quee-queg I have for-got-ten to men-tion that in many things Quee-queg placed great con-fi-dence in the ex-cel-lence of Yo-joâ s judg-ment and sur-pris-ing fore-cast of things and cher-ished Yo-jo with con-sid-er-able es-teem as a rather good sort of god who per-haps meant well enough upon the whole but in all cas-es did not suc-ceed in his benev-o-lent de-signs Now this plan of Quee-quegâ s or rather Yo-joâ s touch-ing the selec-tion of our craft I did not like that plan at all I had not a lit-tle relied upon Quee-quegâ s sa-gac-i-ty to point out the whaler best fit-ted to car-ry us and our for-tunes se-cure-ly But as all my re-mon-strances pro-duced no ef-fect upon Quee-queg I was obliged to ac-qui-esce and ac-cord-ing-ly pre-pared to set about this busi-ness with a deter-mined rush-ing sort of en-er-gy and vig-or that should quick-ly set-tle that tri-fling lit-tle af-fair Next morn-ing ear-ly leav-ing Quee-queg shut up with Yo-jo in our lit-tle be-d-roomâ for it seemed that it was some sort of Lent or Ra-madan or day of fast-ing hu-mil-i-a-tion and pray-er with Quee-queg and Yo-jo that day how it was I nev-er could find out for though I ap-plied my-self to it sev-er-al times I nev-er could master his li-tur-gies and XXXIX Ar-ti-clesâ leav-ing Quee-queg then fast-ing on his tom-a-hawk pipe and Yo-jo warm-ing him-self at his sacri-fi-cial fire of shav-ings I sal-lied out among the ship-ping After much pro-longed saun-ter-ing and many ran-dom in-quiries I learnt that there were three ships up for three yearsâ voy-agesâ The Devil dam the Tit bit and the Pe-quod Devil Dam I do not know the ori-gin of Tit bit is ob-vi-ous Pe-quod you will no doubt re-mem-ber was the name of a cel-e-brat-ed tribe of Mas-sachuset-ts In-di-ans now ex-tinct as the an-cient Medes I peered and pryed about the Devil dam from her hopped over to the Tit bit and fi-nal-ly go-ing on board the Pe-quod looked around her for a mo-ment and then de-cid-ed that this was the very ship for us You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day for aught I know â square toed lug-gers moun-tain-ous Ja-panese junks but-ter box gal-liots and what not but take my word for it you nev-er saw such a rare old craft as this same rare old Pe-quod She was a ship of the old school rather small if any-thing with an old fash-ioned claw foot-ed look about her Long sea-soned and weather stained in the typhoons and calms of all four oceans her old hul-lâ s com-plex-ion was darkened like a French gre-nadierâ s who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia Her ven-er-a-ble bows looked beard-ed Her mast-sâ cut some-where on the coast of Ja-pan where her orig-i-nal ones were lost over-board in a galeâ her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of Cologne Her an-cient decks were worn and wrin-kled like the pil-grim wor-shipped flag stone in Can-ter-bury Cathe-dral where Beck-et bled But to all th-ese her old an-tiq-ui-ties were added new and marvel-lous fea-tures per-tain-ing to the wild busi-ness that for more than half a cen-tu-ry she had fol-lowed Old Cap-tain Pe-leg many years her chief mate be-fore he com-mand-ed another ves-sel of his own and now a re-tired sea-man and one of the prin-ci-pal own-ers of the Pe-quod â this old Pe-leg dur-ing the term of his chief mate-ship had built upon her orig-i-nal grotesque-ness and in-laid it all over with a quaint-ness both of ma-te-ri-al and de-vice un-matched by any-thing ex-cept it be Thorkill Hakeâ s carved buck-ler or bed-stead She was ap-par-elled like any bar-bar-ic Ethiopi-an em-per-or his neck heavy with pen-dan-ts of pol-ished ivory She was a thing of tro-phies A can-ni-bal of a craft trick-ing her-self forth in the chased bones of her ene-mies All round her un-pan-elled open bul-warks were gar-nished like one con-tin-u-ous jaw with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale insert-ed there for pins to fas-ten her old hem-pen thews and ten-dons to Those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood but deft-ly trav-elled over sheaves of sea ivory Scorn-ing a turn-stile wheel at her rev-erend helm she sport-ed there a tiller and that tiller was in one mass cu-ri-ous-ly carved from the long nar-row low-er jaw of her hered-i-tary foe The helms-man who steered by that tiller in a tem-pest felt like the Tar-tar when he holds back his fiery steed by clutch-ing its jaw A noble craft but some-how a most me-lan-choly All noble things are touched with that Now when I looked about the quar-ter deck for some one hav-ing author-i-ty in order to pro-pose my-self as a can-di-date for the voy-age at first I saw no-body but I could not well over-look a strange sort of tent or rather wig-wam pitched a lit-tle be-hind the main mast It seemed on-ly a tem-po-rary erec-tion used in port It was of a con-i-cal shape some ten feet high con-sist-ing of the long huge slabs of lim-ber black bone tak-en from the mid-dle and high-est part of the jaws of the right whale Plant-ed with their broad ends on the deck a cir-cle of th-ese slabs laced to-geth-er mu-tu-al-ly sloped towards each other and at the apex unit-ed in a tuft-ed point where the loose hairy fi-bres waved to and fro like the top knot on some old Pot-towot-tamie Sachemâ s head A tri-an-gu-lar open-ing faced towards the bows of the ship so that the in-sid-er com-mand-ed a com-plete view for-ward And half con-cealed in this queer ten-e-ment I at length found one who by his aspect seemed to have author-i-ty and who it be-ing noon and the shipâ s work sus-pend-ed was now en-joy-ing re-spite from the bur-den of com-mand He was seat-ed on an old fash-ioned oak-en chair wrig-gling all over with cu-ri-ous carv-ing and the bot-tom of which was formed of a stout in-ter-lac-ing of the same elas-tic stuff of which the wig-wam was con-struct-ed There was noth-ing so very par-tic-u-lar per-haps about the ap-pear-ance of the elder-ly man I saw he was brown and brawny like most old sea-men and heav-i-ly rolled up in blue pilot cloth cut in the Quak-er style on-ly there was a fine and al-most mi-cro-scop-ic net work of the min-utest wrin-kles in-ter-lac-ing round his eyes which must have arisen from his con-tin-u-al sail-ings in many hard gales and al-ways look-ing to wind-ward â for this caus-es the mus-cles about the eyes to be-come pursed to-geth-er Such eye wrin-kles are very ef-fec-tu-al in a scowl â Is this the Cap-tain of the Pe-quod â said I ad-vanc-ing to the door of the tent â Sup-pos-ing it be the cap-tain of the Pe-quod what dost thou want of him â he de-mand-ed â I was think-ing of ship-ping â â Thou wast wast thou I see thou art no Nan-tuck-eterâ ever been in a stove boat â â No Sir I nev-er have â â Dost know noth-ing at all about whal-ing I dare sayâ eh â Noth-ing Sir but I have no doubt I shall soon learn Iâ ve been sev-er-al voy-ages in the mer-chant ser-vice and I think thatâ â â Mer-chant ser-vice be damned Talk not that lin-go to me Dost see that leg â Iâ ll take that leg away from thy stern if ever thou talk-est of the marchant ser-vice to me again Marchant ser-vice in-deed I sup-pose now ye feel con-sid-er-able proud of hav-ing served in those marchant ships But flukes man what makes thee want to go a whal-ing eh â it looks a lit-tle sus-pi-cious donâ t it eh â Hast not been a pi-rate hast thou â Didst not rob thy last Cap-tain didst thou â Dost not think of mur-der-ing the of-fi-cers when thou gettest to sea â I protest-ed my in-no-cence of th-ese things I saw that un-der the mask of th-ese half hu-mor-ous in-nu-en-does this old sea-man as an in-su-lat-ed Quak-er-ish Nan-tuck-eter was full of his in-su-lar prej-u-dices and rather distrust-ful of all aliens un-less they hailed from Cape Cod or the Vine-yard â But what takes thee a whal-ing I want to know that be-fore I think of ship-ping ye â â Well sir I want to see what whal-ing is I want to see the world â â Want to see what whal-ing is eh Have ye clapped eye on Cap-tain Ahab â â Who is Cap-tain Ahab sir â â Aye aye I thought so Cap-tain Ahab is the Cap-tain of this ship â â I am mis-tak-en then I thought I was speak-ing to the Cap-tain him-self â â Thou art speak-ing to Cap-tain Pelegâ thatâ s who ye are speak-ing to young man It be-longs to me and Cap-tain Bil-dad to see the Pe-quod fit-ted out for the voy-age and sup-plied with all her needs in-clud-ing crew We are part own-ers and agen-ts But as I was go-ing to say if thou wan-test to know what whal-ing is as thou tellest ye do I can put ye in a way of find-ing it out be-fore ye bind your-self to it past back-ing out Clap eye on Cap-tain Ahab young man and thou wilt find that he has on-ly one leg â â What do you mean sir Was the other one lost by a whale â â Lost by a whale Young man come nearer to me it was devoured chewed up crunched by the mon-strous-est par-ma-cetty that ever chipped a boat â ah ah â I was a lit-tle alarmed by his en-er-gy per-haps al-so a lit-tle touched at the hearty grief in his con-clud-ing ex-cla-ma-tion but said as calm-ly as I could â What you say is no doubt true enough sir but how could I know there was any pe-cu-liar fe-roc-i-ty in that par-tic-u-lar whale though in-deed I might have in-ferred as much from the sim-ple fact of the ac-ci-dent â â Look ye now young man thy lungs are a sort of soft dâ ye see thou dost not talk shark a bit Sure yeâ ve been to sea be-fore now sure of that â â Sir â said I â I thought I told you that I had been four voy-ages in the mer-chan-tâ â â Hard down out of that Mind what I said about the marchant ser-viceâ donâ t ag-gra-vate meâ I wonâ t have it But let us un-der-stand each other I have giv-en thee a hint about what whal-ing is do ye yet feel in-clined for it â â I do sir â â Very good Now art thou the man to pitch a har-poon down a live whaleâ s throat and then jump after it An-swer quick â â I am sir if it should be pos-i-tive-ly indis-pens-able to do so not to be got rid of that is which I donâ t take to be the fact â â Good again Now then thou not on-ly wan-test to go a whal-ing to find out by ex-pe-ri-ence what whal-ing is but ye al-so want to go in order to see the world Was not that what ye said I thought so Well then just step for-ward there and take a peep over the weather bow and then back to me and tell me what ye see there â For a mo-ment I stood a lit-tle puz-zled by this cu-ri-ous re-quest not know-ing ex-act-ly how to take it whether hu-mor-ous-ly or in earnest But con-cen-trat-ing all his crowâ s feet in-to one scowl Cap-tain Pe-leg start-ed me on the er-rand Go-ing for-ward and glanc-ing over the weather bow I per-ceived that the ship swing-ing to her an-chor with the flood tide was now oblique-ly point-ing towards the open ocean The prospect was un-lim-it-ed but ex-ceed-ing-ly monotonous and for-bid-ding not the slight-est va-ri-ety that I could see â Well whatâ s the re-port â said Pe-leg when I came back â what did ye see â â Not much â I repliedâ â noth-ing but water con-sid-er-able hori-zon though and thereâ s a squall com-ing up I think â â Well what does thou think then of see-ing the world Do ye wish to go round Cape Horn to see any more of it eh Canâ t ye see the world where you stand â I was a lit-tle stag-gered but go a whal-ing I must and I would and the Pe-quod was as good a ship as anyâ I thought the bestâ and all this I now re-peat-ed to Pe-leg See-ing me so deter-mined he ex-pressed his willing-ness to ship me â And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off â he addedâ â come along with ye â And so say-ing he led the way below deck in-to the cabin Seat-ed on the tran-som was what seemed to me a most un-com-mon and sur-pris-ing fig-ure It turned out to be Cap-tain Bil-dad who along with Cap-tain Pe-leg was one of the largest own-ers of the ves-sel the other shares as is some-times the case in th-ese ports be-ing held by a crowd of old an-nu-i-tan-ts wi-d-ows father-less chil-dren and chancery wards each own-ing about the value of a tim-ber head or a foot of plank or a nail or two in the ship Peo-ple in Nan-tuck-et in-vest their money in whal-ing ves-sels the same way that you do yours in ap-proved state stocks bring-ing in good in-ter-est Now Bil-dad like Pe-leg and in-deed many other Nan-tuck-eters was a Quak-er the is-land hav-ing been orig-i-nal-ly set-tled by that sect and to this day its in-hab-i-tan-ts in gen-er-al re-tain in an un-com-mon mea-sure the pe-cu-liar-i-ties of the Quak-er on-ly var-i-ous-ly and ano-ma-lous-ly mod-i-fied by things al-to-geth-er alien and hetero-ge-neous For some of th-ese same Quak-ers are the most san-guinary of all sailors and whale hun-ters They are fight-ing Quak-ers they are Quak-ers with a vengeance So that there are in-stances among them of men who named with Scrip-ture namesâ a sin-gu-lar-ly com-mon fash-ion on the is-landâ and in child-hood nat-u-ral-ly im-bib-ing the state-ly dra-mat-ic thee and thou of the Quak-er idiom still from the au-da-cious dar-ing and bound-less ad-ven-ture of their sub-se-quent lives strange-ly blend with th-ese unout-grown pe-cu-liar-i-ties a thou-sand bold dash-es of char-ac-ter not un-wor-thy a Scan-di-na-vian sea king or a poet-i-cal Pa-gan Ro-man And when th-ese things unite in a man of great-ly su-pe-ri-or nat-u-ral force with a glob-u-lar brain and a pon-der-ous heart who has al-so by the still-ness and seclu-sion of many long night watch-es in the re-motest waters and be-neath con-stel-la-tions nev-er seen here at the north been led to think un-tra-di-tion-al-ly and in-de-pen-dent-ly re-ceiv-ing all na-tureâ s sweet or sav-age im-pres-sions fresh from her own vir-gin vol-un-tary and con-fid-ing breast and there-by chiefly but with some help from ac-ci-den-tal ad-van-tages to learn a bold and ner-vous lofty lan-guageâ that man makes one in a whole na-tionâ s cen-susâ a mighty pageant crea-ture formed for noble tragedies Nor will it at all de-tract from him dra-mat-i-cal-ly re-gard-ed if either by birth or other cir-cum-stances he have what seems a half wil-ful over-rul-ing mor-bid-ness at the bot-tom of his na-ture For all men trag-i-cal-ly great are made so through a cer-tain mor-bid-ness Be sure of this O young am-bi-tion all mor-tal great-ness is but disease But as yet we have not to do with such an one but with quite another and still a man who if in-deed pe-cu-liar it on-ly re-sults again from another phase of the Quak-er mod-i-fied by in-di-vid-u-al cir-cum-stances Like Cap-tain Pe-leg Cap-tain Bil-dad was a well to do re-tired whale-man But un-like Cap-tain Pelegâ who cared not a rush for what are called se-ri-ous things and in-deed deemed those self same se-ri-ous things the veri-est of all tri-flesâ Cap-tain Bil-dad had not on-ly been orig-i-nal-ly ed-u-cat-ed ac-cord-ing to the strictest sect of Nan-tuck-et Quak-erism but all his sub-se-quent ocean life and the sight of many un-clad love-ly is-land crea-tures round the Hornâ all that had not moved this na-tive born Quak-er one sin-gle jot had not so much as al-tered one an-gle of his vest Still for all this im-mutable-ness was there some lack of com-mon con-sis-ten-cy about wor-thy Cap-tain Bil-dad Though re-fus-ing from con-sci-en-tious scru-ples to bear ar-ms against land in-vaders yet him-self had il-lim-itably in-vad-ed the At-lantic and Pa-cif-ic and though a sworn foe to hu-man blood-shed yet had he in his straight bodied coat spilled tuns upon tuns of le-viathan gore How now in the con-tem-pla-tive even-ing of his days the pious Bil-dad rec-on-ciled th-ese things in the rem-i-nis-cence I do not know but it did not seem to con-cern him much and very prob-a-bly he had long since come to the sage and sen-si-ble con-clu-sion that a manâ s reli-gion is one thing and this prac-ti-cal world quite another This world pays div-i-dends Ris-ing from a lit-tle cabin boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab to a har-pooneer in a broad shad bel-lied waist-coat from that be-com-ing boat head-er chief mate and cap-tain and fi-nal-ly a ship own-er Bil-dad as I hint-ed be-fore had con-clud-ed his ad-ven-tur-ous ca-reer by whol-ly re-tir-ing from ac-tive life at the good-ly age of six-ty and ded-i-cat-ing his re-main-ing days to the qui-et re-ceiv-ing of his well earned in-come Now Bil-dad I am sor-ry to say had the rep-u-ta-tion of be-ing an in-cor-ri-gi-ble old hunks and in his sea go-ing days a bit-ter hard task master They told me in Nan-tuck-et though it cer-tain-ly seems a cu-ri-ous sto-ry that when he sailed the old Categut whale-man his crew upon ar-riv-ing home were most-ly all car-ried ashore to the hospi-tal sore ex-haust-ed and worn out For a pious man espe-cial-ly for a Quak-er he was cer-tain-ly rather hard heart-ed to say the least He nev-er used to swear though at his men they said but some-how he got an inor-di-nate quan-ti-ty of cru-el un-mit-i-gat-ed hard work out of them When Bil-dad was a chief mate to have his drab coloured eye in-tent-ly look-ing at you made you feel com-plete-ly ner-vous till you could clutch some-thingâ a ham-mer or a mar-ling spike and go to work like mad at some-thing or other nev-er mind what In-do-lence and idle-ness per-ished be-fore him His own per-son was the ex-act em-bod-i-ment of his util-i-tar-i-an char-ac-ter On his long gaunt body he car-ried no spare flesh no su-per-flu-ous beard his chin hav-ing a soft eco-nom-i-cal nap to it like the worn nap of his broad brimmed hat Such then was the per-son that I saw seat-ed on the tran-som when I fol-lowed Cap-tain Pe-leg down in-to the cabin The space between the decks was small and there bolt upright sat old Bil-dad who al-ways sat so and nev-er leaned and this to save his coat tails His broad brim was placed be-side him his legs were stiffly crossed his drab ves-ture was but-toned up to his chin and spec-ta-cles on nose he seemed ab-sorbed in read-ing from a pon-der-ous vol-ume â Bil-dad â cried Cap-tain Pe-leg â at it again Bil-dad eh Ye have been study-ing those Scrip-tures now for the last thir-ty years to my cer-tain knowl-edge How far ye got Bil-dad â As if long ha-bit-u-at-ed to such pro-fane talk from his old ship-mate Bil-dad without notic-ing his pre-sent ir-rev-er-ence qui-et-ly looked up and see-ing me glanced again in-quir-ing-ly towards Pe-leg â He says heâ s our man Bil-dad â said Pe-leg â he wan-ts to ship â â Dost thee â said Bil-dad in a hol-low tone and turn-ing round to me â I dost â said I un-con-scious-ly he was so in-tense a Quak-er â What do ye think of him Bil-dad â said Pe-leg â Heâ ll do â said Bil-dad eye-ing me and then went on spelling away at his book in a mum-bling tone quite audi-ble I thought him the queer-est old Quak-er I ever saw espe-cial-ly as Pe-leg his friend and old ship-mate seemed such a blus-terer But I said noth-ing on-ly look-ing round me sharply Pe-leg now threw open a ch-est and draw-ing forth the shipâ s ar-ti-cles placed pen and ink be-fore him and seat-ed him-self at a lit-tle table I be-gan to think it was high time to set-tle with my-self at what ter-ms I would be willing to en-gage for the voy-age I was al-ready aware that in the whal-ing busi-ness they paid no wages but all hands in-clud-ing the cap-tain re-ceived cer-tain shares of the profits called lays and that th-ese lays were pro-por-tioned to the de-gree of im-por-tance per-tain-ing to the re-spec-tive du-ties of the shipâ s com-pa-ny I was al-so aware that be-ing a green hand at whal-ing my own lay would not be very large but con-sid-er-ing that I was used to the sea could steer a ship splice a rope and all that I made no doubt that from all I had heard I should be of-fered at least the 275th layâ that is the 275th part of the clear net pro-ceeds of the voy-age what-ev-er that might even-tu-al-ly amount to And though the 275th lay was what they call a rather long lay yet it was bet-ter than noth-ing and if we had a lucky voy-age might pret-ty near-ly pay for the cloth-ing I would wear out on it not to speak of my three yearsâ beef and board for which I would not have to pay one stiv-er It might be thought that this was a poor way to ac-cu-mu-late a prince-ly for-tuneâ and so it was a very poor way in-deed But I am one of those that nev-er take on about prince-ly for-tunes and am quite con-tent if the world is ready to board and lodge me while I am put-ting up at this grim sign of the Thun-der Cloud Upon the whole I thought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing but would not have been sur-prised had I been of-fered the 2th con-sid-er-ing I was of a broad shoul-dered make But one thing nev-er-the-less that made me a lit-tle distrust-ful about re-ceiv-ing a gen-er-ous share of the profits was this Ashore I had heard some-thing of both Cap-tain Pe-leg and his unac-count-able old crony Bil-dad how that they be-ing the prin-ci-pal pro-pri-etors of the Pe-quod there-fore the other and more in-con-sid-er-able and scat-tered own-ers left near-ly the whole man-age-ment of the shipâ s af-fairs to th-ese two And I did not know but what the st-ingy old Bil-dad might have a mighty deal to say about ship-ping hands espe-cial-ly as I now found him on board the Pe-quod quite at home there in the cabin and read-ing his Bi-ble as if at his own fire-side Now while Pe-leg was vain-ly try-ing to mend a pen with his jack knife old Bil-dad to my no small sur-prise con-sid-er-ing that he was such an in-ter-est-ed par-ty in th-ese pro-ceed-ings Bil-dad nev-er heed-ed us but went on mum-bling to him-self out of his book â Lay not up for your-selves trea-sures upon earth where mothâ â â Well Cap-tain Bil-dad â in-ter-rupt-ed Pe-leg â what dâ ye say what lay shall we give this young man â â Thou know-est best â was the sepul-chral re-ply â the seven hun-dred and seven-ty seventh would-nâ t be too much would it â â where moth and rust do cor-rupt but lay â â â Lay in-deed thought I and such a lay the seven hun-dred and seven-ty seventh Well old Bil-dad you are deter-mined that I for one shall not lay up many lays here below where moth and rust do cor-rupt It was an ex-ceed-ing-ly long lay that in-deed and though from the mag-ni-tude of the fig-ure it might at first de-ceive a lands-man yet the slight-est con-sid-er-a-tion will show that though seven hun-dred and seven-ty seven is a pret-ty large num-ber yet when you come to make a teenth of it you will then see I say that the seven hun-dred and seven-ty seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven hun-dred and seven-ty seven gold dou-bloons and so I thought at the time â Why blast your eyes Bil-dad â cried Pe-leg â thou dost not want to swin-dle this young man he must have more than that â â Seven hun-dred and seven-ty seventh â again said Bil-dad without lift-ing his eyes and then went on mum-blingâ â for where your trea-sure is there will your heart be al-so â â I am go-ing to put him down for the three hun-dredth â said Pe-leg â do ye hear that Bil-dad The three hun-dredth lay I say â Bil-dad laid down his book and turn-ing solemn-ly towards him said â Cap-tain Pe-leg thou hast a gen-er-ous heart but thou must con-sid-er the du-ty thou owest to the other own-ers of this shipâ wi-d-ows and or-phans many of themâ and that if we too abun-dant-ly re-ward the labors of this young man we may be tak-ing the bread from those wi-d-ows and those or-phans The seven hun-dred and seven-ty seventh lay Cap-tain Pe-leg â â Thou Bil-dad â roared Pe-leg start-ing up and clat-ter-ing about the cabin â Blast ye Cap-tain Bil-dad if I had fol-lowed thy ad-vice in th-ese mat-ters I would afore now had a con-science to lug about that would be heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round Cape Horn â â Cap-tain Pe-leg â said Bil-dad steadi-ly â thy con-science may be draw-ing ten inch-es of water or ten fath-oms I canâ t tell but as thou art still an im-pen-i-tent man Cap-tain Pe-leg I great-ly fear lest thy con-science be but a leaky one and will in the end sink thee founder-ing down to the fiery pit Cap-tain Pe-leg â â Fiery pit fiery pit ye in-sult me man past all nat-u-ral bear-ing ye in-sult me Itâ s an all fired ou-trage to tell any hu-man crea-ture that heâ s bound to hell Flukes and flames Bil-dad say that again to me and start my soul bolts but Iâ llâ Iâ llâ yes Iâ ll swal-low a live goat with all his hair and horns on Out of the cabin ye cant-ing drab coloured son of a wood-en gunâ a straight wake with ye â As he thun-dered out this he made a rush at Bil-dad but with a marvel-lous oblique slid-ing celer-i-ty Bil-dad for that time elud-ed him Alarmed at this ter-ri-ble out-burst between the two prin-ci-pal and re-spon-si-ble own-ers of the ship and feel-ing half a mind to give up all idea of sail-ing in a ves-sel so ques-tion-ably owned and tem-porar-i-ly com-mand-ed I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bil-dad who I made no doubt was all eager-ness to van-ish from be-fore the awak-ened wrath of Pe-leg But to my as-ton-ish-ment he sat down again on the tran-som very qui-et-ly and seemed to have not the slight-est in-ten-tion of with-draw-ing He seemed quite used to im-pen-i-tent Pe-leg and his ways As for Pe-leg after let-ting off his rage as he had there seemed no more left in him and he too sat down like a lamb though he twitched a lit-tle as if still ner-vous-ly agi-tat-ed â Whew â he whis-tled at lastâ â the squal-lâ s gone off to lee-ward I think Bil-dad thou used to be good at sharp-en-ing a lance mend that pen will ye My jack knife here needs the grind-stone Thatâ s he thank ye Bil-dad Now then my young man Ish-maelâ s thy name did-nâ t ye say Well then down ye go here Ish-mael for the three hun-dredth lay â â Cap-tain Pe-leg â said I â I have a friend with me who wan-ts to ship tooâ shall I bring him down to mor-row â â To be sure â said Pe-leg â Fetch him along and weâ ll look at him â â What lay does he want â groaned Bil-dad glanc-ing up from the book in which he had again been bury-ing him-self â Oh nev-er thee mind about that Bil-dad â said Pe-leg â Has he ever whaled it any â turn-ing to me â Killed more whales than I can count Cap-tain Pe-leg â â Well bring him along then â And after sign-ing the papers off I went noth-ing doubt-ing but that I had done a good morn-ingâ s work and that the Pe-quod was the iden-ti-cal ship that Yo-jo had pro-vid-ed to car-ry Quee-queg and me round the Cape But I had not pro-ceed-ed far when I be-gan to be-think me that the Cap-tain with whom I was to sail yet re-mained unseen by me though in-deed in many cas-es a whale ship will be com-plete-ly fit-ted out and re-ceive all her crew on board ere the cap-tain makes him-self vis-i-ble by ar-riv-ing to take com-mand for some-times th-ese voy-ages are so pro-longed and the shore in-ter-vals at home so ex-ceed-ing-ly brief that if the cap-tain have a fam-i-ly or any ab-sorb-ing con-cern-ment of that sort he does not trou-ble him-self much about his ship in port but leaves her to the own-ers till all is ready for sea How-ev-er it is al-ways as well to have a look at him be-fore ir-re-vo-ca-bly com-mit-ting your-self in-to his hands Turn-ing back I ac-cost-ed Cap-tain Pe-leg in-quir-ing where Cap-tain Ahab was to be found â And what dost thou want of Cap-tain Ahab Itâ s all right enough thou art shipped â â Yes but I should like to see him â â But I donâ t think thou wilt be able to at pre-sent I donâ t know ex-act-ly whatâ s the mat-ter with him but he keeps close in-side the house a sort of sick and yet he donâ t look so In fact he ainâ t sick but no he is-nâ t well either Any how young man he wonâ t al-ways see me so I donâ t sup-pose he will thee Heâ s a queer man Cap-tain Ahabâ so some thinkâ but a good one Oh thouâ lt like him well enough no fear no fear Heâ s a grand un-god-ly god like man Cap-tain Ahab does-nâ t speak much but when he does speak then you may well lis-ten Mark ye be fore-warned Ahabâ s above the com-mon Ahabâ s been in col-leges as well as â mong the can-ni-bals been used to deep-er won-ders than the waves fixed his fiery lance in might-i-er stranger foes than whales His lance aye the keen-est and the surest that out of all our isle Oh he ainâ t Cap-tain Bil-dad no and he ainâ t Cap-tain Pe-leg heâ s Ahab boy and Ahab of old thou know-est was a crowned king â â And a very vile one When that wicked king was slain the dogs did they not lick his blood â â Come hither to meâ hither hither â said Pe-leg with a sig-nif-i-cance in his eye that al-most star-tled me â Look ye lad nev-er say that on board the Pe-quod Nev-er say it any-where Cap-tain Ahab did not name him-self â Twas a fool-ish ig-no-rant whim of his crazy wi-d-owed mother who died when he was on-ly a twelve-month old And yet the old squaw Tistig at Gay-head said that the name would some-how prove prophet-ic And per-haps other fools like her may tell thee the same I wish to warn thee Itâ s a lie I know Cap-tain Ahab well Iâ ve sailed with him as mate years ago I know what he isâ a good manâ not a pious good man like Bil-dad but a swear-ing good manâ some-thing like meâ on-ly thereâ s a good deal more of him Aye aye I know that he was nev-er very jol-ly and I know that on the pas-sage home he was a lit-tle out of his mind for a spell but it was the sharp shoot-ing pains in his bleed-ing stump that brought that about as any one might see I know too that ever since he lost his leg last voy-age by that ac-cursed whale heâ s been a kind of moodyâ des-per-ate moody and sav-age some-times but that will all pass off And once for all let me tell thee and as-sure thee young man itâ s bet-ter to sail with a moody good cap-tain than a laugh-ing bad one So good bye to theeâ and wrong not Cap-tain Ahab be-cause he hap-pens to have a wicked name Be-sides my boy he has a wifeâ not three voy-ages wed-dedâ a sweet re-signed girl Think of that by that sweet girl that old man has a child hold ye then there can be any ut-ter hope-less harm in Ahab No no my lad strick-en blast-ed if he be Ahab has his hu-man-i-ties â As I walked away I was full of thought-ful-ness what had been in-ci-den-tal-ly re-vealed to me of Cap-tain Ahab filled me with a cer-tain wild vague-ness of pain-ful-ness con-cern-ing him And some-how at the time I felt a sym-pa-thy and a sor-row for him but for I donâ t know what un-less it was the cru-el loss of his leg And yet I al-so felt a strange awe of him but that sort of awe which I can-not at all de-scribe was not ex-act-ly awe I do not know what it was But I felt it and it did not dis-in-cline me towards him though I felt im-pa-tience at what seemed like mys-tery in him so im-per-fect-ly as he was known to me then How-ev-er my thoughts were at length car-ried in other direc-tions so that for the pre-sent dark Ahab slipped my mind CHAPTER 17 The Ra-madan As Quee-quegâ s Ra-madan or Fast-ing and Hu-mil-i-a-tion was to con-tin-ue all day I did not choose to dis-turb him till towards night fall for I cher-ish the great-est re-spect towards every-bodyâ s reli-gious obli-ga-tions nev-er mind how com-i-cal and could not find it in my heart to un-der-val-ue even a con-gre-ga-tion of an-ts wor-ship-ping a toad stool or those other crea-tures in cer-tain parts of our earth who with a de-gree of foot-man-ism quite un-prece-dent-ed in other plan-ets bow down be-fore the tor-so of a de-ceased land-ed pro-pri-etor mere-ly on ac-count of the inor-di-nate posses-sions yet owned and rent-ed in his name I say we good Pres-by-te-ri-an Chris-tians should be char-i-ta-ble in th-ese things and not fan-cy our-selves so vast-ly su-pe-ri-or to other mor-tals pa-gans and what not be-cause of their half crazy con-ceits on th-ese sub-jec-ts There was Quee-queg now cer-tain-ly en-ter-tain-ing the most ab-surd no-tions about Yo-jo and his Ra-madan â but what of that Quee-queg thought he knew what he was about I sup-pose he seemed to be con-tent and there let him rest All our ar-gu-ing with him would not avail let him be I say and Heav-en have mer-cy on us al-lâ Pres-by-te-ri-ans and Pa-gans alikeâ for we are all some-how dread-ful-ly cracked about the head and sad-ly need mend-ing Towards even-ing when I felt as-sured that all his per-for-mances and ri-tu-als must be over I went up to his room and knocked at the door but no an-swer I tried to open it but it was fas-tened in-side â Quee-queg â said I soft-ly through the key hole â all si-lent â I say Quee-queg why donâ t you speak Itâ s Iâ Ish-mael â But all re-mained still as be-fore I be-gan to grow alarmed I had al-lowed him such abun-dant time I thought he might have had an apoplec-tic fit I looked through the key hole but the door open-ing in-to an odd corner of the room the key hole prospect was but a crooked and sin-is-ter one I could on-ly see part of the foot board of the bed and a line of the wall but noth-ing more I was sur-prised to be-hold rest-ing against the wall the wood-en shaft of Quee-quegâ s har-poon which the land-la-dy the even-ing pre-vi-ous had tak-en from him be-fore our mount-ing to the cham-ber Thatâ s strange thought I but at any rate since the har-poon stands yon-der and he sel-dom or nev-er goes abroad without it there-fore he must be in-side here and no pos-si-ble mis-take â Quee-queg â Quee-queg â â all still Some-thing must have hap-pened Apoplexy I tried to burst open the door but it stub-born-ly re-sist-ed Run-ning down stairs I quick-ly stat-ed my sus-pi-cions to the first per-son I metâ the cham-ber maid â La la â she cried â I thought some-thing must be the mat-ter I went to make the bed after break-fast and the door was locked and not a mouse to be heard and itâ s been just so si-lent ever since But I thought may be you had both gone off and locked your bag-gage in for safe keep-ing La la maâ am â Mistress mur-der Mrs Hussey apoplexy â â and with th-ese cries she ran towards the kitchen I fol-low-ing Mrs Hussey soon ap-peared with a mus-tard pot in one hand and a vine-gar cruet in the other hav-ing just bro-ken away from the oc-cu-pa-tion of at-tend-ing to the cas-tors and scold-ing her lit-tle black boy mean-time â Wood house â cried I â which way to it Run for Godâ s sake and fetch some-thing to pry open the doorâ the axe â the axe heâ s had a stroke depend upon it â â and so say-ing I was un-me-thod-i-cal-ly rush-ing up stairs again emp-ty hand-ed when Mrs Hussey in-ter-posed the mus-tard pot and vine-gar cruet and the en-tire cas-tor of her coun-te-nance â Whatâ s the mat-ter with you young man â â Get the axe For Godâ s sake run for the doc-tor some one while I pry it open â â Look here â said the land-la-dy quick-ly put-ting down the vine-gar cruet so as to have one hand free â look here are you talk-ing about pry-ing open any of my doors â â and with that she seized my arm â Whatâ s the mat-ter with you Whatâ s the mat-ter with you ship-mate â In as calm but rapid a man-ner as pos-si-ble I gave her to un-der-stand the whole case Un-con-scious-ly clap-ping the vine-gar cruet to one side of her nose she ru-mi-nat-ed for an in-stant then ex-claimedâ â No I havenâ t seen it since I put it there â Run-ning to a lit-tle clos-et un-der the land-ing of the stairs she glanced in and re-turn-ing told me that Quee-quegâ s har-poon was miss-ing â Heâ s killed him-self â she cried â Itâ s un-fortâ nate Stig-gs done over againâ there goes another coun-ter-paneâ God pi-ty his poor mother â it will be the ruin of my house Has the poor lad a sis-ter Whereâ s that girl â there Bet-ty go to Snarles the Pain-ter and tell him to paint me a sign withâ â no sui-cides per-mit-ted here and no smok-ing in the par-lor â â might as well kill both birds at once Kill The Lord be mer-ci-ful to his ghost Whatâ s that noise there You young man avast there â And run-ning up after me she caught me as I was again try-ing to force open the door â I donâ t al-low it I wonâ t have my premis-es spoiled Go for the lock-smith thereâ s one about a mile from here But avast â put-ting her hand in her side pock-et â hereâ s a key thatâ ll fit I guess letâ s see â And with that she turned it in the lock but alas Quee-quegâ s sup-ple-men-tal bolt re-mained un-with-drawn within â Have to burst it open â said I and was run-ning down the en-try a lit-tle for a good start when the land-la-dy caught at me again vow-ing I should not break down her premis-es but I tore from her and with a sud-den bodi-ly rush dashed my-self full against the mark With a prodi-gious noise the door flew open and the knob slam-ming against the wall sent the plaster to the ceil-ing and there good heav-ens there sat Quee-queg al-to-geth-er cool and self col-lect-ed right in the mid-dle of the room squat-ting on his hams and hold-ing Yo-jo on top of his head He looked nei-ther one way nor the other way but sat like a carved image with scarce a sign of ac-tive life â Quee-queg â said I go-ing up to him â Quee-queg whatâ s the mat-ter with you â â He hainâ t been a sit-tinâ so all day has he â said the land-la-dy But all we said not a word could we drag out of him I al-most felt like push-ing him over so as to change his po-si-tion for it was al-most in-tol-er-a-ble it seemed so pain-ful-ly and un-nat-u-ral-ly con-strained espe-cial-ly as in all prob-a-bil-i-ty he had been sit-ting so for up-wards of eight or ten hours go-ing too without his reg-u-lar meals â Mrs Hussey â said I â heâ s alive at all even-ts so leave us if you please and I will see to this strange af-fair my-self â Clos-ing the door upon the land-la-dy I en-deav-ored to pre-vail upon Quee-queg to take a chair but in vain There he sat and all he could doâ for all my po-lite arts and blan-dish-mentsâ he would not move a peg nor say a sin-gle word nor even look at me nor no-tice my pres-ence in the slight-est way I won-der thought I if this can pos-si-bly be a part of his Ra-madan do they fast on their hams that way in his na-tive is-land It must be so yes itâ s part of his creed I sup-pose well then let him rest heâ ll get up soon-er or later no doubt It canâ t last for ever thank God and his Ra-madan on-ly comes once a year and I donâ t believe itâ s very punc-tu-al then I went down to sup-per After sit-ting a long time lis-ten-ing to the long sto-ries of some sailors who had just come from a plum pud-ding voy-age as they called it that is a short whal-ing voy-age in a schooner or brig con-fined to the north of the line in the At-lantic Ocean on-ly after lis-ten-ing to th-ese plum pud-dingers till near-ly eleven oâ clock I went up stairs to go to bed feel-ing quite sure by this time Quee-queg must cer-tain-ly have brought his Ra-madan to a ter-mi-na-tion But no there he was just where I had left him he had not stirred an inch I be-gan to grow vexed with him it seemed so down-right sense-less and in-sane to be sit-ting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room hold-ing a piece of wood on his head â For heav-enâ s sake Quee-queg get up and shake your-self get up and have some sup-per Youâ ll starve youâ ll kill your-self Quee-queg â But not a word did he re-ply De-s-pair-ing of him there-fore I deter-mined to go to bed and to sleep and no doubt be-fore a great while he would fol-low me But pre-vi-ous to turn-ing in I took my heavy bearskin jack-et and threw it over him as it promised to be a very cold night and he had noth-ing but his or-di-nary round jack-et on For some time do all I would I could not get in-to the fain-test doze I had blown out the can-dle and the mere thought of Quee-quegâ not four feet of-fâ sit-ting there in that uneasy po-si-tion stark alone in the cold and dark this made me real-ly wretched Think of it sleep-ing all night in the same room with a wide awake pa-gan on his hams in this dreary unac-count-able Ra-madan But some-how I dropped off at last and knew noth-ing more till break of day when look-ing over the bed-side there squat-ted Quee-queg as if he had been screwed down to the floor But as soon as the first glimpse of sun en-tered the win-dow up he got with stiff and grat-ing join-ts but with a cheer-ful look limped towards me where I lay pressed his fore-head again against mine and said his Ra-madan was over Now as I be-fore hint-ed I have no ob-jec-tion to any per-sonâ s reli-gion be it what it may so long as that per-son does not kill or in-sult any other per-son be-cause that other per-son donâ t believe it al-so But when a manâ s reli-gion be-comes real-ly fran-tic when it is a pos-i-tive tor-ment to him and in fine makes this earth of ours an un-com-fort-able inn to lodge in then I think it high time to take that in-di-vid-u-al aside and ar-gue the point with him And just so I now did with Quee-queg â Quee-queg â said I â get in-to bed now and lie and lis-ten to me â I then went on begin-ning with the rise and progress of the prim-i-tive reli-gions and com-ing down to the var-i-ous reli-gions of the pre-sent time dur-ing which time I la-bored to show Quee-queg that all th-ese Len-ts Ra-madans and pro-longed ham squat-tings in cold cheer-less rooms were stark non-sense bad for the health use-less for the soul op-posed in short to the ob-vi-ous laws of Hy-giene and com-mon sense I told him too that he be-ing in other things such an ex-treme-ly sen-si-ble and sa-ga-cious sav-age it pained me very bad-ly pained me to see him now so de-plorably fool-ish about this ridicu-lous Ra-madan of his Be-sides ar-gued I fast-ing makes the body cave in hence the spir-it caves in and all thoughts born of a fast must ne-c-es-sar-i-ly be half starved This is the rea-son why most dyspep-tic reli-gion-ists cher-ish such me-lan-choly no-tions about their hereafters In one word Quee-queg said I rather di-gres-sive-ly hell is an idea first born on an undi-gest-ed ap-ple dumpling and since then per-pet-u-at-ed through the hered-i-tary dyspep-sias nur-tured by Ra-madans I then asked Quee-queg whether he him-self was ever trou-bled with dyspep-sia ex-press-ing the idea very plain-ly so that he could take it in He said no on-ly upon one me-morable oc-ca-sion It was after a great feast giv-en by his father the king on the gain-ing of a great bat-tle where-in fifty of the ene-my had been killed by about two oâ clock in the after-noon and all cooked and eat-en that very even-ing â No more Quee-queg â said I shud-der-ing â that will do â for I knew the in-fer-ences without his fur-ther hint-ing them I had seen a sailor who had visit-ed that very is-land and he told me that it was the cus-tom when a great bat-tle had been gained there to bar-be-cue all the slain in the yard or gar-den of the vic-tor and then one by one they were placed in great wood-en trenchers and gar-nished round like a pi-lau with bread-fruit and co-coanuts and with some pars-ley in their mouths were sent round with the vic-torâ s com-pli-men-ts to all his friends just as though th-ese pre-sen-ts were so many Christ-mas turkeys After all I do not think that my re-marks about reli-gion made much im-pres-sion upon Quee-queg Be-cause in the first place he some-how seemed dull of hear-ing on that im-por-tant sub-ject un-less con-sid-ered from his own point of view and in the se-cond place he did not more than one third un-der-stand me couch my ideas sim-ply as I would and fi-nal-ly he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true reli-gion than I did He looked at me with a sort of con-de-scend-ing con-cern and com-pas-sion as though he thought it a great pi-ty that such a sen-si-ble young man should be so hope-less-ly lost to evan-gel-i-cal pa-gan pi-ety At last we rose and dressed and Quee-queg tak-ing a prodi-gious-ly hearty break-fast of chow-ders of all sorts so that the land-la-dy should not make much profit by rea-son of his Ra-madan we sal-lied out to board the Pe-quod saun-ter-ing along and pick-ing our teeth with hal-ibut bones CHAPTER 18 His Mark As we were walk-ing down the end of the wharf towards the ship Quee-queg car-ry-ing his har-poon Cap-tain Pe-leg in his gruff voice loud-ly hailed us from his wig-wam say-ing he had not sus-pect-ed my friend was a can-ni-bal and fur-ther-more an-nounc-ing that he let no can-ni-bals on board that craft un-less they pre-vi-ous-ly pro-duced their papers â What do you mean by that Cap-tain Pe-leg â said I now jump-ing on the bul-warks and leav-ing my com-rade stand-ing on the wharf â I mean â he replied â he must show his papers â â Yes â said Cap-tain Bil-dad in his hol-low voice stick-ing his head from be-hind Pelegâ s out of the wig-wam â He must show that heâ s con-vert-ed Son of dark-ness â he added turn-ing to Quee-queg â art thou at pre-sent in com-mu-nion with any Chris-tian church â â Why â said I â heâ s a mem-ber of the first Con-gre-ga-tion-al Church â Here be it said that many tat-tooed sav-ages sail-ing in Nan-tuck-et ships at last come to be con-vert-ed in-to the church-es â First Con-gre-ga-tion-al Church â cried Bil-dad â what that wor-ships in Dea-con Deuteron-o-my Cole-manâ s meet-ing house â and so say-ing tak-ing out his spec-ta-cles he rubbed them with his great yel-low ban-dana hand-ker-chief and put-ting them on very care-ful-ly came out of the wig-wam and lean-ing stiffly over the bul-warks took a good long look at Quee-queg â How long hath he been a mem-ber â he then said turn-ing to me â not very long I rather guess young man â â No â said Pe-leg â and he has-nâ t been bap-tized right either or it would have washed some of that devilâ s blue off his face â â Do tell now â cried Bil-dad â is this Philis-tine a reg-u-lar mem-ber of Dea-con Deuteron-o-myâ s meet-ing I nev-er saw him go-ing there and I pass it every Lordâ s day â â I donâ t know any-thing about Dea-con Deuteron-o-my or his meet-ing â said I â all I know is that Quee-queg here is a born mem-ber of the First Con-gre-ga-tion-al Church He is a dea-con him-self Quee-queg is â â Young man â said Bil-dad stern-ly â thou art sky-lark-ing with meâ ex-plain thy-self thou young Hit-tite What church dost thee mean an-swer me â Find-ing my-self thus hard pushed I replied â I mean sir the same an-cient Catholic Church to which you and I and Cap-tain Pe-leg there and Quee-queg here and all of us and every motherâ s son and soul of us be-long the great and ever-last-ing First Con-gre-ga-tion of this whole wor-ship-ping world we all be-long to that on-ly some of us cher-ish some queer crotch-ets no ways touch-ing the grand belief in that we all join hands â â Splice thou meanâ st splice hands â cried Pe-leg draw-ing nearer â Young man youâ d bet-ter ship for a mis-sion-ary in-stead of a fore mast hand I nev-er heard a bet-ter ser-mon Dea-con Deuteron-o-myâ why Father Map-ple him-self could-nâ t beat it and heâ s reck-oned some-thing Come aboard come aboard nev-er mind about the papers I say tell Quo-hog thereâ whatâ s that you call him tell Quo-hog to step along By the great an-chor what a har-poon heâ s got there looks like good stuff that and he han-dles it about right I say Quo-hog or what-ev-er your name is did you ever stand in the head of a whale boat did you ever strike a fish â Without say-ing a word Quee-queg in his wild sort of way jumped upon the bul-warks from thence in-to the bows of one of the whale boats hang-ing to the side and then brac-ing his left knee and pois-ing his har-poon cried out in some such way as this â â Capâ ain you see him small drop tar on water dere You see him well spose him one whale eye well den â and tak-ing sharp aim at it he dart-ed the iron right over old Bil-dadâ s broad brim clean across the shipâ s decks and struck the glis-ten-ing tar spot out of sight â Now â said Quee-queg qui-et-ly haul-ing in the line â spos ee him whale e eye why dad whale dead â â Quick Bil-dad â said Pe-leg his part-ner who aghast at the close vicin-i-ty of the fly-ing har-poon had re-treat-ed towards the cabin gang-way â Quick I say you Bil-dad and get the shipâ s papers We must have Hedge-hog there I mean Quo-hog in one of our boats Look ye Quo-hog weâ ll give ye the nineti-eth lay and thatâ s more than ever was giv-en a har-pooneer yet out of Nan-tuck-et â So down we went in-to the cabin and to my great joy Quee-queg was soon en-rolled among the same shipâ s com-pa-ny to which I my-self be-longed When all pre-lim-i-nar-ies were over and Pe-leg had got every-thing ready for sign-ing he turned to me and said â I guess Quo-hog there donâ t know how to write does he I say Quo-hog blast ye dost thou sign thy name or make thy mark â But at this ques-tion Quee-queg who had twice or thrice be-fore tak-en part in sim-i-lar cer-e-monies looked no ways abashed but tak-ing the of-fered pen copied upon the paper in the prop-er place an ex-act coun-ter-part of a queer round fig-ure which was tat-tooed upon his arm so that through Cap-tain Pelegâ s ob-sti-nate mis-take touch-ing his ap-pella-tive it stood some-thing like this â Quo-hog his X mark Mean-while Cap-tain Bil-dad sat earnest-ly and stead-fast-ly eye-ing Quee-queg and at last ris-ing solemn-ly and fum-bling in the huge pock-ets of his broad skirt-ed drab coat took out a bun-dle of trac-ts and select-ing one en-ti-tled â The Lat-ter Day Com-ing or No Time to Lose â placed it in Quee-quegâ s hands and then grasp-ing them and the book with both his looked earnest-ly in-to his eyes and said â Son of dark-ness I must do my du-ty by thee I am part own-er of this ship and feel con-cerned for the souls of all its crew if thou still clingest to thy Pa-gan ways which I sad-ly fear I be-seech thee re-main not for aye a Belial bonds-man Spurn the idol Bell and the hideous dragon turn from the wrath to come mind thine eye I say oh good-ness gra-cious steer clear of the fiery pit â Some-thing of the salt sea yet lin-gered in old Bil-dadâ s lan-guage hetero-ge-neous-ly mixed with Scrip-tural and do-mes-tic phras-es â Avast there avast there Bil-dad avast now spoil-ing our har-pooneer â cried Pe-leg â Pious har-pooneers nev-er make good voy-ager-sâ it takes the shark out of â em no har-pooneer is worth a straw who aint pret-ty shark-ish There was young Nat Swaine once the bravest boat head-er out of all Nan-tuck-et and the Vine-yard he joined the meet-ing and nev-er came to good He got so fright-ened about his plaguy soul that he shrinked and sheered away from whales for fear of after claps in case he got stove and went to Davy Jones â â Pe-leg Pe-leg â said Bil-dad lift-ing his eyes and hands â thou thy-self as I my-self hast seen many a per-ilous time thou know-est Pe-leg what it is to have the fear of death how then canâ st thou prate in this un-god-ly guise Thou beli-est thine own heart Pe-leg Tell me when this same Pe-quod here had her three masts over-board in that typhoon on Ja-pan that same voy-age when thou went mate with Cap-tain Ahab didâ st thou not think of Death and the Judg-ment then â â Hear him hear him now â cried Pe-leg march-ing across the cabin and thrust-ing his hands far down in-to his pock-ets â â hear him all of ye Think of that When every mo-ment we thought the ship would sink Death and the Judg-ment then What With all three masts mak-ing such an ever-last-ing thun-der-ing against the side and every sea break-ing over us fore and aft Think of Death and the Judg-ment then No no time to think about Death then Life was what Cap-tain Ahab and I was think-ing of and how to save all hand-sâ how to rig jury mast-sâ how to get in-to the near-est port that was what I was think-ing of â Bil-dad said no more but but-ton-ing up his coat stalked on deck where we fol-lowed him There he stood very qui-et-ly over-look-ing some sail-mak-ers who were mend-ing a top sail in the waist Now and then he stooped to pick up a patch or save an end of tarred twine which other-wise might have been wast-ed CHAPTER 19 The Prophet â Ship-mates have ye shipped in that ship â Quee-queg and I had just left the Pe-quod and were saun-ter-ing away from the water for the mo-ment each oc-cu-pied with his own thoughts when the above words were put to us by a stranger who paus-ing be-fore us lev-elled his mas-sive fore-fin-ger at the ves-sel in ques-tion He was but shab-bi-ly ap-par-elled in fad-ed jack-et and patched trowsers a rag of a black hand-ker-chief in-vest-ing his neck A con-flu-ent small pox had in all direc-tions flowed over his face and left it like the com-pli-cat-ed ribbed bed of a tor-rent when the rush-ing waters have been dried up â Have ye shipped in her â he re-peat-ed â You mean the ship Pe-quod I sup-pose â said I try-ing to gain a lit-tle more time for an un-in-ter-rupt-ed look at him â Aye the Pe-quodâ that ship there â he said draw-ing back his whole arm and then rapid-ly shov-ing it straight out from him with the fixed bay-o-net of his point-ed finger dart-ed full at the ob-ject â Yes â said I â we have just signed the ar-ti-cles â â Any-thing down there about your souls â â About what â â Oh per-haps you havâ nâ t got any â he said quick-ly â No mat-ter though I know many chaps that havâ nâ t got any â good luck to â em and they are all the bet-ter off for it A soulâ s a sort of a fifth wheel to a wagon â â What are you jab-ber-ing about ship-mate â said I â Heâ s got enough though to make up for all de-fi-cien-cies of that sort in other chaps â abrupt-ly said the stranger plac-ing a ner-vous em-pha-sis upon the word he â Quee-queg â said I â letâ s go this fel-low has bro-ken loose from some-where heâ s talk-ing about some-thing and some-body we donâ t know â â Stop â cried the stranger â Ye said trueâ ye havâ nâ t seen Old Thun-der yet have ye â â Whoâ s Old Thun-der â said I again rivet-ed with the in-sane earnest-ness of his man-ner â Cap-tain Ahab â â What the cap-tain of our ship the Pe-quod â â Aye among some of us old sailor chaps he goes by that name Ye havâ nâ t seen him yet have ye â â No we havâ nâ t Heâ s sick they say but is get-ting bet-ter and will be all right again be-fore long â â All right again be-fore long â laughed the stranger with a solemn-ly deri-sive sort of laugh â Look ye when Cap-tain Ahab is all right then this left arm of mine will be all right not be-fore â â What do you know about him â â What did they tell you about him Say that â â They did-nâ t tell much of any-thing about him on-ly Iâ ve heard that heâ s a good whale hunter and a good cap-tain to his crew â â Thatâ s true thatâ s trueâ yes both true enough But you must jump when he gives an order Step and growl growl and goâ thatâ s the word with Cap-tain Ahab But noth-ing about that thing that hap-pened to him off Cape Horn long ago when he lay like dead for three days and nights noth-ing about that dead-ly skrim-mage with the Spa-niard afore the al-tar in San-ta â heard noth-ing about that eh Noth-ing about the sil-ver cal-abash he spat in-to And noth-ing about his los-ing his leg last voy-age ac-cord-ing to the prophe-cy Did-nâ t ye hear a word about them mat-ters and some-thing more eh No I donâ t think ye did how could ye Who knows it Not all Nan-tuck-et I guess But howsâ ever may-hap yeâ ve heard tell about the leg and how he lost it aye ye have heard of that I dare say Oh yes that every one knows aâ mostâ I mean they know heâ s on-ly one leg and that a par-ma-cetti took the other off â â My friend â said I â what all this gib-ber-ish of yours is about I donâ t know and I donâ t much care for it seems to me that you must be a lit-tle da-m-aged in the head But if you are speak-ing of Cap-tain Ahab of that ship there the Pe-quod then let me tell you that I know all about the loss of his leg â â All about it ehâ sure you do â all â â Pret-ty sure â With finger point-ed and eye lev-elled at the Pe-quod the beg-gar like stranger stood a mo-ment as if in a trou-bled rev-er-ie then start-ing a lit-tle turned and said â â Yeâ ve shipped have ye Names down on the papers Well well whatâ s signed is signed and whatâ s to be will be and then again per-haps it wonâ t be after all Any-how itâ s all fixed and ar-ranged aâ ready and some sailors or other must go with him I sup-pose as well th-ese as any other men God pi-ty â em Morn-ing to ye ship-mates morn-ing the in-ef-fa-ble heav-ens bless ye Iâ m sor-ry I stopped ye â â Look here friend â said I â if you have any-thing im-por-tant to tell us out with it but if you are on-ly try-ing to bam-boo-zle us you are mis-tak-en in your game thatâ s all I have to say â â And itâ s said very well and I like to hear a chap talk up that way you are just the man for himâ the likes of ye Morn-ing to ye ship-mates morn-ing Oh when ye get there tell â em Iâ ve con-clud-ed not to make one of â em â â Ah my dear fel-low you canâ t fool us that wayâ you canâ t fool us It is the easi-est thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a great se-cret in him â â Morn-ing to ye ship-mates morn-ing â â Morn-ing it is â said I â Come along Quee-queg letâ s leave this crazy man But stop tell me your name will you â â Eli-jah â Eli-jah thought I and we walked away both com-ment-ing after each otherâ s fash-ion upon this ragged old sailor and agreed that he was noth-ing but a hum-bug try-ing to be a bug-bear But we had not gone per-haps above a hun-dred yards when chanc-ing to turn a corner and look-ing back as I did so who should be seen but Eli-jah fol-low-ing us though at a dis-tance Some-how the sight of him struck me so that I said noth-ing to Quee-queg of his be-ing be-hind but passed on with my com-rade anx-ious to see whether the stranger would turn the same corner that we did He did and then it seemed to me that he was dog-ging us but with what in-tent I could not for the life of me imag-ine This cir-cum-stance cou-pled with his am-bigu-ous half hint-ing half re-veal-ing shroud-ed sort of talk now be-gat in me all kinds of vague won-der-men-ts and half ap-pre-hen-sions and all con-nect-ed with the Pe-quod and Cap-tain Ahab and the leg he had lost and the Cape Horn fit and the sil-ver cal-abash and what Cap-tain Pe-leg had said of him when I left the ship the day pre-vi-ous and the pre-dic-tion of the squaw Tistig and the voy-age we had bound our-selves to sail and a hun-dred other shad-owy things I was re-solved to sat-is-fy my-self whether this ragged Eli-jah was real-ly dog-ging us or not and with that in-tent crossed the way with Quee-queg and on that side of it re-traced our steps But Eli-jah passed on without seem-ing to no-tice us This relieved me and once more and fi-nal-ly as it seemed to me I pro-nounced him in my heart a hum-bug CHAPTER 2 All Astir A day or two passed and there was great ac-tiv-i-ty aboard the Pe-quod Not on-ly were the old sails be-ing mend-ed but new sails were com-ing on board and bolts of can-vas and coils of rig-ging in short every-thing be-to-kened that the shipâ s prepa-ra-tions were hur-ry-ing to a close Cap-tain Pe-leg sel-dom or nev-er went ashore but sat in his wig-wam keep-ing a sharp look out upon the hands Bil-dad did all the pur-chas-ing and pro-vid-ing at the stores and the men em-ployed in the hold and on the rig-ging were work-ing till long after night fall On the day fol-low-ing Quee-quegâ s sign-ing the ar-ti-cles word was giv-en at all the in-ns where the shipâ s com-pa-ny were stop-ping that their ch-ests must be on board be-fore night for there was no telling how soon the ves-sel might be sail-ing So Quee-queg and I got down our traps re-solv-ing how-ev-er to sleep ashore till the last But it seems they al-ways give very long no-tice in th-ese cas-es and the ship did not sail for sev-er-al days But no won-der there was a good deal to be done and there is no telling how many things to be thought of be-fore the Pe-quod was ful-ly equipped Every one knows what a mul-ti-tude of thingsâ beds sauce pans knives and forks shov-els and tongs nap-kins nut crack-ers and what not are indis-pens-able to the busi-ness of house-keep-ing Just so with whal-ing which ne-ces-si-tates a three yearsâ house-keep-ing upon the wide ocean far from all gro-cers coster-mon-gers doc-tors bak-ers and bankers And though this al-so holds true of mer-chant ves-sels yet not by any means to the same ex-tent as with whale-men For be-sides the great length of the whal-ing voy-age the numer-ous ar-ti-cles pe-cu-liar to the prose-cu-tion of the fish-ery and the im-pos-si-bil-i-ty of re-plac-ing them at the re-mote har-bors usu-al-ly fre-quent-ed it must be re-mem-bered that of all ships whal-ing ves-sels are the most ex-posed to ac-ci-den-ts of all kinds and espe-cial-ly to the destruc-tion and loss of the very things upon which the suc-cess of the voy-age most depends Hence the spare boats spare spars and spare lines and har-poons and spare every-things al-most but a spare Cap-tain and du-pli-cate ship At the pe-ri-od of our ar-rival at the Is-land the heav-i-est stor-age of the Pe-quod had been al-most com-plet-ed com-pris-ing her beef bread water fuel and iron hoops and staves But as be-fore hint-ed for some time there was a con-tin-u-al fetch-ing and car-ry-ing on board of divers od-ds and ends of things both large and small Chief among those who did this fetch-ing and car-ry-ing was Cap-tain Bil-dadâ s sis-ter a lean old lady of a most deter-mined and in-de-fati-ga-ble spir-it but withal very kind-heart-ed who seemed re-solved that if she could help it noth-ing should be found want-ing in the Pe-quod after once fair-ly get-ting to sea At one time she would come on board with a jar of pick-les for the ste-wardâ s pantry another time with a bunch of quil-ls for the chief mateâ s desk where he kept his log a third time with a roll of flan-nel for the small of some oneâ s rheumat-ic back Nev-er did any wo-man bet-ter de-serve her name which was Char-i-tyâ Aunt Char-i-ty as every-body called her And like a sis-ter of char-i-ty did this char-i-ta-ble Aunt Char-i-ty bus-tle about hither and thith-er ready to turn her hand and heart to any-thing that promised to yield safe-ty com-fort and con-so-la-tion to all on board a ship in which her beloved brother Bil-dad was con-cerned and in which she her-self owned a score or two of well saved dol-lars But it was startling to see this ex-cel-lent heart-ed Quak-er-ess com-ing on board as she did the last day with a long oil la-dle in one hand and a still longer whal-ing lance in the other Nor was Bil-dad him-self nor Cap-tain Pe-leg at all back-ward As for Bil-dad he car-ried about with him a long list of the ar-ti-cles need-ed and at every fresh ar-rival down went his mark op-po-site that ar-ti-cle upon the paper Every once in a while Pe-leg came hob-bling out of his whale-bone den roar-ing at the men down the hatch-ways roar-ing up to the rig-gers at the mast head and then con-clud-ed by roar-ing back in-to his wig-wam Dur-ing th-ese days of prepa-ra-tion Quee-queg and I often visit-ed the craft and as often I asked about Cap-tain Ahab and how he was and when he was go-ing to come on board his ship To th-ese ques-tions they would an-swer that he was get-ting bet-ter and bet-ter and was ex-pect-ed aboard every day mean-time the two cap-tains Pe-leg and Bil-dad could at-tend to every-thing ne-c-es-sary to fit the ves-sel for the voy-age If I had been down-right hon-est with my-self I would have seen very plain-ly in my heart that I did but half fan-cy be-ing com-mit-ted this way to so long a voy-age without once lay-ing my eyes on the man who was to be the ab-so-lute dic-ta-tor of it so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open sea But when a man sus-pec-ts any wrong it some-times hap-pens that if he be al-ready in-volved in the mat-ter he insen-si-bly strives to cover up his sus-pi-cions even from him-self And much this way it was with me I said noth-ing and tried to think noth-ing At last it was giv-en out that some time next day the ship would cer-tain-ly sail So next morn-ing Quee-queg and I took a very ear-ly start CHAPTER 21 Go-ing Aboard It was near-ly six oâ clock but on-ly grey im-per-fect misty dawn when we drew nigh the wharf â There are some sailors run-ning ahead there if I see right â said I to Quee-queg â it canâ t be shad-ows sheâ s off by sun-rise I guess come on â â Avast â cried a voice whose own-er at the same time com-ing close be-hind us laid a hand upon both our shoul-ders and then insin-u-at-ing him-self between us stood stoop-ing for-ward a lit-tle in the uncer-tain twi-light strange-ly peer-ing from Quee-queg to me It was Eli-jah â Go-ing aboard â â Hands off will you â said I â Lookee here â said Quee-queg shak-ing him-self â go â way â â Ainâ t go-ing aboard then â â Yes we are â said I â but what busi-ness is that of yours Do you know Mr Eli-jah that I con-sid-er you a lit-tle im-per-ti-nent â â No no no I was-nâ t aware of that â said Eli-jah slow-ly and won-der-ing-ly look-ing from me to Quee-queg with the most unac-count-able glances â Eli-jah â said I â you will oblige my friend and me by with-draw-ing We are go-ing to the In-di-an and Pa-cif-ic Oceans and would pre-fer not to be de-tained â â Ye be be ye Com-ing back afore break-fast â â Heâ s cracked Quee-queg â said I â come on â â Hol-loa â cried sta-tion-ary Eli-jah hail-ing us when we had re-moved a few paces â Nev-er mind him â said I â Quee-queg come on â But he stole up to us again and sud-den-ly clap-ping his hand on my shoul-der saidâ â Did ye see any-thing look-ing like men go-ing towards that ship a while ago â Struck by this plain mat-ter of fact ques-tion I an-swered say-ing â Yes I thought I did see four or five men but it was too dim to be sure â â Very dim very dim â said Eli-jah â Morn-ing to ye â Once more we quit-ted him but once more he came soft-ly after us and touch-ing my shoul-der again said â See if you can find â em now will ye â Find who â â Morn-ing to ye morn-ing to ye â he re-joined again mov-ing off â Oh I was go-ing to warn ye again-stâ but nev-er mind nev-er mindâ itâ s all one all in the fam-i-ly too â sharp frost this morn-ing ainâ t it Good bye to ye Shanâ t see ye again very soon I guess un-less itâ s be-fore the Grand Jury â And with th-ese cracked words he fi-nal-ly depart-ed leav-ing me for the mo-ment in no small won-der-ment at his fran-tic im-pu-dence At last step-ping on board the Pe-quod we found every-thing in pro-found qui-et not a soul mov-ing The cabin en-trance was locked within the hatch-es were all on and lum-bered with coils of rig-ging Go-ing for-ward to the fore-cas-tle we found the slide of the scut-tle open See-ing a light we went down and found on-ly an old rig-ger there wrapped in a tat-tered pea jack-et He was thrown at whole length upon two ch-ests his face down-wards and in-closed in his fold-ed ar-ms The pro-found-est slum-ber slept upon him â Those sailors we saw Quee-queg where can they have gone to â said I look-ing du-bi-ous-ly at the sleep-er But it seemed that when on the wharf Quee-queg had not at all no-ticed what I now al-lud-ed to hence I would have thought my-self to have been op-ti-cal-ly de-ceived in that mat-ter were it not for Eli-jahâ s other-wise in-ex-pli-ca-ble ques-tion But I beat the thing down and again mark-ing the sleep-er joc-u-lar-ly hint-ed to Quee-queg that per-haps we had best sit up with the body telling him to estab-lish him-self ac-cord-ing-ly He put his hand upon the sleep-erâ s rear as though feel-ing if it was soft enough and then without more ado sat qui-et-ly down there â Gra-cious Quee-queg donâ t sit there â said I â Oh per-ry dood seat â said Quee-queg â my coun-try way wonâ t hurt him face â â Face â said I â call that his face very benev-o-lent coun-te-nance then but how hard he breathes heâ s heav-ing him-self get off Quee-queg you are heavy itâ s grind-ing the face of the poor Get off Quee-queg Look heâ ll twitch you off soon I won-der he donâ t wake â Quee-queg re-moved him-self to just beyond the head of the sleep-er and light-ed his tom-a-hawk pipe I sat at the feet We kept the pipe pass-ing over the sleep-er from one to the other Mean-while upon ques-tion-ing him in his bro-ken fash-ion Quee-queg gave me to un-der-stand that in his land owing to the ab-sence of set-tees and so-fas of all sorts the king chiefs and great peo-ple gen-er-al-ly were in the cus-tom of fat-ten-ing some of the low-er orders for ot-tomans and to fur-nish a house com-fort-ably in that re-spect you had on-ly to buy up eight or ten lazy fel-lows and lay them round in the piers and al-coves Be-sides it was very con-ve-nient on an ex-cur-sion much bet-ter than those gar-den chairs which are con-vert-ible in-to walk-ing sticks upon oc-ca-sion a chief calling his at-ten-dant and de-sir-ing him to make a set-tee of him-self un-der a spread-ing tree per-haps in some damp marshy place While nar-rat-ing th-ese things every time Quee-queg re-ceived the tom-a-hawk from me he flour-ished the hatch-et side of it over the sleep-erâ s head â Whatâ s that for Quee-queg â â Per-ry easy kill e oh per-ry easy â He was go-ing on with some wild rem-i-nis-cences about his tom-a-hawk pipe which it seemed had in its two us-es both brained his foes and soothed his soul when we were direct-ly at-tract-ed to the sleep-ing rig-ger The strong va-por now com-plete-ly filling the con-tract-ed hole it be-gan to tell upon him He breathed with a sort of muf-fled-ness then seemed trou-bled in the nose then re-volved over once or twice then sat up and rubbed his eyes â Hol-loa â he breathed at last â who be ye smok-ers â â Shipped men â an-swered I â when does she sail â â Aye aye ye are go-ing in her be ye She sails to day The Cap-tain came aboard last night â â What Cap-tain â Ahab â â Who but him in-deed â I was go-ing to ask him some fur-ther ques-tions con-cern-ing Ahab when we heard a noise on deck â Hol-loa Star-buckâ s astir â said the rig-ger â Heâ s a live-ly chief mate that good man and a pious but all alive now I must turn to â And so say-ing he went on deck and we fol-lowed It was now clear sun-rise Soon the crew came on board in twos and threes the rig-gers be-stirred them-selves the mates were ac-tive-ly en-gaged and sev-er-al of the shore peo-ple were busy in bring-ing var-i-ous last things on board Mean-while Cap-tain Ahab re-mained in-vis-i-bly en-shrined within his cabin CHAPTER 22 Mer-ry Christ-mas At length towards noon upon the fi-nal dis-missal of the shipâ s rig-gers and after the Pe-quod had been hauled out from the wharf and after the ever thought-ful Char-i-ty had come off in a whale boat with her last giftâ a night cap for Stubb the se-cond mate her brother in law and a spare Bi-ble for the ste-wardâ after all this the two Cap-tains Pe-leg and Bil-dad is-sued from the cabin and turn-ing to the chief mate Pe-leg said â Now Mr Star-buck are you sure every-thing is right Cap-tain Ahab is all readyâ just spoke to himâ noth-ing more to be got from shore eh Well call all hands then Muster â em aft hereâ blast â em â â No need of pro-fane words how-ev-er great the hur-ry Pe-leg â said Bil-dad â but away with thee friend Star-buck and do our bid-ding â How now Here upon the very point of start-ing for the voy-age Cap-tain Pe-leg and Cap-tain Bil-dad were go-ing it with a high hand on the quar-ter deck just as if they were to be joint com-man-ders at sea as well as to all ap-pear-ances in port And as for Cap-tain Ahab no sign of him was yet to be seen on-ly they said he was in the cabin But then the idea was that his pres-ence was by no means ne-c-es-sary in get-ting the ship un-der weigh and steer-ing her well out to sea In-deed as that was not at all his prop-er busi-ness but the pilotâ s and as he was not yet com-plete-ly re-cov-eredâ so they saidâ there-fore Cap-tain Ahab stayed below And all this seemed nat-u-ral enough espe-cial-ly as in the mer-chant ser-vice many cap-tains nev-er show them-selves on deck for a con-sid-er-able time after heav-ing up the an-chor but re-main over the cabin table hav-ing a farewell mer-ry mak-ing with their shore friends be-fore they quit the ship for good with the pilot But there was not much chance to think over the mat-ter for Cap-tain Pe-leg was now all alive He seemed to do most of the talk-ing and com-mand-ing and not Bil-dad â Aft here ye sons of bach-e-lors â he cried as the sailors lin-gered at the main mast â Mr Star-buck drive â em aft â â Strike the tent there â â was the next order As I hint-ed be-fore this whale-bone mar-quee was nev-er pitched ex-cept in port and on board the Pe-quod for thir-ty years the order to strike the tent was well known to be the next thing to heav-ing up the an-chor â Man the cap-stan Blood and thun-der â jump â â was the next com-mand and the crew sprang for the hand-spikes Now in get-ting un-der weigh the sta-tion gen-er-al-ly oc-cu-pied by the pilot is the for-ward part of the ship And here Bil-dad who with Pe-leg be it known in ad-di-tion to his other of-fi-cers was one of the li-censed pilots of the portâ he be-ing sus-pect-ed to have got him-self made a pilot in order to save the Nan-tuck-et pilot fee to all the ships he was con-cerned in for he nev-er pilot-ed any other craftâ Bil-dad I say might now be seen ac-tive-ly en-gaged in look-ing over the bows for the ap-proach-ing an-chor and at in-ter-vals sing-ing what seemed a dis-mal stave of psalmody to cheer the hands at the wind-lass who roared forth some sort of a cho-rus about the gir-ls in Booble Al-ley with hearty good will Nev-er-the-less not three days pre-vi-ous Bil-dad had told them that no pro-fane songs would be al-lowed on board the Pe-quod par-tic-u-lar-ly in get-ting un-der weigh and Char-i-ty his sis-ter had placed a small choice copy of Wat-ts in each sea-manâ s berth Mean-time oversee-ing the other part of the ship Cap-tain Pe-leg ripped and swore astern in the most fright-ful man-ner I al-most thought he would sink the ship be-fore the an-chor could be got up in-vol-un-tar-i-ly I paused on my hand-spike and told Quee-queg to do the same think-ing of the per-ils we both ran in start-ing on the voy-age with such a devil for a pilot I was com-fort-ing my-self how-ev-er with the thought that in pious Bil-dad might be found some sal-va-tion spite of his seven hun-dred and seven-ty seventh lay when I felt a sud-den sharp poke in my rear and turn-ing round was hor-ri-fied at the ap-pari-tion of Cap-tain Pe-leg in the act of with-draw-ing his leg from my im-me-di-ate vicin-i-ty That was my first kick â Is that the way they heave in the marchant ser-vice â he roared â Spring thou sheep head spring and break thy back-bone Why donâ t ye spring I say all of yeâ spring Quo-hog spring thou chap with the red whiskers spring there Scotch cap spring thou green pan-ts Spring I say all of ye and spring your eyes out â And so say-ing he moved along the wind-lass here and there us-ing his leg very freely while im-per-turbable Bil-dad kept lead-ing off with his psalmody Thinks I Cap-tain Pe-leg must have been drink-ing some-thing to day At last the an-chor was up the sails were set and off we glid-ed It was a short cold Christ-mas and as the short north-ern day merged in-to night we found our-selves al-most broad upon the win-try ocean whose freez-ing spray cased us in ice as in pol-ished ar-mor The long rows of teeth on the bul-warks glis-tened in the moon-light and like the white ivory tusks of some huge ele-phant vast curv-ing ici-cles depend-ed from the bows Lank Bil-dad as pilot head-ed the first watch and ever and anon as the old craft deep dived in-to the green seas and sent the shiver-ing frost all over her and the winds howled and the cordage rang his steady notes were heard â â Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood Stand dressed in liv-ing green So to the Jews old Canaan stood While Jor-dan rolled between â Nev-er did those sweet words sound more sweet-ly to me than then They were full of hope and fruition Spite of this frigid win-ter night in the bois-ter-ous At-lantic spite of my wet feet and wet-ter jack-et there was yet it then seemed to me many a pleas-ant haven in store and meads and glades so eter-nal-ly ver-nal that the grass shot up by the spring un-trod-den un-wilt-ed re-mains at mid-sum-mer At last we gained such an off-ing that the two pilots were need-ed no longer The stout sail boat that had ac-com-pa-nied us be-gan rang-ing along-side It was cu-ri-ous and not un-pleas-ing how Pe-leg and Bil-dad were af-fect-ed at this junc-ture espe-cial-ly Cap-tain Bil-dad For loath to depart yet very loath to leave for good a ship bound on so long and per-ilous a voy-ageâ beyond both stormy Capes a ship in which some thou-sands of his hard earned dol-lars were in-vest-ed a ship in which an old ship-mate sailed as cap-tain a man al-most as old as he once more start-ing to en-counter all the ter-rors of the pi-ti-less jaw loath to say good bye to a thing so every way brim-ful of every in-ter-est to him â poor old Bil-dad lin-gered long paced the deck with anx-ious strides ran down in-to the cabin to speak another farewell word there again came on deck and looked to wind-ward looked towards the wide and end-less waters on-ly bound-ed by the far off unseen Eastern Con-ti-nen-ts looked towards the land looked aloft looked right and left looked every-where and nowhere and at last me-chan-i-cal-ly coil-ing a rope upon its pin con-vul-sive-ly grasped stout Pe-leg by the hand and hold-ing up a lan-tern for a mo-ment stood gaz-ing heroical-ly in his face as much as to say â Nev-er-the-less friend Pe-leg I can stand it yes I can â As for Pe-leg him-self he took it more like a philoso-pher but for all his phi-los-o-phy there was a tear twin-kling in his eye when the lan-tern came too near And he too did not a lit-tle run from cabin to deckâ now a word below and now a word with Star-buck the chief mate But at last he turned to his com-rade with a fi-nal sort of look about him â â Cap-tain Bil-dadâ come old ship-mate we must go Back the main yard there Boat ahoy Stand by to come close along-side now Care-ful care-ful â come Bil-dad boyâ say your last Luck to ye Star-buckâ luck to ye Mr Stub-bâ luck to ye Mr Flaskâ good bye and good luck to ye al-lâ and this day three years Iâ ll have a hot sup-per smok-ing for ye in old Nan-tuck-et Hur-rah and away â â God bless ye and have ye in His holy keep-ing men â mur-mured old Bil-dad al-most in-co-her-ent-ly â I hope yeâ ll have fine weather now so that Cap-tain Ahab may soon be mov-ing among yeâ a pleas-ant sun is all he needs and yeâ ll have plen-ty of them in the trop-ic voy-age ye go Be care-ful in the hunt ye mates Donâ t stave the boats need-less-ly ye har-pooneers good white cedar plank is raised full three per cent within the year Donâ t for-get your pray-ers either Mr Star-buck mind that coop-er donâ t waste the

the mo-lasses tierce Mr Stubb it was a lit-tle leaky I thought If ye touch at the is-lands Mr Flask be-ware of for-ni-ca-tion Good bye good bye Donâ t keep that cheese too long down in the hold Mr Star-buck itâ ll spoil Be care-ful with the but-terâ twen-ty cen-ts the pound it was and mind ye ifâ â â Come come Cap-tain Bil-dad stop palaver-ing â away â and with that Pe-leg hur-ried him over the side and both dropt in-to the boat Ship and boat diverged the cold damp night breeze blew between a scream-ing gull flew over-head the two hul-ls wild-ly rolled we gave three heavy heart-ed cheers and blind-ly plunged like fate in-to the lone At-lantic CHAPTER 23 The Lee Shore Some chap-ters back one Bulk-ing-ton was spo-ken of a tall new-land-ed mariner en-coun-tered in New Bed-ford at the inn When on that shiver-ing win-terâ s night the Pe-quod thrust her vin-dic-tive bows in-to the cold ma-li-cious waves who should I see stand-ing at her helm but Bulk-ing-ton I looked with sym-pa-thet-ic awe and fear-ful-ness upon the man who in mid win-ter just land-ed from a four yearsâ danger-ous voy-age could so un-rest-ing-ly push off again for still another tem-pes-tu-ous term The land seemed scorch-ing to his feet Won-der-fullest things are ever the un-men-tion-able deep me-mories yield no epi-taphs this six inch chap-ter is the stone-less grave of Bulk-ing-ton Let me on-ly say that it fared with him as with the storm tossed ship that mis-er-ably drives along the lee-ward land The port would fain give suc-cor the port is pi-ti-ful in the port is safe-ty com-fort hearth-stone sup-per warm blan-kets friends all thatâ s kind to our mor-tal-i-ties But in that gale the port the land is that shipâ s direst jeop-ardy she must fly all hospi-tal-i-ty one touch of land though it but graze the keel would make her shud-der through and through With all her might she crowds all sail off shore in so do-ing fights â gainst the very winds that fain would blow her home-ward seeks all the lashed seaâ s land-less-ness again for refugeâ s sake for-lorn-ly rush-ing in-to per-il her on-ly friend her bit-ter-est foe Know ye now Bulk-ing-ton Glimpses do ye seem to see of that mor-tal-ly in-tol-er-a-ble truth that all deep earnest think-ing is but the in-trepid ef-fort of the soul to keep the open in-de-pen-dence of her sea while the wildest winds of heav-en and earth con-spire to cast her on the treach-er-ous slav-ish shore But as in land-less-ness alone re-sides high-est truth shore-less in-def-i-nite as Godâ so bet-ter is it to per-ish in that howl-ing in-fi-nite than be in-glo-ri-ous-ly dashed upon the lee even if that were safe-ty For worm like then oh who would craven crawl to land Ter-rors of the ter-ri-ble is all this agony so vain Take heart take heart O Bulk-ing-ton Bear thee grim-ly demigod Up from the spray of thy ocean per-ish-ingâ straight up leaps thy apotheo-sis CHAPTER 24 The Ad-vo-cate As Quee-queg and I are now fair-ly em-barked in this busi-ness of whal-ing and as this busi-ness of whal-ing has some-how come to be re-gard-ed among lands-men as a rather un-po-et-i-cal and dis-rep-utable pur-suit there-fore I am all anx-i-ety to con-vince ye ye lands-men of the in-jus-tice here-by done to us hun-ters of whales In the first place it may be deemed al-most su-per-flu-ous to estab-lish the fact that among peo-ple at large the busi-ness of whal-ing is not ac-count-ed on a lev-el with what are called the lib-er-al pro-fes-sions If a stranger were in-tro-duced in-to any mis-cel-la-neous metropoli-tan so-ci-ety it would but slight-ly ad-vance the gen-er-al opin-ion of his mer-its were he pre-sent-ed to the com-pa-ny as a har-pooneer say and if in emu-la-tion of the naval of-fi-cers he should ap-pend the ini-tials S W F Sperm Whale Fish-ery to his visit-ing card such a pro-ce-dure would be deemed pre emi-nent-ly pre-sum-ing and ridicu-lous Doubt-less one lead-ing rea-son why the world de-clines honor-ing us whale-men is this they think that at best our vo-ca-tion amoun-ts to a butcher-ing sort of busi-ness and that when ac-tive-ly en-gaged there-in we are sur-round-ed by all man-ner of de-file-men-ts Butch-ers we are that is true But butch-ers al-so and butch-ers of the blood-i-est badge have been all Mar-tial Com-man-ders whom the world in-vari-ably de-lights to honor And as for the mat-ter of the al-leged un-clean-li-ness of our busi-ness ye shall soon be ini-ti-at-ed in-to cer-tain fac-ts hither-to pret-ty gen-er-al-ly un-known and which upon the whole will tri-umphant-ly plant the sperm whale ship at least among the clean-li-est things of this tidy earth But even grant-ing the charge in ques-tion to be true what disor-dered slip-pery decks of a whale ship are com-pa-ra-ble to the un-speak-able car-rion of those bat-tle fields from which so many soldiers re-turn to drink in all ladiesâ plau-dits And if the idea of per-il so much en-hances the pop-u-lar con-ceit of the soldierâ s pro-fes-sion let me as-sure ye that many a veter-an who has freely marched up to a bat-tery would quick-ly re-coil at the ap-pari-tion of the sperm whaleâ s vast tail fan-ning in-to ed-dies the air over his head For what are the com-pre-hen-si-ble ter-rors of man com-pared with the in-ter-linked ter-rors and won-ders of God But though the world scouts at us whale hun-ters yet does it un-wit-ting-ly pay us the pro-found-est ho-mage yea an all abound-ing ado-ra-tion for al-most all the tapers lam-ps and can-dles that burn round the globe burn as be-fore so many shrines to our glo-ry But look at this mat-ter in other lights weigh it in all sorts of scales see what we whale-men are and have been Why did the Dutch in De Wit-tâ s time have ad-mi-rals of their whal-ing fleets Why did Louis XVI of France at his own per-son-al ex-pense fit out whal-ing ships from Dunkirk and po-lite-ly in-vite to that town some score or two of fam-i-lies from our own is-land of Nan-tuck-et Why did Bri-tain between the years 175 and 1788 pay to her whale-men in boun-ties up-wards of Â 1   And last-ly how comes it that we whale-men of Amer-i-ca now out-num-ber all the rest of the band-ed whale-men in the world sail a navy of up-wards of seven hun-dred ves-sels manned by eigh-teen thou-sand men year-ly con-sum-ing 4   of dol-lars the ships worth at the time of sail-ing 2   and every year im-port-ing in-to our har-bors a well reaped har-vest of 7   How comes all this if there be not some-thing puis-sant in whal-ing But this is not the half look again I freely assert that the cos-mopo-lite philoso-pher can-not for his life point out one sin-gle peace-ful in-flu-ence which within the last six-ty years has oper-at-ed more po-ten-tial-ly upon the whole broad world tak-en in one ag-gre-gate than the high and mighty busi-ness of whal-ing One way and another it has be-got-ten even-ts so re-mark-able in them-selves and so con-tin-u-ous-ly mo-men-tous in their se-quen-tial is-sues that whal-ing may well be re-gard-ed as that Egyp-tian mother who bore off-spring them-selves preg-nant from her womb It would be a hope-less end-less task to cat-a-logue all th-ese things Let a hand-ful suf-fice For many years past the whale ship has been the pioneer in fer-ret-ing out the re-motest and least known parts of the earth She has ex-plored seas and archipela-goes which had no chart where no Cook or Van-cou-ver had ever sailed If Amer-i-can and Euro-pean men of war now peace-ful-ly ride in once sav-age har-bors let them fire sa-lutes to the honor and glo-ry of the whale ship which orig-i-nal-ly showed them the way and first in-ter-pret-ed between them and the sav-ages They may cel-e-brate as they will the heroes of Ex-plor-ing Ex-pe-di-tions your Cooks your Krusen-sterns but I say that scores of anony-mous Cap-tains have sailed out of Nan-tuck-et that were as great and greater than your Cook and your Krusen-stern For in their suc-cour-less emp-ty hand-ed-ness they in the hea-then-ish sharked waters and by the beach-es of un-record-ed javelin is-lands bat-tled with vir-gin won-ders and ter-rors that Cook with all his marines and mus-kets would not willing-ly have dared All that is made such a flour-ish of in the old South Sea Voy-ages those things were but the life time com-mon-places of our heroic Nan-tuck-eters Often ad-ven-tures which Van-cou-ver ded-i-cates three chap-ters to th-ese men ac-count-ed un-wor-thy of be-ing set down in the shipâ s com-mon log Ah the world Oh the world Un-til the whale fish-ery round-ed Cape Horn no com-merce but colo-nial scarce-ly any in-ter-course but colo-nial was car-ried on between Europe and the long line of the opu-lent Span-ish provinces on the Pa-cif-ic coast It was the whale-man who first broke through the jeal-ous pol-i-cy of the Span-ish crown touch-ing those colonies and if space per-mit-ted it might be distinct-ly shown how from those whale-men at last even-tu-at-ed the lib-er-a-tion of Peru Chili and Bo-livia from the yoke of Old Spain and the estab-lish-ment of the eter-nal democ-ra-cy in those parts That great Amer-i-ca on the other side of the sphere Aus-tralia was giv-en to the en-light-ened world by the whale-man After its first blun-der born dis-cov-ery by a Dutch-man all other ships long shunned those shores as pes-tif-er-ous-ly bar-barous but the whale ship touched there The whale ship is the true mother of that now mighty colony More-over in the in-fan-cy of the first Aus-tralian set-tle-ment the emi-grants were sev-er-al times saved from star-va-tion by the benev-o-lent bis-cuit of the whale ship luck-i-ly drop-ping an an-chor in their waters The un-count-ed isles of all Poly-ne-sia con-fess the same truth and do com-mer-cial ho-mage to the whale ship that cleared the way for the mis-sion-ary and the mer-chant and in many cas-es car-ried the prim-i-tive mis-sion-ar-ies to their first desti-na-tions If that dou-ble bolt-ed land Ja-pan is ever to be-come hospitable it is the whale ship alone to whom the cred-it will be due for al-ready she is on the thresh-old But if in the face of all this you still de-clare that whal-ing has no Ã sthet-i-cal-ly noble as-so-ci-a-tions con-nect-ed with it then am I ready to shiv-er fifty lances with you there and un-horse you with a split hel-met every time The whale has no fa-mous author and whal-ing no fa-mous chron-i-cler you will say The whale no fa-mous author and whal-ing no fa-mous chron-i-cler Who wrote the first ac-count of our Le-viathan Who but mighty Job And who com-posed the first nar-ra-tive of a whal-ing voy-age Who but no less a prince than Al-fred the Great who with his own roy-al pen took down the words from Other the Nor-we-gian whale hunter of those times And who pro-nounced our glow-ing eu-lo-gy in Par-lia-ment Who but Ed-mund Burke True enough but then whale-men them-selves are poor devils they have no good blood in their veins No good blood in their veins They have some-thing bet-ter than roy-al blood there The grand-moth-er of Ben-jamin Franklin was Mary Mor-rel after-wards by mar-riage Mary Fol-ger one of the old set-tlers of Nan-tuck-et and the ances-tress to a long line of Fol-gers and har-pooneer-sâ all kith and kin to noble Ben-jam-inâ this day dart-ing the barbed iron from one side of the world to the other Good again but then all con-fess that some-how whal-ing is not re-spectable Whal-ing not re-spectable Whal-ing is im-pe-ri-al By old English statu-to-ry law the whale is de-clared â a roy-al fish â Oh thatâ s on-ly nom-i-nal The whale him-self has nev-er fig-ured in any grand im-pos-ing way The whale nev-er fig-ured in any grand im-pos-ing way In one of the mighty tri-umphs giv-en to a Ro-man gen-er-al upon his en-ter-ing

more on this head Grant it since you cite it but say what you will there is no real dig-ni-ty in whal-ing No dig-ni-ty in whal-ing The dig-ni-ty of our calling the very heav-ens attest Ce-tus is a con-stel-la-tion in the South No more Drive down your hat in pres-ence of the Czar and take it off to Quee-queg No more I know a man that in his life-time has tak-en three hun-dred and fifty whales I ac-count that man more honor-able than that great cap-tain of an-tiq-ui-ty who boast-ed of tak-ing as many walled towns And as for me if by any pos-si-bil-i-ty there be any as yet undis-cov-ered prime thing in me if I shall ever de-serve any real re-pute in that small but high hushed world which I might not be un-rea-son-ably am-bi-tious of if hereafter I shall do any-thing that upon the whole a man might rather have done than to have left un-done if at my death my ex-ecu-tors or more prop-er-ly my cred-i-tors find any pre-cious MSS in my desk then here I prospec-tive-ly ascribe all the honor and the glo-ry to whal-ing for a whale ship was my Yale Col-lege and my Har-vard CHAPTER 25 Postscript In be-half of the dig-ni-ty of whal-ing I would fain ad-vance naught but sub-stan-ti-at-ed fac-ts But after em-bat-tling his fac-ts an ad-vo-cate who should whol-ly sup-press a not un-rea-son-able sur-mise which might tell elo-quent-ly upon his causeâ such an ad-vo-cate would he not be blame-wor-thy It is well known that at the corona-tion of kings and queens even modern ones a cer-tain cu-ri-ous pro-cess of sea-son-ing them for their func-tions is gone through There is a salt-cel-lar of state so called and there may be a cas-tor of state How they use the salt pre-cise-lyâ who knows Cer-tain I am how-ev-er that a kingâ s head is solemn-ly oiled at his corona-tion even as a head of sal-ad Can it be though that they anoint it with a view of mak-ing its in-te-ri-or run well as they anoint machin-ery Much might be ru-mi-nat-ed here con-cern-ing the essen-tial dig-ni-ty of this re-gal pro-cess be-cause in com-mon life we es-teem but mean-ly and con-temptibly a fel-low who anoin-ts his hair and pal-pa-bly smel-ls of that anoint-ing In truth a ma-ture man who us-es hair oil un-less medic-i-nal-ly that man has prob-a-bly got a quog-gy spot in him some-where As a gen-er-al rule he canâ t amount to much in his to-tal-i-ty But the on-ly thing to be con-sid-ered here is thisâ what kind of oil is used at corona-tions Cer-tain-ly it can-not be olive oil nor ma-cas-sar oil nor cas-tor oil nor bearâ s oil nor train oil nor cod liv-er oil What then can it pos-si-bly be but sperm oil in its un-man-u-fac-tured un-pol-lut-ed state the sweet-est of all oils Think of that ye loy-al Bri-tons we whale-men sup-ply your kings and queens with corona-tion stuff CHAPTER 26 Knights and Squires The chief mate of the Pe-quod was Star-buck a na-tive of Nan-tuck-et and a Quak-er by des-cent He was a long earnest man and though born on an icy coast seemed well adapt-ed to en-dure hot lat-i-tudes his flesh be-ing hard as twice baked bis-cuit Trans-port-ed to the Indies his live blood would not spoil like bot-tled ale He must have been born in some time of gen-er-al drought and famine or upon one of those fast days for which his state is fa-mous On-ly some thir-ty arid sum-mers had he seen those sum-mers had dried up all his phys-i-cal su-per-flu-ous-ness But this his thin-ness so to speak seemed no more the to-ken of wast-ing anx-i-eties and cares than it seemed the indi-ca-tion of any bodi-ly blight It was mere-ly the con-den-sa-tion of the man He was by no means ill look-ing quite the con-trary His pure tight skin was an ex-cel-lent fit and close-ly wrapped up in it and em-balmed with in-ner health and strength like a re-viv-i-fied Egyp-tian this Star-buck seemed pre-pared to en-dure for long ages to come and to en-dure al-ways as now for be it Po-lar snow or tor-rid sun like a pa-tent chronome-ter his in-te-ri-or vi-tal-i-ty was war-rant-ed to do well in all cli-mates Look-ing in-to his eyes you seemed to see there the yet lin-ger-ing images of those thou-sand fold per-ils he had calm-ly con-front-ed through life A staid stead-fast man whose life for the most part was a telling pan-tomime of ac-tion and not a tame chap-ter of sounds Yet for all his hardy so-bri-ety and for-ti-tude there were cer-tain qual-i-ties in him which at times af-fect-ed and in some cas-es seemed well nigh to over-bal-ance all the rest Un-com-mon-ly con-sci-en-tious for a sea-man and en-dued with a deep nat-u-ral rev-er-ence the wild watery lone-li-ness of his life did there-fore strong-ly in-cline him to su-per-sti-tion but to that sort of su-per-sti-tion which in some or-ga-ni-za-tions seems rather to spring some-how from in-tel-li-gence than from ig-no-rance Out-ward por-ten-ts and in-ward pre-sen-ti-men-ts were his And if at times th-ese things bent the weld-ed iron of his soul much more did his far away do-mes-tic me-mories of his young Cape wife and child tend to bend him still more from the orig-i-nal rugged-ness of his na-ture and open him still fur-ther to those la-tent in-flu-ences which in some hon-est heart-ed men res-train the gush of dare devil dar-ing so often evinced by others in the more per-ilous vi-cis-si-tudes of the fish-ery â I will have no man in my boat â said Star-buck â who is not afraid of a whale â By this he seemed to mean not on-ly that the most reli-able and use-ful courage was that which aris-es from the fair es-ti-ma-tion of the en-coun-tered per-il but that an ut-ter-ly fear-less man is a far more danger-ous com-rade than a coward â Aye aye â said Stubb the se-cond mate â Star-buck there is as care-ful a man as youâ ll find any-where in this fish-ery â But we shall ere long see what that word â care-fulâ pre-cise-ly means when used by a man like Stubb or al-most any other whale hunter Star-buck was no cru-sad-er after per-ils in him courage was not a sen-ti-ment but a thing sim-ply use-ful to him and al-ways at hand upon all mor-tal-ly prac-ti-cal oc-ca-sions Be-sides he thought per-haps that in this busi-ness of whal-ing courage was one of the great sta-ple out-fits of the ship like her beef and her bread and not to be fool-ish-ly wast-ed Where-fore he had no fan-cy for low-er-ing for whales after sun down nor for per-sist-ing in fight-ing a fish that too much per-sist-ed in fight-ing him For thought Star-buck I am here in this crit-i-cal ocean to kill whales for my liv-ing and not to be killed by them for theirs and that hun-dreds of men had been so killed Star-buck well knew What doom was his own fatherâ s Where in the bot-tom-less deeps could he find the torn lim-bs of his brother With me-mories like th-ese in him and more-over giv-en to a cer-tain su-per-sti-tious-ness as has been said the courage of this Star-buck which could nev-er-the-less still flour-ish must in-deed have been ex-treme But it was not in rea-son-able na-ture that a man so or-ga-nized and with such ter-ri-ble ex-pe-ri-ences and re-mem-brances as he had it was not in na-ture that th-ese things should fail in la-tent-ly en-gen-der-ing an ele-ment in him which un-der suitable cir-cum-stances would break out from its con-fine-ment and burn all his courage up And brave as he might be it was that sort of brav-ery chiefly vis-i-ble in some in-trepid men which while gen-er-al-ly abid-ing firm in the con-flict with seas or winds or whales or any of the or-di-nary ir-ra-tional hor-rors of the world yet can-not with-stand those more ter-rif-ic be-cause more spir-i-tu-al ter-rors which some-times me-nace you from the con-cen-trat-ing brow of an en-raged and mighty man But were the com-ing nar-ra-tive to re-veal in any in-stance the com-plete abase-ment of poor Star-buckâ s for-ti-tude scarce might I have the heart to write it for it is a thing most sor-row-ful nay shock-ing to ex-pose the fall of valour in the soul Men may seem detestable as joint stock com-pa-nies and na-tions knaves fools and mur-der-ers there may be men may have mean and mea-gre faces but man in the ideal is so noble and so sparkling such a grand and glow-ing crea-ture that over any ig-no-min-ious blem-ish in him all his fel-lows should run to throw their costli-est robes That im-mac-u-late man-li-ness we feel within our-selves so far within us that it re-mains in-tact though all the outer char-ac-ter seem gone bleeds with keen-est an-guish at the un-draped spec-ta-cle of a valor ruined man Nor can pi-ety it-self at such a shame-ful sight com-plete-ly sti-fle her up-braid-ings against the per-mit-ting stars But this au-gust dig-ni-ty I treat of is not the dig-ni-ty of kings and robes but that abound-ing dig-ni-ty which has no robed in-vesti-ture Thou shalt see it shin-ing in the arm that wields a pick or drives a spike that demo-crat-ic dig-ni-ty which on all hands ra-di-ates without end from God Him-self The great God ab-so-lute The cen-tre and cir-cum-fer-ence of all democ-ra-cy His om-nipres-ence our divine equal-i-ty If then to mean-est mariners and rene-gades and cast-aways I shall hereafter ascribe high qual-i-ties though dark weave round them trag-ic graces if even the most mourn-ful per-chance the most abased among them all shall at times lift him-self to the ex-alt-ed moun-ts if I shall touch that work-manâ s arm with some ethe-re-al light if I shall spread a rain-bow over his disas-trous set of sun then against all mor-tal crit-ics bear me out in it thou just Spir-it of Equal-i-ty which hast spread one roy-al man-tle of hu-man-i-ty over all my kind Bear me out in it thou great demo-crat-ic God who didst not refuse to the swart con-vict Bun-yan the pale poet-ic pearl Thou who didst clothe with dou-bly ham-mered leaves of finest gold the stumped and pau-pered arm of old Cer-vantes Thou who didst pick up An-drew Jack-son from the peb-bles who didst hurl him upon a war horse who didst thun-der him higher than a throne Thou who in all Thy mighty earth-ly march-ings ever cullest Thy selectest cham-pi-ons from the king-ly com-mons bear me out in it O God CHAPTER 27 Knights and Squires Stubb was the se-cond mate He was a na-tive of Cape Cod and hence ac-cord-ing to lo-cal usage was called a Cape Cod man A hap-py go lucky nei-ther craven nor valiant tak-ing per-ils as they came with an in-dif-fer-ent air and while en-gaged in the most im-mi-nent cri-sis of the chase toil-ing away calm and col-lect-ed as a jour-ney-man join-er en-gaged for the year Good hu-mored easy and care-less he presid-ed over his whale boat as if the most dead-ly en-counter were but a din-ner and his crew all in-vit-ed guests He was as par-tic-u-lar about the com-fort-able ar-range-ment of his part of the boat as an old stage driv-er is about the snug-ness of his box When close to the whale in the very death lock of the fight he han-dled his un-pity-ing lance cool-ly and off hand-ed-ly as a whistling tinker his ham-mer He would hum over his old ri-gadig tunes while flank and flank with the most ex-as-per-at-ed mon-ster Long usage had for this Stubb con-vert-ed the jaws of death in-to an easy chair What he thought of death it-self there is no telling Whether he ever thought of it at all might be a ques-tion but if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after a com-fort-able din-ner no doubt like a good sailor he took it to be a sort of call of the watch to tum-ble aloft and be-stir them-selves there about some-thing which he would find out when he obeyed the order and not soon-er What per-haps with other things made Stubb such an easy go-ing un-fear-ing man so cheer-i-ly trudg-ing off with the bur-den of life in a world full of grave ped-lars all bowed to the ground with their packs what helped to bring about that al-most im-pi-ous good hu-mor of his that thing must have been his pipe For like his nose his short black lit-tle pipe was one of the reg-u-lar fea-tures of his face You would al-most as soon have ex-pect-ed him to turn out of his bunk without his nose as without his pipe He kept a whole row of pipes there ready load-ed stuck in a rack within easy reach of his hand and when-ev-er he turned in he smoked them all out in suc-ces-sion light-ing one from the other to the end of the chap-ter then load-ing them again to be in readi-ness anew For when Stubb dressed in-stead of first put-ting his legs in-to his trowsers he put his pipe in-to his mouth I say this con-tin-u-al smok-ing must have been one cause at least of his pe-cu-liar dis-po-si-tion for every one knows that this earth-ly air whether ashore or afloat is ter-ri-bly in-fect-ed with the name-less mis-eries of the num-ber-less mor-tals who have died ex-hal-ing it and as in time of the cholera some peo-ple go about with a cam-phor-at-ed hand-ker-chief to their mouths so like-wise against all mor-tal tribu-la-tions Stub-bâ s tobac-co smoke might have oper-at-ed as a sort of dis-in-fect-ing agent The third mate was Flask a na-tive of Tis-bury in Marthaâ s Vine-yard A short stout rud-dy young fel-low very pug-na-cious con-cern-ing whales who some-how seemed to think that the great le-viathans had per-son-al-ly and hered-i-tar-i-ly af-front-ed him and there-fore it was a sort of point of honor with him to de-stroy them when-ev-er en-coun-tered So ut-ter-ly lost was he to all sense of rev-er-ence for the many marvels of their ma-jes-tic bulk and mys-tic ways and so dead to any-thing like an ap-pre-hen-sion of any pos-si-ble danger from en-coun-ter-ing them that in his poor opin-ion the won-drous whale was but a species of mag-ni-fied mouse or at least water rat re-quir-ing on-ly a lit-tle cir-cum-ven-tion and some small ap-pli-ca-tion of time and trou-ble in order to kill and boil This ig-no-rant un-con-scious fear-less-ness of his made him a lit-tle wag-gish in the mat-ter of whales he fol-lowed th-ese fish for the fun of it and a three yearsâ voy-age round Cape Horn was on-ly a jol-ly joke that last-ed that length of time As a car-pen-terâ s nails are di-vid-ed in-to wrought nails and cut nails so mankind may be sim-i-lar-ly di-vid-ed Lit-tle Flask was one of the wrought ones made to clinch tight and last long They called him King Post on board of the Pe-quod be-cause in form he could be well likened to the short square tim-ber known by that name in Arc-tic whalers and which by the means of many ra-di-at-ing side tim-bers insert-ed in-to it serves to brace the ship against the icy con-cus-sions of those bat-ter-ing seas Now th-ese three matesâ Star-buck Stubb and Flask were mo-men-tous men They it was who by univer-sal pre-scrip-tion com-mand-ed three of the Pe-quodâ s boats as heads-men In that grand order of bat-tle in which Cap-tain Ahab would prob-a-bly mar-shal his forces to descend on the whales th-ese three heads-men were as cap-tains of com-pa-nies Or be-ing armed with their long keen whal-ing spears they were as a picked trio of lancers even as the har-pooneers were flingers of javelins And since in this fa-mous fish-ery each mate or heads-man like a Goth-ic Knight of old is al-ways ac-com-pa-nied by his boat steerer or har-pooneer who in cer-tain con-junc-tures pro-vides him with a fresh lance when the former one has been bad-ly twist-ed or el-bowed in the as-sault and more-over as there gen-er-al-ly sub-sists between the two a close in-ti-ma-cy and friend-li-ness it is there-fore but meet that in this place we set down who the Pe-quodâ s har-pooneers were and to what heads-man each of them be-longed First of all was Quee-queg whom Star-buck the chief mate had select-ed for his squire But Quee-queg is al-ready known Next was Tashtego an un-mixed In-di-an from Gay Head the most wester-ly promon-to-ry of Marthaâ s Vine-yard where there still ex-ists the last rem-nant of a vil-lage of red men which has long sup-plied the neigh-bor-ing is-land of Nan-tuck-et with many of her most dar-ing har-pooneers In the fish-ery they usu-al-ly go by the gener-ic name of Gay Head-ers Tashte-goâ s long lean sable hair his high cheek bones and black round-ing eyesâ for an In-di-an Ori-en-tal in their lar-ge-ness but Antarc-tic in their glit-ter-ing ex-pres-sionâ all this suf-fi-cient-ly pro-claimed him an in-her-i-tor of the unvi-ti-at-ed blood of those proud war-rior hun-ters who in quest of the great New Eng-land moose had scoured bow in hand the abo-rig-i-nal forests of the main But no longer snuff-ing in the trail of the wild beasts of the wood-land Tashtego now hunt-ed in the wake of the great whales of the sea the un-erring har-poon of the son fit-ly re-plac-ing the in-fal-li-ble ar-row of the sires To look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky lim-bs you would al-most have cred-it-ed the su-per-sti-tions of some of the ear-li-er Pu-ri-tans and half believed this wild In-di-an to be a son of the Prince of the Pow-ers of the Air Tashtego was Stubb the se-cond mateâ s squire Third among the har-pooneers was Dag-goo a gi-gan-tic coal black ne-gro sav-age with a lion like treadâ an Aha-suerus to be-hold Sus-pend-ed from his ears were two gold-en hoops so large that the sailors called them ring bolts and would talk of se-cur-ing the top sail hal-yards to them In his youth Dag-goo had vol-un-tar-i-ly shipped on board of a whaler ly-ing in a lone-ly bay on his na-tive coast And nev-er hav-ing been any-where in the world but in Africa Nan-tuck-et and the pa-gan har-bors most fre-quent-ed by whale-men and hav-ing now led for many years the bold life of the fish-ery in the ships of own-ers un-com-mon-ly heed-ful of what man-ner of men they shipped Dag-goo re-tained all his bar-bar-ic virtues and erect as a gi-raffe moved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet five in his socks There was a cor-po-re-al hu-mil-i-ty in look-ing up at him and a white man stand-ing be-fore him seemed a white flag come to beg truce of a fortress Cu-ri-ous to tell this im-pe-ri-al ne-gro Aha-suerus Dag-goo was the Squire of lit-tle Flask who looked like a chess man be-side him As for the residue of the Pe-quodâ s com-pa-ny be it said that at the pre-sent day not one in two of the many thou-sand men be-fore the mast em-ployed in the Amer-i-can whale fish-ery are Amer-i-cans born though pret-ty near-ly all the of-fi-cers are Here-in it is the same with the Amer-i-can whale fish-ery as with the Amer-i-can army and mil-i-tary and mer-chant navies and the engi-neer-ing forces em-ployed in the con-struc-tion of the Amer-i-can Canals and Rail-roads The same I say be-cause in all th-ese cas-es the na-tive Amer-i-can lib-er-al-ly pro-vides the brains the rest of the world as gen-er-ous-ly sup-ply-ing the mus-cles No small num-ber of th-ese whal-ing sea-men be-long to the Azores where the out-ward bound Nan-tuck-et whalers fre-quent-ly touch to aug-ment their crews from the hardy peas-an-ts of those rocky shores In like man-ner the Green-land whalers sail-ing out of Hull or Lon-don put in at the Shet-land Is-lands to re-ceive the full com-ple-ment of their crew Upon the pas-sage home-wards they drop them there again How it is there is no telling but Is-lan-ders seem to make the best whale-men They were near-ly all Is-lan-ders in the Pe-quod Iso-la-toes too I call such not ac-knowl-edg-ing the com-mon con-ti-nent of men but each Iso-la-to liv-ing on a separate con-ti-nent of his own Yet now fed-er-at-ed along one keel what a set th-ese Iso-la-toes were An Anachar-sis Clootz dep-u-ta-tion from all the isles of the sea and all the ends of the earth ac-com-pa-ny-ing Old Ahab in the Pe-quod to lay the worldâ s grievances be-fore that bar from which not very many of them ever come back Black Lit-tle Pipâ he nev-er didâ oh no he went be-fore Poor Alaba-ma boy On the grim Pe-quodâ s fore-cas-tle ye shall ere long see him beat-ing his tam-bourine pre-lu-sive of the eter-nal time when sent for to the great quar-ter deck on high he was bid strike in with an-gels and beat his tam-bourine in glo-ry called a coward here hailed a hero there CHAPTER 28 Ahab For sev-er-al days after leav-ing Nan-tuck-et noth-ing above hatch-es was seen of Cap-tain Ahab The mates reg-u-lar-ly relieved each other at the watch-es and for aught that could be seen to the con-trary they seemed to be the on-ly com-man-ders of the ship on-ly they some-times is-sued from the cabin with orders so sud-den and peremp-to-ry that after all it was plain they but com-mand-ed vi-car-i-ous-ly Yes their supreme lord and dic-ta-tor was there though hither-to unseen by any eyes not per-mit-ted to pen-e-trate in-to the now sa-cred re-treat of the cabin Every time I as-cend-ed to the deck from my watch-es below I in-stant-ly gazed aft to mark if any strange face were vis-i-ble for my first vague disqui-etude touch-ing the un-known cap-tain now in the seclu-sion of the sea be-came al-most a per-tur-ba-tion This was strange-ly height-ened at times by the ragged Eli-jahâ s di-abol-i-cal in-co-her-ences un-in-vit-ed-ly re-cur-ring to me with a sub-tle en-er-gy I could not have be-fore con-ceived of But poor-ly could I with-stand them much as in other moods I was al-most ready to smile at the solemn whim-si-cal-i-ties of that out-landish prophet of the wharves But what-ev-er it was of ap-pre-hen-sive-ness or uneasi-nessâ to call it soâ which I felt yet when-ev-er I came to look about me in the ship it seemed against all war-rantry to cher-ish such emo-tions For though the har-pooneers with the great body of the crew were a far more bar-bar-ic hea-then-ish and mot-ley set than any of the tame mer-chant ship com-pa-nies which my pre-vi-ous ex-pe-ri-ences had made me ac-quaint-ed with still I ascribed thisâ and right-ly ascribed itâ to the fierce unique-ness of the very na-ture of that wild Scan-di-na-vian vo-ca-tion in which I had so aban-doned-ly em-barked But it was espe-cial-ly the aspect of the three chief of-fi-cers of the ship the mates which was most forcibly cal-cu-lat-ed to al-lay th-ese colour-less mis-giv-ings and in-duce con-fi-dence and cheer-ful-ness in every pre-sent-ment of the voy-age Three bet-ter more like-ly sea of-fi-cers and men each in his own dif-fer-ent way could not read-i-ly be found and they were every one of them Amer-i-cans a Nan-tuck-eter a Vine-yarder a Cape man Now it be-ing Christ-mas when the ship shot from out her har-bor for a space we had bit-ing Po-lar weather though all the time run-ning away from it to the south-ward and by every de-gree and minute of lat-i-tude which we sailed grad-u-al-ly leav-ing that mer-ci-less win-ter and all its in-tol-er-a-ble weather be-hind us It was one of those less low-er-ing but still grey and gloomy enough morn-ings of the tran-si-tion when with a fair wind the ship was rush-ing through the water with a vin-dic-tive sort of leap-ing and me-lan-choly ra-pid-i-ty that as I mount-ed to the deck at the call of the forenoon watch so soon as I lev-elled my glance towards the taf-frail fore-bod-ing shivers ran over me Real-i-ty ou-tran ap-pre-hen-sion Cap-tain Ahab stood upon his quar-ter deck There seemed no sign of com-mon bodi-ly ill-ness about him nor of the re-cov-ery from any He looked like a man cut away from the stake when the fire has over-run-ning-ly wast-ed all the lim-bs without con-sum-ing them or tak-ing away one par-ti-cle from their com-pact-ed aged ro-bust-ness His whole high broad form seemed made of sol-id bronze and shaped in an unal-ter-able mould like Celliniâ s cast Perseus Thread-ing its way out from among his grey hairs and con-tin-u-ing right down one side of his tawny scorched face and neck till it dis-ap-peared in his cloth-ing you saw a slen-der rod like mark livid-ly whi-tish It re-sem-bled that per-pen-dic-u-lar seam some-times made in the straight lofty trunk of a great tree when the up-per light-ning tear-ing-ly darts down it and without wrench-ing a sin-gle twig peels and grooves out the bark from top to bot-tom ere run-ning off in-to the soil leav-ing the tree still green-ly alive but brand-ed Whether that mark was born with him or whether it was the scar left by some des-per-ate wound no one could cer-tain-ly say By some tac-it con-sent through-out the voy-age lit-tle or no al-lu-sion was made to it espe-cial-ly by the mates But once Tashte-goâ s se-nior an old Gay Head In-di-an among the crew su-per-sti-tious-ly assert-ed that not till he was full forty years old did Ahab be-come that way brand-ed and then it came upon him not in the fury of any mor-tal fray but in an ele-men-tal strife at sea Yet this wild hint seemed in-fer-en-tial-ly nega-tived by what a grey Manx-man insin-u-at-ed an old sepul-chral man who hav-ing nev-er be-fore sailed out of Nan-tuck-et had nev-er ere this laid eye upon wild Ahab Nev-er-the-less the old sea tra-di-tions the im-memo-ri-al creduli-ties pop-u-lar-ly in-vest-ed this old Manx-man with preter-nat-u-ral pow-ers of dis-cern-ment So that no white sailor se-ri-ous-ly con-tra-dict-ed him when he said that if ever Cap-tain Ahab should be tran-quil-ly laid outâ which might hard-ly come to pass so he mut-teredâ then who-ev-er should do that last of-fice for the dead would find a birth mark on him from crown to sole So pow-er-ful-ly did the whole grim aspect of Ahab af-fect me and the livid brand which streaked it that for the first few mo-men-ts I hard-ly not-ed that not a lit-tle of this over-bear-ing grim-ness was owing to the bar-bar-ic white leg upon which he part-ly stood It had pre-vi-ous-ly come to me that this ivory leg had at sea been fash-ioned from the pol-ished bone of the sperm whaleâ s jaw â Aye he was dis-mast-ed off Ja-pan â said the old Gay Head In-di-an once â but like his dis-mast-ed craft he shipped another mast without com-ing home for it He has a quiver of â em â I was struck with the sin-gu-lar pos-ture he main-tained Upon each side of the Pe-quodâ s quar-ter deck and pret-ty close to the mizzen shrouds there was an auger hole bored about half an inch or so in-to the plank His bone leg stead-ied in that hole one arm el-e-vat-ed and hold-ing by a shroud Cap-tain Ahab stood erect look-ing straight out beyond the shipâ s ever pitch-ing prow There was an in-fin-i-ty of firmest for-ti-tude a deter-mi-nate un-sur-ren-der-able wil-ful-ness in the fixed and fear-less for-ward ded-i-ca-tion of that glance Not a word he spoke nor did his of-fi-cers say aught to him though by all their min-utest ges-tures and ex-pres-sions they plain-ly showed the uneasy if not pain-ful con-scious-ness of be-ing un-der a trou-bled master eye And not on-ly that but moody strick-en Ahab stood be-fore them with a cru-ci-fix-ion in his face in all the name-less re-gal over-bear-ing dig-ni-ty of some mighty woe Ere long from his first visit in the air he with-drew in-to his cabin But after that morn-ing he was every day vis-i-ble to the crew either stand-ing in his piv-ot hole or seat-ed upon an ivory stool he had or heav-i-ly walk-ing the deck As the sky grew less gloomy in-deed be-gan to grow a lit-tle ge-nial he be-came still less and less a recluse as if when the ship had sailed from home noth-ing but the dead win-try bleak-ness of the sea had then kept him so se-clud-ed And by and by it came to pass that he was al-most con-tin-u-al-ly in the air but as yet for all that he said or per-cep-ti-bly did on the at last sun-ny deck he seemed as un-nec-es-sary there as another mast But the Pe-quod was on-ly mak-ing a pas-sage now not reg-u-lar-ly cruis-ing near-ly all whal-ing prepar-a-tives need-ing su-per-vi-sion the mates were ful-ly com-pe-tent to so that there was lit-tle or noth-ing out of him-self to em-ploy or ex-cite Ahab now and thus chase away for that one in-ter-val the clouds that lay-er upon lay-er were piled upon his brow as ever all clouds choose the lofti-est peaks to pile them-selves upon Nev-er-the-less ere long the warm war-bling per-sua-sive-ness of the pleas-ant hol-i-day weather we came to seemed grad-u-al-ly to charm him from his mood For as when the red cheeked danc-ing gir-ls April and May trip home to the win-try misan-throp-ic woods even the barest ruggedest most thun-der cloven old oak will at least send forth some few green sprouts to wel-come such glad heart-ed visi-tan-ts so Ahab did in the end a lit-tle re-spond to the play-ful al-lur-ings of that girl-ish air More than once did he put forth the faint blos-som of a look which in any other man would have soon flow-ered out in a smile CHAPTER 29 En-ter Ahab to Him Stubb Some days elapsed and ice and ice-bergs all astern the Pe-quod now went rolling through the bright Quito spring which at sea al-most per-pet-u-al-ly reigns on the thresh-old of the eter-nal Au-gust of the Trop-ic The warm-ly cool clear ring-ing per-fumed over-flow-ing re-dun-dant days were as crys-tal goblets of Per-sian sher-bet heaped upâ flaked up with rose water snow The starred and state-ly nights seemed haughty dames in jewelled vel-vets nurs-ing at home in lone-ly pride the me-mory of their ab-sent con-quer-ing Ear-ls the gold-en hel-met-ed suns For sleep-ing man â twas hard to choose between such win-some days and such se-duc-ing nights But all the witcheries of that un-wan-ing weather did not mere-ly lend new spel-ls and po-ten-cies to the out-ward world In-ward they turned upon the soul espe-cial-ly when the still mild hours of eve came on then me-mory shot her crys-tals as the clear ice most for-ms of noise-less twi-lights And all th-ese sub-tle agen-cies more and more they wrought on Ahabâ s tex-ture Old age is al-ways wake-ful as if the longer linked with life the less man has to do with aught that looks like death Among sea com-man-ders the old grey-beards will often-est leave their berths to visit the night cloaked deck It was so with Ahab on-ly that now of late he seemed so much to live in the open air that tru-ly speak-ing his visits were more to the cabin than from the cabin to the planks â It feels like go-ing down in-to oneâ s tomb â â he would mut-ter to him-selfâ â for an old cap-tain like me to be descend-ing this nar-row scut-tle to go to my grave dug berth â So al-most every twen-ty four hours when the watch-es of the night were set and the band on deck sen-tinelled the slum-bers of the band below and when if a rope was to be hauled upon the fore-cas-tle the sailors flung it not rude-ly down as by day but with some cau-tious-ness dropt it to its place for fear of dis-turb-ing their slum-ber-ing ship-mates when this sort of steady qui-etude would be-gin to pre-vail ha-bit-u-al-ly the si-lent steers-man would watch the cabin scut-tle and ere long the old man would emerge grip-ping at the iron banis-ter to help his crip-pled way Some con-sid-er-ing touch of hu-man-i-ty was in him for at times like th-ese he usu-al-ly ab-stained from pa-trolling the quar-ter deck be-cause to his wearied mates seek-ing re-pose within six inch-es of his ivory heel such would have been the re-ver-ber-at-ing crack and din of that bony step that their dreams would have been on the crunch-ing teeth of sharks But once the mood was on him too deep for com-mon re-gard-ings and as with heavy lum-ber like pace he was mea-sur-ing the ship from taf-frail to main-mast Stubb the old se-cond mate came up from below with a cer-tain unas-sured dep-re-cat-ing hu-mor-ous-ness hint-ed that if Cap-tain Ahab was pleased to walk the planks then no one could say nay but there might be some way of muf-fling the noise hint-ing some-thing indis-tinct-ly and he-si-tat-ing-ly about a globe of tow and the inser-tion in-to it of the ivory heel Ah Stubb thou didst not know Ahab then â Am I a can-non ball Stubb â said Ahab â that thou wouldst wad me that fash-ion But go thy ways I had for-got Below to thy night-ly grave where such as ye sleep between shrouds to use ye to the filling one at last â Down dog and ken-nel â Start-ing at the un-forseen con-clud-ing ex-cla-ma-tion of the so sud-den-ly scorn-ful old man Stubb was speech-less a mo-ment then said ex-cit-ed-ly â I am not used to be spo-ken to that way sir I do but less than half like it sir â â Avast grit-ted Ahab between his set teeth and vi-o-lent-ly mov-ing away as if to avoid some pas-sion-ate temp-ta-tion â No sir not yet â said Stubb em-bold-ened â I will not tame-ly be called a dog sir â â Then be called ten times a don-key and a mule and an ass and be-gone or Iâ ll clear the world of thee â As he said this Ahab ad-vanced upon him with such over-bear-ing ter-rors in his aspect that Stubb in-vol-un-tar-i-ly re-treat-ed â I was nev-er served so be-fore without giv-ing a hard blow for it â mut-tered Stubb as he found him-self descend-ing the cabin scut-tle â Itâ s very queer Stop Stubb some-how now I donâ t well know whether to go back and strike him orâ whatâ s that â down here on my knees and pray for him Yes that was the thought com-ing up in me but it would be the first time I ever did pray Itâ s queer very queer and heâ s queer too aye take him fore and aft heâ s about the queer-est old man Stubb ever sailed with How he flashed at me â his eyes like pow-der pans is he mad Any-way thereâ s some-thing on his mind as sure as there must be some-thing on a deck when it cracks He aint in his bed now either more than three hours out of the twen-ty four and he donâ t sleep then Did-nâ t that Dough Boy the ste-ward tell me that of a morn-ing he al-ways finds the old manâ s ham-mock clothes all rumpled and tum-bled and the sheets down at the foot and the cover-lid al-most tied in-to knots and the pil-low a sort of fright-ful hot as though a baked brick had been on it A hot old man I guess heâ s got what some folks ashore call a con-science itâ s a kind of Tic Dol-ly row they sayâ worse nor a toothache Well well I donâ t know what it is but the Lord keep me from catch-ing it Heâ s full of rid-dles I won-der what he goes in-to the after hold for every night as Dough Boy tel-ls me he sus-pec-ts whatâ s that for I should like to know Whoâ s made ap-point-men-ts with him in the hold Ainâ t that queer now But thereâ s no telling itâ s the old gameâ Here goes for a snooze Damn me itâ s worth a fel-lowâ s while to be born in-to the world if on-ly to fall right asleep And now that I think of it thatâ s about the first thing ba-bies do and thatâ s a sort of queer too Damn me but all things are queer come to think of â em But thatâ s against my prin-ci-ples Think not is my eleventh com-mand-ment and sleep when you can is my twelfthâ So here goes again But howâ s that did-nâ t he call me a dog blazes he called me ten times a don-key and piled a lot of jack-ass-es on top of that He might as well have kicked me and done with it Maybe he did kick me and I did-nâ t ob-serve it I was so tak-en all aback with his brow some-how It flashed like a bleached bone What the devilâ s the mat-ter with me I donâ t stand right on my legs Com-ing afoul of that old man has a sort of turned me wrong side out By the Lord I must have been dream-ing thoughâ How how how â but the on-ly wayâ s to stash it so here goes to ham-mock again and in the morn-ing Iâ ll see how this plaguey jug-gling thinks over by day-light â CHAPTER 3 The Pipe When Stubb had depart-ed Ahab stood for a while lean-ing over the bul-warks and then as had been usu-al with him of late calling a sailor of the watch he sent him below for his ivory stool and al-so his pipe Light-ing the pipe at the bin-na-cle lamp and plant-ing the stool on the weather side of the deck he sat and smoked In old Norse times the thrones of the sea lov-ing Dan-ish kings were fabri-cat-ed saith tra-di-tion of the tusks of the nar-whale How could one look at Ahab then seat-ed on that tri-pod of bones without be-think-ing him of the roy-al-ty it sym-bol-ized For a Khan of the plank and a king of the sea and a great lord of Le-viathans was Ahab Some mo-men-ts passed dur-ing which the thick va-por came from his mouth in quick and con-stant puffs which blew back again in-to his face â How now â he so-lil-o-quized at last with-draw-ing the tube â this smok-ing no longer soothes Oh my pipe hard must it go with me if thy charm be gone Here have I been un-con-scious-ly toil-ing not plea-sur-ingâ aye and ig-no-rant-ly smok-ing to wind-ward all the while to wind-ward and with such ner-vous whiffs as if like the dy-ing whale my fi-nal jets were the strongest and fullest of trou-ble What busi-ness have I with this pipe This thing that is meant for serene-ness to send up mild white va-pors among mild white hairs not among torn iron grey locks like mine Iâ ll smoke no moreâ â He tossed the still light-ed pipe in-to the sea The fire hissed in the waves the same in-stant the ship shot by the bub-ble the sink-ing pipe made With slouched hat Ahab lurch-ing-ly paced the planks CHAPTER 31 Queen Mab Next morn-ing Stubb ac-cost-ed Flask â Such a queer dream King Post I nev-er had You know the old manâ s ivory leg well I dreamed he kicked me with it and when I tried to kick back upon my soul my lit-tle man I kicked my leg right off And then presto Ahab seemed a pyra-mid and I like a blaz-ing fool kept kick-ing at it But what was still more cu-ri-ous Flaskâ you know how cu-ri-ous all dreams areâ through all this rage that I was in I some-how seemed to be think-ing to my-self that after all it was not much of an in-sult that kick from Ahab â Why â thinks I â whatâ s the row Itâ s not a real leg on-ly a false leg â And thereâ s a mighty dif-fer-ence between a liv-ing thump and a dead thump Thatâ s what makes a blow from the hand Flask fifty times more sav-age to bear than a blow from a cane The liv-ing mem-berâ that makes the liv-ing in-sult my lit-tle man And thinks I to my-self all the while mind while I was stub-bing my sil-ly toes against that cursed pyra-midâ so con-found-ed-ly con-tra-dic-to-ry was it all all the while I say I was think-ing to my-self â whatâ s his leg now but a caneâ a whale-bone cane Yes â thinks I â it was on-ly a play-ful cudgellingâ in fact on-ly a whale-bon-ing that he gave meâ not a base kick Be-sides â thinks I â look at it once why the end of itâ the foot partâ what a small sort of end it is where-as if a broad foot-ed farmer kicked me thereâ s a devil-ish broad in-sult But this in-sult is whit-tled down to a point on-ly â But now comes the great-est joke of the dream Flask While I was bat-ter-ing away at the pyra-mid a sort of badger haired old mer-man with a hump on his back takes me by the shoul-ders and slews me round â What are you â bout â says he Slid man but I was fright-ened Such a phiz But some-how next mo-ment I was over the fright â What am I about â says I at last â And what busi-ness is that of yours I should like to know Mr Hump-back Do you want a kick â By the lord Flask I had no soon-er said that than he turned round his stern to me bent over and drag-ging up a lot of seaweed he had for a cloutâ what do you think I saw â why thun-der alive man his stern was stuck full of mar-lin-spikes with the poin-ts out Says I on se-cond thoughts â I guess I wonâ t kick you old fel-low â â Wise Stubb â said he â wise Stubb â and kept mut-ter-ing it all the time a sort of eat-ing of his own gums like a chim-ney hag See-ing he was-nâ t go-ing to stop say-ing over his â wise Stubb wise Stubb â I thought I might as well fall to kick-ing the pyra-mid again But I had on-ly just lift-ed my foot for it when he roared out â Stop that kick-ing â â Hal-loa â says I â whatâ s the mat-ter now old fel-low â â Look ye here â says he â letâ s ar-gue the in-sult Cap-tain Ahab kicked ye did-nâ t he â â Yes he did â says Iâ â right here it was â â Very good â says heâ â he used his ivory leg did-nâ t he â â Yes he did â says I â Well then â says he â wise Stubb what have you to com-plain of Did-nâ t he kick with right good will it was-nâ t a com-mon pitch pine leg he kicked with was it No you were kicked by a great man and with a beau-ti-ful ivory leg Stubb Itâ s an honor I con-sid-er it an honor Lis-ten wise Stubb In old Eng-land the great-est lords think it great glo-ry to be slapped by a queen and made garter knights of but be your boast Stubb that ye were kicked by old Ahab and made a wise man of Re-mem-ber what I say be kicked by him ac-count his kicks honors and on no ac-count kick back for you canâ t help your-self wise Stubb Donâ t you see that pyra-mid â With that he all of a sud-den seemed some-how in some queer fash-ion to swim off in-to the air I snored rolled over and there I was in my ham-mock Now what do you think of that dream Flask â â I donâ t know it seems a sort of fool-ish to me tho â â â May be may be But itâ s made a wise man of me Flask Dâ ye see Ahab stand-ing there side-ways look-ing over the stern Well the best thing you can do Flask is to let the old man alone nev-er speak to him what-ev-er he says Hal-loa Whatâ s that he shouts Hark â â Mast head there Look sharp all of ye There are whales here-abouts â If ye see a white one split your lungs for him â What do you think of that now Flask ainâ t there a small drop of some-thing queer about that eh A white whaleâ did ye mark that man Look yeâ thereâ s some-thing spe-cial in the wind Stand by for it Flask Ahab has that thatâ s bloody on his mind But mum he comes this way â CHAPTER 32 Ce-tol-o-gy Al-ready we are bold-ly launched upon the deep but soon we shall be lost in its un-shored har-bour-less im-men-si-ties Ere that come to pass ere the Pe-quodâ s weedy hull rol-ls side by side with the bar-na-cled hul-ls of the le-viathan at the out-set it is but well to at-tend to a mat-ter al-most indis-pens-able to a thor-ough ap-pre-cia-tive

would now fain put be-fore you Yet is it no easy task The clas-si-fi-ca-tion of the con-stituen-ts of a chaos noth-ing less is here es-sayed Lis-ten to what the best and lat-est author-i-ties have

who have at large or in lit-tle writ-ten of the whale Run over a few â The Authors of the Bi-ble Aris-to-tle Pliny Al-drovan-di Sir Thomas Browne Ges-ner Ray Lin-nÃ us Ron-deletius Wil-lough-by Green

fol-low-ing Owen ever saw liv-ing whales and but one of them was a real pro-fes-sion-al har-pooneer and whale-man I mean Cap-tain Scores-by On the separate sub-ject of the Green-land or right whale he is the best ex-ist-ing author-i-ty But Scores-by knew noth-ing and says noth-ing of the great sperm whale com-pared with which the Green-land whale is al-most un-wor-thy men-tion-ing And here be it said that the Green-land whale is an usurp-er upon the throne of the seas He is not even by any means the largest of the whales Yet owing to the long pri-or-i-ty of his claims and the pro-found ig-no-rance which till some seven-ty years back in-vest-ed the then fab-u-lous or ut-ter-ly un-known sperm whale and which ig-no-rance to this pre-sent day still reigns in all but some few sci-en-tif-ic re-treats and whale ports this usur-pa-tion has been every way com-plete Ref-er-ence to near-ly all the le-viathanic al-lu-sions in the great poets of past days will sat-is-fy you that the Green-land whale without one ri-val was to them the monarch of the seas But the time has at last come for a new procla-ma-tion This is Char-ing Cross hear ye good peo-ple all â the Green-land whale is de-posed â the great sperm whale now reigneth There are on-ly two books in be-ing which at all pre-tend to put the liv-ing sperm whale be-fore you and at the same time in the re-motest de-gree suc-ceed in the at-tempt Those books are Bealeâ s and Ben-net-tâ s both in their time sur-geons to English South Sea whale ships and both ex-act and reli-able men The orig-i-nal mat-ter touch-ing the sperm whale to be found in their vol-umes is ne-c-es-sar-i-ly small but so far as it goes it is of ex-cel-lent qual-i-ty though most-ly con-fined to sci-en-tif-ic de-scrip-tion As yet how-ev-er the sperm whale sci-en-tif-ic or poet-ic lives not com-plete in any lit-er-a-ture Far above all other hunt-ed whales his is an un-writ-ten life Now the var-i-ous species of whales need some sort of pop-u-lar com-pre-hen-sive clas-si-fi-ca-tion if on-ly an easy out-line one for the pre-sent hereafter to be filled in all its depart-men-ts by sub-se-quent la-bor-ers As no bet-ter man ad-vances to take this mat-ter in hand I here-upon of-fer my own poor en-deav-ors I promise noth-ing com-plete be-cause any hu-man thing sup-posed to be com-plete must for that very rea-son in-fal-li-bly be faulty I shall not pre-tend to a minute anatom-i-cal de-scrip-tion of the var-i-ous species orâ in this place at leastâ to much of any de-scrip-tion My ob-ject here is sim-ply to pro-ject the draught of a sys-tem-ati-za-tion of ce-tol-o-gy I am the ar-chi-tect not the builder But it is a pon-der-ous task no or-di-nary let-ter sorter in the Post Of-fice is equal to it To grope down in-to the bot-tom of the sea after them to have oneâ s hands among the un-speak-able foun-da-tions ribs and very pelvis of the world this is a fear-ful thing What am I that I should es-say to hook the nose of this le-viathan The aw-ful taunt-ings in Job might well ap-pal me Will he the le-viathan make a covenant with thee Be-hold the hope of him is vain But I have swam through li-braries and sailed through oceans I have had to do with whales with th-ese vis-i-ble hands I am in earnest and I will try There are some pre-lim-i-nar-ies to set-tle First The uncer-tain unset-tled con-di-tion of this science of Ce-tol-o-gy is in the very vestibule attest-ed by the fact that in some quar-ters it still re-mains a moot point whether a whale be a fish In his Sys-tem of Na-ture A D 1776 Lin-nÃ us de-clares â I here-by separate the whales from the fish â But of my own knowl-edge I know that down to the year 185 sharks and shad alewives and her-ring against Lin-nÃ usâ s ex-press edict were still found di-vid-ing the posses-sion of the same seas with the Le-viathan The grounds upon which Lin-nÃ us would fain have ban-ished the whales from the waters he states as fol-lows â On ac-count of their warm biloc-u-lar heart their lungs their mov-able eyelids their hol-low ears pen-em in-tran-tem fem-i-nam mam-mis lac-tan-tem â and fi-nal-ly â ex lege naturÃ jure mer-i-toque â I sub-mit-ted all this to my friends Sime-on Macey and Charley Cof-fin of Nan-tuck-et both mess-mates of mine in a cer-tain voy-age and they unit-ed in the opin-ion that the rea-sons set forth were al-to-geth-er in-suf-fi-cient Charley pro-fane-ly hint-ed they were hum-bug Be it known that waiv-ing all ar-gu-ment I take the good old fash-ioned ground that the whale is a fish and call upon holy Jon-ah to back me This fun-da-men-tal thing set-tled the next point is in what in-ter-nal re-spect does the whale dif-fer from other fish Above Lin-nÃ us has giv-en you those items But in brief they are th-ese lungs and warm blood where-as all other fish are lun-g-less and cold blood-ed Next how shall we de-fine the whale by his ob-vi-ous ex-ter-nals so as con-spic-u-ous-ly to la-bel him for all time to come To be short then a whale is a spout-ing fish with a hor-i-zon-tal tail There you have him How-ev-er con-tract-ed that def-i-ni-tion is the re-sult of ex-pand-ed med-i-ta-tion A wal-rus spouts much like a whale but the wal-rus is not a fish be-cause he is am-phibi-ous But the last term of the def-i-ni-tion is still more co-gent as cou-pled with the first Al-most any one must have no-ticed that all the fish fa-mil-iar to lands-men have not a flat but a ver-ti-cal or up and down tail Where-as among spout-ing fish the tail though it may be sim-i-lar-ly shaped in-vari-ably as-sumes a hor-i-zon-tal po-si-tion By the above def-i-ni-tion of what a whale is I do by no means ex-clude from the le-viathanic brother-hood any sea crea-ture hither-to iden-ti-fied with the whale by the best in-formed Nan-tuck-eters nor on the other hand link with it any fish hither-to author-i-ta-tive-ly re-gard-ed as alien Hence all the smaller spout-ing and hor-i-zon-tal tailed fish must be in-clud-ed in this ground plan of Ce-tol-o-gy Now then come the grand divi-sions of the en-tire whale host I am aware that down to the pre-sent time the fish styled La-matins and Du-gongs Pig fish and Sow fish of the Coffins of Nan-tuck-et are in-clud-ed by many nat-u-ral-ists among the whales But as th-ese pig fish are a noisy con-temptible set most-ly lurk-ing in the mouths of rivers and feed-ing on wet hay and espe-cial-ly as they do not spout I de-ny their cre-den-tials as whales and have pre-sent-ed them with their pass-ports to quit the King-dom of Ce-tol-o-gy First Ac-cord-ing to mag-ni-tude I di-vide the whales in-to three pri-ma-ry BOOKS sub-di-vis-i-ble in-to CHAPTERS and th-ese shall com-pre-hend them all both small and large I THE FOLIO WHALE II the OCTAVO WHALE III the

of old vague-ly known as the Trumpa whale and the Phy-seter whale and the Anvil Head-ed whale is the pre-sent Cachalot of the French and the Potts-fich of the Ger-mans and the Macro-cephalus of the Long Words He is without doubt the largest in-hab-i-tant of the globe the most formidable of all whales to en-counter the most ma-jes-tic in aspect and last-ly by far the most valu-able in com-merce he be-ing the on-ly crea-ture from which that valu-able sub-stance sper-ma-ceti is ob-tained All his pe-cu-liar-i-ties will in many other places be en-larged upon It is chiefly with his name that I now have to do Philo-log-i-cal-ly con-sid-ered it is ab-surd Some cen-turies ago when the Sperm whale was al-most whol-ly un-known in his own prop-er in-di-vid-u-al-i-ty and when his oil was on-ly ac-ci-den-tal-ly ob-tained from the strand-ed fish in those days sper-ma-ceti it would seem was pop-u-lar-ly sup-posed to be derived from a crea-ture iden-ti-cal with the one then known in Eng-land as the Green-land or Right Whale It was the idea al-so that this same sper-ma-ceti was that quick-en-ing hu-mor of the Green-land Whale which the first syl-la-ble of the word lit-er-al-ly ex-press-es In those times al-so sper-ma-ceti was ex-ceed-ing-ly scarce not be-ing used for light but on-ly as an oint-ment and medica-ment It was on-ly to be had from the drug-gists as you nowa-days buy an ounce of rhubarb When as I opine in the course of time the true na-ture of sper-ma-ceti be-came known its orig-i-nal name was still re-tained by the deal-ers no doubt to en-hance its value by a no-tion so strange-ly sig-nif-i-cant of its scarci-ty And so the ap-pel-la-tion must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this sper-ma-ceti was real-ly derived BOOK I Fo-lio CHAPTER II Right Whale â In one re-spect this is the most ven-er-a-ble of the le-viathans be-ing the one first reg-u-lar-ly hunt-ed by man It yields the ar-ti-cle com-mon-ly known as whale-bone or baleen and the oil spe-cial-ly known as â whale oil â an in-fe-ri-or ar-ti-cle in com-merce Among the fish-er-men he is indis-crim-i-nate-ly des-ig-nat-ed by all the fol-low-ing ti-tles The Whale the Green-land Whale the Black Whale the Great Whale the True Whale the Right Whale There is a deal of ob-scu-ri-ty con-cern-ing the iden-ti-ty of the species thus mul-ti-tudi-nous-ly bap-tised What then is the whale which I in-clude in the se-cond species of my Fo-lios It is the Great Mys-tice-tus of the English nat-u-ral-ists the Green-land Whale of the English whale-men the Baleine Or-di-naire of the French whale-men the Grow-lands Wal-fish of the Swedes It is the whale which for more than two cen-turies past has been hunt-ed by the Dutch and English in the Arc-tic seas it is the whale which the Amer-i-can fish-er-men have long pur-sued in the In-di-an ocean on the Brazil Banks on the Norâ West Coast and var-i-ous other parts of the world des-ig-nat-ed by them Right Whale Cruis-ing Grounds Some pre-tend to see a dif-fer-ence between the Green-land whale of the English and the right whale of the Amer-i-cans But they pre-cise-ly agree in all their grand fea-tures nor has there yet been pre-sent-ed a sin-gle deter-mi-nate fact upon which to ground a rad-i-cal distinc-tion It is by end-less sub-di-vi-sions based upon the most in-con-clu-sive dif-fer-ences that some depart-men-ts of nat-u-ral his-to-ry be-come so re-pelling-ly in-tri-cate The right whale will be else-where treat-ed of at some length with ref-er-ence to elu-ci-dat-ing the sperm whale BOOK I Fo-lio CHAPTER III Fin Back â Un-der this head I reck-on a mon-ster which by the var-i-ous names of Fin Back Tall Spout and Long John has been seen al-most in every sea and is com-mon-ly the whale whose dis-tant jet is so often de-scried by pas-sen-gers cross-ing the At-lantic in the New York pack-et tracks In the length he at-tains and in his baleen the Fin back re-sem-bles the right whale but is of a less port-ly girth and a lighter colour ap-proach-ing to olive His great lips pre-sent a cable like aspect formed by the in-ter-twist-ing slant-ing folds of large wrin-kles His grand distin-guish-ing fea-ture the fin from which he derives his name is often a con-spic-u-ous ob-ject This fin is some three or four feet long grow-ing ver-ti-cal-ly from the hin-der part of the back of an an-gu-lar shape and with a very sharp point-ed end Even if not the slight-est other part of the crea-ture be vis-i-ble this iso-lat-ed fin will at times be seen plain-ly pro-ject-ing from the sur-face When the sea is moder-ate-ly calm and slight-ly marked with spher-i-cal rip-ples and this gnomon like fin stands up and casts shad-ows upon the wrin-kled sur-face it may well be sup-posed that the watery cir-cle sur-round-ing it some-what re-sem-bles a dial with its style and wavy hour lines graved on it On that Ahaz dial the shad-ow often goes back The Fin Back is not gre-gar-i-ous He seems a whale hater as some men are man haters Very shy al-ways go-ing soli-tary un-ex-pect-ed-ly ris-ing to the sur-face in the re-motest and most sullen waters his straight and sin-gle lofty jet ris-ing like a tall misan-throp-ic spear upon a bar-ren plain gift-ed with such won-drous pow-er and ve-loc-i-ty in swim-ming as to de-fy all pre-sent pur-suit from man this le-viathan seems the ban-ished and un-con-quer-able Cain of his race bear-ing for his mark that style upon his back From hav-ing the baleen in his mouth the Fin Back is some-times in-clud-ed with the right whale among a the-o-ret-ic species denom-i-nat-ed Whale-bone whales that is whales with baleen Of th-ese so called Whale-bone whales there would seem to be sev-er-al va-ri-eties most of which how-ev-er are lit-tle known Broad nosed whales and beaked whales pike head-ed whales bunched whales un-der jawed whales and ros-trat-ed whales are the fish-er-menâ s names for a few sorts In con-nec-tion with this ap-pella-tive of â Whale-bone whales â it is of great im-por-tance to men-tion that how-ev-er such a nomen-cla-ture may be con-ve-nient in fa-cil-i-tat-ing al-lu-sions to some kind of whales yet it is in vain to at-tempt a clear clas-si-fi-ca-tion of the Le-viathan found-ed upon either his baleen or hump or fin or teeth notwith-stand-ing that those marked parts or fea-tures very ob-vi-ous-ly seem bet-ter adapt-ed to af-ford the ba-sis for a reg-u-lar sys-tem of Ce-tol-o-gy than any other de-tached bodi-ly distinc-tions which the whale in his kinds pre-sen-ts How then The baleen hump back fin and teeth th-ese are things whose pe-cu-liar-i-ties are indis-crim-i-nate-ly dis-persed among all sorts of whales without any re-gard to what may be the na-ture of their struc-ture in other and more essen-tial par-tic-u-lars Thus the sperm whale and the hump-backed whale each has a hump but there the simil-i-tude ceas-es Then this same hump-backed whale and the Green-land whale each of th-ese has baleen but there again the simil-i-tude ceas-es And it is just the same with the other parts above men-tioned In var-i-ous sorts of whales they form such ir-reg-u-lar com-bi-na-tions or in the case of any one of them de-tached such an ir-reg-u-lar iso-la-tion as ut-ter-ly to de-fy all gen-er-al meth-od-iza-tion formed upon such a ba-sis On this rock every one of the whale nat-u-ral-ists has split But it may pos-si-bly be con-ceived that in the in-ter-nal parts of the whale in his anato-myâ there at least we shall be able to hit the right clas-si-fi-ca-tion Nay what thing for ex-am-ple is there in the Green-land whaleâ s anato-my more strik-ing than his baleen Yet we have seen that by his baleen it is im-pos-si-ble cor-rect-ly to clas-si-fy the Green-land whale And if you descend in-to the bow-els of the var-i-ous le-viathans why there you will not find distinc-tions a fifti-eth part as avail-able to the sys-tem-atiz-er as those ex-ter-nal ones al-ready enu-mer-at-ed What then re-mains noth-ing but to take hold of the whales bodi-ly in their en-tire lib-er-al vol-ume and bold-ly sort them that way And this is the Bi-b-li-o-graph-i-cal sys-tem here adopt-ed and it is the on-ly one that can pos-si-bly suc-ceed for it alone is prac-ti-ca-ble To pro-ceed BOOK I Fo-lio CHAPTER IV Hump Back â This whale is often seen on the north-ern Amer-i-can coast He has been fre-quent-ly cap-tured there and towed in-to har-bor He has a great pack on him like a ped-dler or you might call him the Ele-phant and Cas-tle whale At any rate the pop-u-lar name for him does not suf-fi-cient-ly distin-guish him since the sperm whale al-so has a hump though a smaller one His oil is not very valu-able He has baleen He is the most game-some and light heart-ed of all the whales mak-ing more gay foam and white water gen-er-al-ly than any other of them BOOK I Fo-lio CHAPTER V Ra-zor Back â Of this whale lit-tle is known but his name I have seen him at a dis-tance off Cape Horn Of a re-tir-ing na-ture he eludes both hun-ters and philoso-phers Though no coward he has nev-er yet shown any part of him but his back which ris-es in a long sharp ridge Let him go I know lit-tle more of him nor does any-body else BOOK I Fo-lio CHAPTER VI Sul-phur Bot-tom â Another re-tir-ing gentle-man with a brim-stone bel-ly doubt-less got by scrap-ing along the Tar-tar-i-an tiles in some of his pro-founder div-ings He is sel-dom seen at least I have nev-er seen him ex-cept in the re-mot-er south-ern seas and then al-ways at too great a dis-tance to study his coun-te-nance He is nev-er chased he would run away with rope walks of line Prodi-gies are told of him Adieu Sul-phur Bot-tom I can say noth-ing more that is true of ye nor can the oldest Nan-tuck-eter Thus ends BOOK I Fo-lio and now be-gins BOOK II Oc-ta-vo OCTAVOES â Th-ese em-brace the whales of mid-dling mag-ni-tude among which pre-sent may be num-bered â I the Gram-pus II the Black Fish III the Nar-whale IV the Thrash-er V the Killer Why this book of whales is not denom-i-nat-ed the Quar-to is very plain Be-cause while the whales of this order though smaller than those of the former order nev-er-the-less re-tain a pro-por-tion-ate like-ness to them in fig-ure yet the book-binderâ s Quar-to vol-ume in its di-men-sioned form does not pre-serve the shape of the Fo-lio vol-ume but the Oc-ta-vo vol-ume does BOOK II Oc-ta-vo CHAPTER I Gram-pus â Though this fish whose loud sonorous breath-ing or rather blow-ing has fur-nished a proverb to lands-men is so well known a denizen of the deep yet is he not pop-u-lar-ly classed among whales But possess-ing all the grand distinc-tive fea-tures of the le-viathan most nat-u-ral-ists have recog-nised him for one He is of moder-ate oc-ta-vo size vary-ing from fif-teen to twen-ty five feet in length and of cor-re-spond-ing di-men-sions round the waist He swims in herds he is nev-er reg-u-lar-ly hunt-ed though his oil is con-sid-er-able in quan-ti-ty and pret-ty good for light By some fish-er-men his ap-proach is re-gard-ed as pre-mon-i-to-ry of the ad-vance of the great sperm whale BOOK II Oc-ta-vo CHAPTER II Black Fish â I give the pop-u-lar fish-er-menâ s names for all th-ese fish for gen-er-al-ly they are the best Where any name hap-pens to be vague or in-ex-pres-sive I shall say so and suggest another I do so now touch-ing the Black Fish so called be-cause black-ness is the rule among al-most all whales So call him the Hye-na Whale if you please His vo-rac-i-ty is well known and from the cir-cum-stance that the in-ner an-gles of his lips are curved up-wards he car-ries an ever-last-ing Mephistophe-lean grin on his face This whale aver-ages some six-teen or eigh-teen feet in length He is found in al-most all lat-i-tudes He has a pe-cu-liar way of show-ing his dor-sal hooked fin in swim-ming which looks some-thing like a Ro-man nose When not more profitably em-ployed the sperm whale hun-ters some-times cap-ture the Hye-na whale to keep up the sup-ply of cheap oil for do-mes-tic em-ploy-men-tâ as some fru-gal house-keep-ers in the ab-sence of com-pa-ny and quite alone by them-selves burn un-sa-vory tal-low in-stead of odorous wax Though their blub-ber is very thin some of th-ese whales will yield you up-wards of thir-ty gal-lons of oil BOOK II Oc-ta-vo CHAPTER III Nar-whale that is Nostril whale â Another in-stance of a cu-ri-ous-ly named whale so named I sup-pose from his pe-cu-liar horn be-ing orig-i-nal-ly mis-tak-en for a peaked nose The crea-ture is some six-teen feet in length while its horn aver-ages five feet though some ex-ceed ten and even at-tain to fif-teen feet Strict-ly speak-ing this horn is but a length-ened tusk grow-ing out from the jaw in a line a lit-tle de-pressed from the hor-i-zon-tal But it is on-ly found on the sin-is-ter side which has an ill ef-fect giv-ing its own-er some-thing anal-o-gous to the aspect of a clum-sy left hand-ed man What pre-cise pur-pose this ivory horn or lance an-swers it would be hard to say It does not seem to be used like the blade of the sword fish and bill fish though some sailors tell me that the Nar-whale em-ploys it for a rake in turn-ing over the bot-tom of the sea for food Charley Cof-fin said it was used for an ice piercer for the Nar-whale ris-ing to the sur-face of the Po-lar Sea and find-ing it sheet-ed with ice thrusts his horn up and so breaks through But you can-not prove either of th-ese sur-mis-es to be cor-rect My own opin-ion is that how-ev-er this one sid-ed horn may real-ly be used by the Nar-whaleâ how-ev-er that may beâ it would cer-tain-ly be very con-ve-nient to him for a fold-er in read-ing pam-phlets The Nar-whale I have heard called the Tusked whale the Horned whale and the Uni-corn whale He is cer-tain-ly a cu-ri-ous ex-am-ple of the Uni-cor-nism to be found in al-most every king-dom of an-i-mat-ed na-ture From cer-tain clois-tered old authors I have gathered that this same sea uni-cornâ s horn was in an-cient days re-gard-ed as the great an-ti-dote against poi-son and as such prepa-ra-tions of it brought im-mense prices It was al-so dis-tilled to a vo-latile salts for faint-ing ladies the same way that the horns of the male deer are man-u-fac-tured in-to hartshorn Orig-i-nal-ly it was in it-self ac-count-ed an ob-ject of great cu-rios-i-ty Black Let-ter tel-ls me that Sir Martin Fro-bish-er on his re-turn from that voy-age when Queen Bess did gal-lant-ly wave her jewelled hand to him from a win-dow of Green-wich Palace as his bold ship sailed down the Thames â when Sir Martin re-turned from that voy-age â saith Black Let-ter â on bend-ed knees he pre-sent-ed to her high-ness a prodi-gious long horn of the Nar-whale which for a long pe-ri-od after hung in the cas-tle at Wind-sor â An Ir-ish author avers that the Earl of Le-ices-ter on bend-ed knees did like-wise pre-sent to her high-ness another horn per-tain-ing to a land beast of the uni-corn na-ture The Nar-whale has a very pic-turesque leop-ard like look be-ing of a milk white ground colour dot-ted with round and ob-long spots of black His oil is very su-pe-ri-or clear and fine but there is lit-tle of it and he is sel-dom hunt-ed He is most-ly found in the cir-cum-po-lar seas BOOK II Oc-ta-vo CHAPTER IV Killer â Of this whale lit-tle is pre-cise-ly known to the Nan-tuck-eter and noth-ing at all to the pro-fessed nat-u-ral-ist From what I have seen of him at a dis-tance I should say that he was about the big-ness of a gram-pus He is very sav-ageâ a sort of Feegee fish He some-times takes the great Fo-lio whales by the lip and hangs there like a leech till the mighty brute is wor-ried to death The Killer is nev-er hunt-ed I nev-er heard what sort of oil he has Ex-cep-tion might be tak-en to the name bestowed upon this whale on the ground of its indis-tinct-ness For we are all killers on land and on sea Bon-a-partes and Sharks in-clud-ed BOOK II Oc-ta-vo CHAPTER V Thrash-er â This gentle-man is fa-mous for his tail which he us-es for a ferule in thrash-ing his foes He moun-ts the Fo-lio whaleâ s back and as he swims he works his pas-sage by flog-ging him as some school-mas-ters get along in the world by a sim-i-lar pro-cess Still less is known of the Thrash-er than of the Killer Both are out-laws even in the law-less seas Thus ends BOOK II Oc-ta-vo and be-gins BOOK III Duodec-i-mo DUODECIMOES â Th-ese in-clude the smaller whales I The Huz-za Por-poise II The Al-ger-ine Por-poise III The Mealy mouthed Por-poise To those who have not chanced spe-cial-ly to study the sub-ject it may pos-si-bly seem strange that fish-es not com-mon-ly ex-ceed-ing four or five feet should be mar-shalled among WHALESâ a word which in the pop-u-lar sense al-ways con-veys an idea of hu-ge-ness But the crea-tures set down above as Duodec-i-moes are in-fal-li-bly whales by the ter-ms of my def-i-ni-tion of what a whale isâ i e a spout-ing fish with a hor-i-zon-tal tail BOOK III Duodec-i-mo CHAPTER 1 Huz-za Por-poise â This is the com-mon por-poise found al-most all over the globe The name is of my own bestow-al for there are more than one sort of por-pois-es and some-thing must be done to distin-guish them I call him thus be-cause he al-ways swims in hi-lar-i-ous shoals which upon the broad sea keep toss-ing them-selves to heav-en like caps in a Fourth of Ju-ly crowd Their ap-pear-ance is gen-er-al-ly hailed with de-light by the mariner Full of fine spir-its they in-vari-ably come from the breezy bil-lows to wind-ward They are the lads that al-ways live be-fore the wind They are ac-count-ed a lucky omen If you your-self can with-stand three cheers at be-hold-ing th-ese vi-va-cious fish then heav-en help ye the spir-it of god-ly game-some-ness is not in ye A well fed plump Huz-za Por-poise will yield you one good gal-lon of good oil But the fine and del-i-cate flu-id ex-tract-ed from his jaws is ex-ceed-ing-ly valu-able It is in re-quest among jewellers and watch-mak-ers Sailors put it on their hones Por-poise meat is good eat-ing you know It may nev-er have oc-curred to you that a por-poise spouts In-deed his spout is so small that it is not very read-i-ly dis-cernible But the next time you have a chance watch him and you will then see the great Sperm whale him-self in minia-ture BOOK III Duodec-i-mo CHAPTER II Al-ger-ine Por-poise â A pi-rate Very sav-age He is on-ly found I think in the Pa-cif-ic He is some-what larg-er than the Huz-za Por-poise but much of the same gen-er-al make Pro-voke him and he will buck-le to a shark I have low-ered for him many times but nev-er yet saw him cap-tured BOOK III Duodec-i-mo CHAPTER III Mealy mouthed Por-poise â The largest kind of Por-poise and on-ly found in the Pa-cif-ic so far as it is known The on-ly English name by which he has hither-to been des-ig-nat-ed is that of the fish-er-sâ Right Whale Por-poise from the cir-cum-stance that he is chiefly found in the vicin-i-ty of that Fo-lio In shape he dif-fers in some de-gree from the Huz-za Por-poise be-ing of a less ro-tund and jol-ly girth in-deed he is of quite a neat and gentle-man like fig-ure He has no fins on his back most other por-pois-es have he has a love-ly tail and sen-ti-men-tal In-di-an eyes of a hazel hue But his mealy mouth spoils all Though his en-tire back down to his side fins is of a deep sable yet a boundary line distinct as the mark in a shipâ s hull called the â bright waist â that line streaks him from stem to stern with two separate colours black above and white below The white com-pris-es part of his head and the whole of his mouth which makes him look as if he had just es-caped from a felo-nious visit to a meal bag A most mean and mealy aspect His oil is much like that of the com-mon por-poise Beyond the DUODECIMO this sys-tem does not pro-ceed inas-much as the Por-poise is the smallest of the whales Above you have all the Le-viathans of note But there are a rab-ble of uncer-tain fugi-tive half fab-u-lous whales which as an Amer-i-can whale-man I know by rep-u-ta-tion but not per-son-al-ly I shall enu-mer-ate them by their fore cas-tle ap-pel-la-tions for pos-si-bly such a list may be valu-able to fu-ture in-ves-ti-ga-tors who may com-plete what I have here but be-gun If any of the fol-low-ing whales shall hereafter be caught and marked then he can read-i-ly be in-cor-po-rat-ed in-to this Sys-tem ac-cord-ing to his Fo-lio Oc-ta-vo or Duodec-i-mo mag-ni-tude â The Bot-tle Nose Whale the Junk Whale the Pud-ding Head-ed Whale the Cape Whale the Lead-ing Whale the Can-non Whale the Scragg Whale the Cop-pered Whale the Ele-phant Whale the Ice-berg Whale the Quog Whale the Blue Whale etc From Ice-landic Dutch and old English author-i-ties there might be quot-ed other lists of uncer-tain whales blessed with all man-ner of un-couth names But I omit them as al-to-geth-er ob-so-lete and can hard-ly help sus-pect-ing them for mere sounds full of Le-viathanism but sig-ni-fy-ing noth-ing Fi-nal-ly It was stat-ed at the out-set that this sys-tem would not be here and at once per-fect-ed You can-not but plain-ly see that I have kept my word But I now leave my ce-to-log-i-cal Sys-tem stand-ing thus un-fin-ished even as the great Cathe-dral of Cologne was left with the crane still stand-ing upon the top of the un-com-plet-ed tow-er For small erec-tions may be fin-ished by their first ar-chi-tec-ts grand ones true ones ever leave the cope-stone to pos-ter-i-ty God keep me from ever com-plet-ing any-thing This whole book is but a draugh-tâ nay but the draught of a draught Oh Time Strength Cash and Pa-tience CHAPTER 33 The Speck-sny-der Con-cern-ing the of-fi-cers of the whale craft this seems as good a place as any to set down a lit-tle do-mes-tic pe-cu-liar-i-ty on ship board aris-ing from the ex-is-tence of the har-pooneer class of of-fi-cers a class un-known of course in any other marine than the whale fleet The large im-por-tance at-tached to the har-pooneerâ s vo-ca-tion is evinced by the fact that orig-i-nal-ly in the old Dutch Fish-ery two cen-turies and more ago the com-mand of a whale ship was not whol-ly lodged in the per-son now called the cap-tain but was di-vid-ed between him and an of-fi-cer called the Speck-sny-der Lit-er-al-ly this word means Fat Cut-ter usage how-ev-er in time made it equiv-a-lent to Chief Har-pooneer In those days the cap-tainâ s author-i-ty was restrict-ed to the nav-i-ga-tion and gen-er-al man-age-ment of the ves-sel while over the whale hunt-ing depart-ment and all its con-cerns the Speck-sny-der or Chief Har-pooneer reigned supreme In the Bri-tish Green-land Fish-ery un-der the cor-rupt-ed ti-tle of Speck-sioneer this old Dutch of-fi-cial is still re-tained but his former dig-ni-ty is sad-ly abridged At pre-sent he ranks sim-ply as se-nior Har-pooneer and as such is but one of the cap-tainâ s more in-fe-ri-or subal-terns Nev-er-the-less as upon the good con-duct of the har-pooneers the suc-cess of a whal-ing voy-age large-ly depends and since in the Amer-i-can Fish-ery he is not on-ly an im-por-tant of-fi-cer in the boat but un-der cer-tain cir-cum-stances night watch-es on a whal-ing ground the com-mand of the shipâ s deck is al-so his there-fore the grand po-lit-i-cal max-im of the sea de-mands that he should nom-i-nal-ly live apart from the men be-fore the mast and be in some way distin-guished as their pro-fes-sion-al su-pe-ri-or though al-ways by them fa-mil-iar-ly re-gard-ed as their so-cial equal Now the grand distinc-tion drawn between of-fi-cer and man at sea is thisâ the first lives aft the last for-ward Hence in whale ships and mer-chant-men alike the mates have their quar-ters with the cap-tain and so too in most of the Amer-i-can whalers the har-pooneers are lodged in the after part of the ship That is to say they take their meals in the cap-tainâ s cabin and sleep in a place indi-rect-ly com-mu-ni-cat-ing with it Though the long pe-ri-od of a South-ern whal-ing voy-age by far the longest of all voy-ages now or ever made by man the pe-cu-liar per-ils of it and the com-mu-ni-ty of in-ter-est pre-vail-ing among a com-pa-ny all of whom high or low depend for their profits not upon fixed wages but upon their com-mon luck to-geth-er with their com-mon vig-i-lance in-tre-pid-i-ty and hard work though all th-ese things do in some cas-es tend to beget a less rig-or-ous dis-ci-pline than in mer-chant-men gen-er-al-ly yet nev-er mind how much like an old Me-sopotami-an fam-i-ly th-ese whale-men may in some prim-i-tive in-stances live to-geth-er for all that the punc-til-ious ex-ter-nals at least of the quar-ter deck are sel-dom ma-te-ri-al-ly re-laxed and in no in-stance done away In-deed many are the Nan-tuck-et ships in which you will see the skip-per parad-ing his quar-ter deck with an elat-ed gran-deur not sur-passed in any mil-i-tary navy nay ex-tort-ing al-most as much out-ward ho-mage as if he wore the im-pe-ri-al pur-ple and not the shab-bi-est of pilot cloth And though of all men the moody cap-tain of the Pe-quod was the least giv-en to that sort of shal-low-est as-sump-tion and though the on-ly ho-mage he ever ex-act-ed was im-plic-it in-stan-ta-neous obe-di-ence though he re-quired no man to re-move the shoes from his feet ere step-ping upon the quar-ter deck and though there were times when owing to pe-cu-liar cir-cum-stances con-nect-ed with even-ts hereafter to be de-tailed he ad-dressed them in unusu-al ter-ms whether of con-de-scen-sion or in ter-rorem or other-wise yet even Cap-tain Ahab was by no means unob-ser-vant of the paramount for-ms and usages of the sea Nor per-haps will it fail to be even-tu-al-ly per-ceived that be-hind those for-ms and usages as it were he some-times masked him-self in-ci-den-tal-ly mak-ing use of them for other and more pri-vate ends than they were le-git-i-mate-ly in-tend-ed to sub-serve That cer-tain sul-tanism of his brain which had other-wise in a good de-gree re-mained un-man-i-fest-ed through those for-ms that same sul-tanism be-came in-car-nate in an ir-re-sistible dic-ta-tor-ship For be a manâ s in-tel-lec-tu-al su-pe-ri-or-i-ty what it will it can nev-er as-sume the prac-ti-cal avail-able suprema-cy over other men without the aid of some sort of ex-ter-nal arts and en-trench-men-ts al-ways in them-selves more or less pal-try and base This it is that for ever keeps Godâ s true princes of the Em-pire from the worldâ s hust-ings and leaves the high-est honors that this air can give to those men who be-come fa-mous more through their in-fi-nite in-fe-ri-or-i-ty to the choice hid-den hand-ful of the Divine In-ert than through their un-doubt-ed su-pe-ri-or-i-ty over the dead lev-el of the mass Such large virtue lurks in th-ese small things when ex-treme po-lit-i-cal su-per-sti-tions in-vest them that in some roy-al in-stances even to idiot im-be-cil-i-ty they have im-part-ed po-ten-cy But when as in the case of Ni-cholas the Czar the ringed crown of geo-graph-i-cal em-pire en-cir-cles an im-pe-ri-al brain then the ple-beian herds crouch abased be-fore the tre-men-dous cen-tral-iza-tion Nor will the trag-ic drama-tist who would depict mor-tal in-domitable-ness in its fullest sweep and direct swing ever for-get a hint in-ci-den-tal-ly so im-por-tant in his art as the one now al-lud-ed to But Ahab my Cap-tain still moves be-fore me in all his Nan-tuck-et grim-ness and shag-gi-ness and in this episode touch-ing Em-per-ors and Kings I must not con-ceal that I have on-ly to do with a poor old whale hunter like him and there-fore all out-ward ma-jes-ti-cal trap-pings and hous-ings are de-nied me Oh Ahab what shall be grand in thee it must needs be plucked at from the skies and dived for in the deep and fea-tured in the un-bod-ied air CHAPTER 34 The Cabin Table It is noon and Dough Boy the ste-ward thrust-ing his pale loaf of bread face from the cabin scut-tle an-nounces din-ner to his lord and master who sit-ting in the lee quar-ter boat has just been tak-ing an ob-ser-va-tion of the sun and is now mute-ly reck-on-ing the lat-i-tude on the smooth medal-lion shaped tablet re-served for that dai-ly pur-pose on the up-per part of his ivory leg From his com-plete inat-ten-tion to the tid-ings you would think that moody Ahab had not heard his me-nial But present-ly catch-ing hold of the mizen shrouds he swings him-self to the deck and in an even unex-hil-a-rat-ed voice say-ing â Din-ner Mr Star-buck â dis-ap-pears in-to the cabin When the last echo of his sul-tanâ s step has died away and Star-buck the first Emir has every rea-son to sup-pose that he is seat-ed then Star-buck rous-es from his qui-etude takes a few turns along the planks and after a grave peep in-to the bin-na-cle says with some touch of pleas-ant-ness â Din-ner Mr Stubb â and descends the scut-tle The se-cond Emir lounges about the rig-ging awhile and then slight-ly shak-ing the main brace to see whether it will be all right with that im-por-tant rope he like-wise takes up the old bur-den and with a rapid â Din-ner Mr Flask â fol-lows after his pre-de-ces-sors But the third Emir now see-ing him-self all alone on the quar-ter deck seems to feel relieved from some cu-ri-ous res-traint for tip-ping all sorts of know-ing winks in all sorts of direc-tions and kick-ing off his shoes he strikes in-to a sharp but noise-less squall of a horn-pipe right over the Grand Turkâ s head and then by a dex-ter-ous sleight pitch-ing his cap up in-to the mizen-top for a shelf he goes down rol-lick-ing so far at least as he re-mains vis-i-ble from the deck rev-ers-ing all other pro-ces-sions by bring-ing up the rear with mu-sic But ere step-ping in-to the cabin door-way below he paus-es ships a new face al-to-geth-er and then in-de-pen-dent hi-lar-i-ous lit-tle Flask en-ters King Ahabâ s pres-ence in the char-ac-ter of Ab-jec-tus or the Slave It is not the least among the strange things bred by the in-tense ar-ti-fi-cial-ness of sea usages that while in the open air of the deck some of-fi-cers will upon provo-ca-tion bear them-selves bold-ly and de-fy-ing-ly enough towards their com-man-der yet ten to one let those very of-fi-cers the next mo-ment go down to their cus-tom-ary din-ner in that same com-man-derâ s cabin and straight-way their inof-fen-sive not to say dep-re-ca-to-ry and hum-ble air towards him as he sits at the head of the table this is marvel-lous some-times most com-i-cal Where-fore this dif-fer-ence A prob-lem Per-haps not To have been Bels-haz-zar King of Baby-lon and to have been Bels-haz-zar not haugh-ti-ly but cour-te-ous-ly there-in cer-tain-ly must have been some touch of mun-dane gran-deur But he who in the right-ly re-gal and in-tel-li-gent spir-it pre-sides over his own pri-vate din-ner table of in-vit-ed guests that manâ s un-chal-lenged pow-er and do-min-ion of in-di-vid-u-al in-flu-ence for the time that manâ s roy-al-ty of state tran-scends Bels-haz-zarâ s for Bels-haz-zar was not the great-est Who has but once dined his friends has tast-ed what it is to be CÃ sar It is a witch-ery of so-cial czar-ship which there is no with-stand-ing Now if to this con-sid-er-a-tion you su-per-add the of-fi-cial suprema-cy of a ship master then by in-fer-ence you will derive the cause of that pe-cu-liar-i-ty of sea life just men-tioned Over his ivory in-laid table Ahab presid-ed like a mute maned sea lion on the white co-ral beach sur-round-ed by his war-like but still def-er-en-tial cubs In his own prop-er turn each of-fi-cer wait-ed to be served They were as lit-tle chil-dren be-fore Ahab and yet in Ahab there seemed not to lurk the smallest so-cial ar-ro-gance With one mind their in-tent eyes all fas-tened upon the old manâ s knife as he carved the chief dish be-fore him I do not sup-pose that for the world they would have pro-faned that mo-ment with the slight-est ob-ser-va-tion even upon so neu-tral a topic as the weather No And when reach-ing out his knife and fork between which the slice of beef was locked Ahab there-by mo-tioned Star-buckâ s plate towards him the mate re-ceived his meat as though re-ceiv-ing alms and cut it ten-der-ly and a lit-tle start-ed if per-chance the knife grazed against the plate and chewed it noise-less-ly and swal-lowed it not without cir-cum-spec-tion For like the Corona-tion ban-quet at Frank-fort where the Ger-man Em-per-or pro-found-ly dines with the seven Im-pe-ri-al Elec-tors so th-ese cabin meals were some-how solemn meals eat-en in aw-ful si-lence and yet at table old Ahab for-bade not con-ver-sa-tion on-ly he him-self was dumb What a relief it was to chok-ing Stubb when a rat made a sud-den rack-et in the hold below And poor lit-tle Flask he was the youngest son and lit-tle boy of this weary fam-i-ly par-ty His were the shin-bones of the sa-line beef his would have been the drum-sticks For Flask to have pre-sumed to help him-self this must have seemed to him tan-ta-mount to larce-ny in the first de-gree Had he helped him-self at that table doubt-less nev-er more would he have been able to hold his head up in this hon-est world nev-er-the-less strange to say Ahab nev-er for-bade him And had Flask helped him-self the chances were Ahab had nev-er so much as no-ticed it Least of all did Flask pre-sume to help him-self to but-ter Whether he thought the own-ers of the ship de-nied it to him on ac-count of its clot-ting his clear sun-ny com-plex-ion or whether he deemed that on so long a voy-age in such mar-ket-less waters but-ter was at a premi-um and there-fore was not for him a subal-tern how-ev-er it was Flask alas was a but-ter-less man Another thing Flask was the last per-son down at the din-ner and Flask is the first man up Con-sid-er For here-by Flaskâ s din-ner was bad-ly jammed in point of time Star-buck and Stubb both had the start of him and yet they al-so have the priv-i-lege of loung-ing in the rear If Stubb even who is but a peg higher than Flask hap-pens to have but a small ap-petite and soon shows symp-toms of con-clud-ing his repast then Flask must be-stir him-self he will not get more than three mouth-fuls that day for it is against holy usage for Stubb to pre-cede Flask to the deck There-fore it was that Flask once ad-mit-ted in pri-vate that ever since he had arisen to the dig-ni-ty of an of-fi-cer from that mo-ment he had nev-er known what it was to be other-wise than hun-gry more or less For what he ate did not so much relieve his hunger as keep it im-mor-tal in him Peace and sat-is-fac-tion thought Flask have for ever depart-ed from my stomach I am an of-fi-cer but how I wish I could fish a bit of old fash-ioned beef in the fore-cas-tle as I used to when I was be-fore the mast Thereâ s the fruits of pro-mo-tion now thereâ s the van-i-ty of glo-ry thereâ s the in-san-i-ty of life Be-sides if it were so that any mere sailor of the Pe-quod had a grudge against Flask in Flaskâ s of-fi-cial ca-pac-i-ty all that sailor had to do in order to ob-tain am-ple vengeance was to go aft at din-ner time and get a peep at Flask through the cabin sky light sit-ting sil-ly and dum-foundered be-fore aw-ful Ahab Now Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table in the Pe-quodâ s cabin After their depar-ture tak-ing place in in-vert-ed order to their ar-rival the can-vas cloth was cleared or rather was re-stored to some hur-ried order by the pal-lid ste-ward And then the three har-pooneers were bid-den to the feast they be-ing its resid-uary le-ga-tees They made a sort of tem-po-rary ser-vantsâ hall of the high and mighty cabin In strange con-trast to the hard-ly tol-er-a-ble con-straint and name-less in-vis-i-ble dom-i-neer-ings of the cap-tainâ s table was the en-tire care free li-cense and ease the al-most fran-tic democ-ra-cy of those in-fe-ri-or fel-lows the har-pooneers While their masters the mates seemed afraid of the sound of the hinges of their own jaws the har-pooneers chewed their food with such a rel-ish that there was a re-port to it They dined like lords they filled their bel-lies like In-di-an ships all day load-ing with spices Such por-ten-tous ap-petites had Quee-queg and Tashtego that to fill out the va-can-cies made by the pre-vi-ous repast often the pale Dough Boy was fain to bring on a great baron of salt junk seem-ing-ly quar-ried out of the sol-id ox And if he were not live-ly about it if he did not go with a nim-ble hop skip and jump then Tashtego had an un-gentle-man-ly way of ac-cel-er-at-ing him by dart-ing a fork at his back har-poon wise And once Dag-goo seized with a sud-den hu-mor as-sist-ed Dough Boyâ s me-mory by snatch-ing him up bodi-ly and thrust-ing his head in-to a great emp-ty wood-en trencher while Tashtego knife in hand be-gan lay-ing out the cir-cle pre-lim-i-nary to scalp-ing him He was nat-u-ral-ly a very ner-vous shud-der-ing sort of lit-tle fel-low this bread faced ste-ward the proge-ny of a bankrupt bak-er and a hospi-tal nurse And what with the stand-ing spec-ta-cle of the black ter-rif-ic Ahab and the pe-ri-od-i-cal tu-mul-tuous visi-ta-tions of th-ese three sav-ages Dough Boyâ s whole life was one con-tin-u-al lip quiver Com-mon-ly after see-ing the har-pooneers fur-nished with all things they de-mand-ed he would es-cape from their clutch-es in-to his lit-tle pantry ad-join-ing and fear-ful-ly peep out at them through the blinds of its door till all was over It was a sight to see Quee-queg seat-ed over against Tashtego op-pos-ing his filed teeth to the In-di-anâ s cross-wise to them Dag-goo seat-ed on the floor for a bench would have brought his hearse plumed head to the low car-lines at every mo-tion of his colos-sal lim-bs mak-ing the low cabin frame-work to shake as when an African ele-phant goes pas-sen-ger in a ship But for all this the great ne-gro was won-der-ful-ly ab-stemious not to say dain-ty It seemed hard-ly pos-si-ble that by such com-par-a-tive-ly small mouth-fuls he could keep up the vi-tal-i-ty dif-fused through so broad ba-ro-nial and su-perb a per-son But doubt-less this noble sav-age fed strong and drank deep of the abound-ing ele-ment of air and through his di-lat-ed nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds Not by beef or by bread are giants made or nour-ished But Quee-queg he had a mor-tal bar-bar-ic smack of the lip in eat-ingâ an ug-ly sound enoughâ so much so that the trem-bling Dough Boy al-most looked to see whether any marks of teeth lurked in his own lean ar-ms And when he would hear Tashtego sing-ing out for him to pro-duce him-self that his bones might be picked the sim-ple wit-ted ste-ward all but shat-tered the crock-ery hang-ing round him in the pantry by his sud-den fits of the pal-sy Nor did the whet-stone which the har-pooneers car-ried in their pock-ets for their lances and other weapons and with which whet-stones at din-ner they would os-ten-ta-tious-ly sharp-en their knives that grat-ing sound did not at all tend to tran-quil-lize poor Dough Boy How could he for-get that in his Is-land days Quee-queg for one must cer-tain-ly have been guilty of some mur-der-ous con-vivial indis-cre-tions Alas Dough Boy hard fares the white waiter who waits upon can-ni-bals Not a nap-kin should he car-ry on his arm but a buck-ler In good time though to his great de-light the three salt sea war-riors would rise and depart to his cred-u-lous fable mon-ger-ing ears all their mar-tial bones jin-gling in them at every step like Moor-ish scimetars in scab-bards But though th-ese bar-bar-ians dined in the cabin and nom-i-nal-ly lived there still be-ing any-thing but se-den-tary in their habits they were scarce-ly ever in it ex-cept at meal-times and just be-fore sleep-ing time when they passed through it to their own pe-cu-liar quar-ters In this one mat-ter Ahab seemed no ex-cep-tion to most Amer-i-can whale cap-tains who as a set rather in-cline to the opin-ion that by rights the shipâ s cabin be-longs to them and that it is by cour-tesy alone that any-body else is at any time per-mit-ted there So that in real truth the mates and har-pooneers of the Pe-quod might more prop-er-ly be said to have lived out of the cabin than in it For when they did en-ter it it was some-thing as a street door en-ters a house turn-ing in-wards for a mo-ment on-ly to be turned out the next and as a per-ma-nent thing re-sid-ing in the open air Nor did they lose much here-by in the cabin was no com-pan-ion-ship so-cial-ly Ahab was inac-ces-si-ble Though nom-i-nal-ly in-clud-ed in the cen-sus of Chris-ten-dom he was still an alien to it He lived in the world as the last of the Gris-ly Bears lived in set-tled Mis-souri And as when Spring and Sum-mer had depart-ed that wild Lo-gan of the woods bury-ing him-self in the hol-low of a tree lived out the win-ter there suck-ing his own paws so in his in-clement howl-ing old age Ahabâ s soul shut up in the caved trunk of his body there fed upon the sullen paws of its gloom CHAPTER 35 The Mast Head It was dur-ing the more pleas-ant weather that in due ro-ta-tion with the other sea-men my first mast head came round In most Amer-i-can whale-men the mast heads are manned al-most si-mul-ta-ne-ous-ly with the ves-selâ s leav-ing her port even though she may have fif-teen thou-sand miles and more to sail ere reach-ing her prop-er cruis-ing ground And if after a three four or five yearsâ voy-age she is draw-ing nigh home with any-thing emp-ty in herâ say an emp-ty vial evenâ then her mast heads are kept manned to the last and not till her sky-sail poles sail in among the spires of the port does she al-to-geth-er relin-quish the hope of cap-tur-ing one whale more Now as the busi-ness of stand-ing mast heads ashore or afloat is a very an-cient and in-ter-est-ing one let us in some mea-sure ex-pa-ti-ate here I take it that the ear-li-est standers of mast heads were the old Egyp-tians be-cause in all my re-search-es I find none pri-or to them For though their pro-gen-i-tors the builders of Ba-bel must doubt-less by their tow-er have in-tend-ed to rear the lofti-est mast head in all Asia or Africa either yet ere the fi-nal truck was put to it as that great stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board in the dread gale of Godâ s wrath there-fore we can-not give th-ese Ba-bel builders pri-or-i-ty over the Egyp-tians And that the Egyp-tians were a na-tion of mast head standers is an asser-tion based upon the gen-er-al belief among archÃ ol-o-gists that the first pyra-mids were found-ed for astro-nom-i-cal pur-pos-es a the-o-ry sin-gu-lar-ly sup-port-ed by the pe-cu-liar stair like for-ma-tion of all four sides of those ed-i-fices where-by with prodi-gious long uplift-ings of their legs those old astronomers were wont to mount to the apex and sing out for new stars even as the look outs of a modern ship sing out for a sail or a whale just bear-ing in sight In Saint Stylites the fa-mous Chris-tian her-mit of old times who built him a lofty stone pil-lar in the desert and spent the whole lat-ter por-tion of his life on its sum-mit hoist-ing his food from the ground with a tack-le in him we have a re-mark-able in-stance of a daunt-less stander of mast heads who was not to be driv-en from his place by fogs or frosts rain hail or sleet but valiant-ly fac-ing every-thing out to the last lit-er-al-ly died at his post Of modern standers of mast heads we have but a life-less set mere stone iron and bronze men who though well ca-pable of fac-ing out a stiff gale are still en-tire-ly in-com-pe-tent to the busi-ness of sing-ing out upon dis-cov-er-ing any strange sight There is Napoleon who upon the top of the col-umn of Ven-dome stands with ar-ms fold-ed some one hun-dred and fifty feet in the air care-less now who rules the decks below whether Louis Philippe Louis Blanc or Louis the Devil Great Wash-ing-ton too stands high aloft on his tow-er-ing main mast in Bal-ti-more and like one of Her-culesâ pil-lars his col-umn marks that point of hu-man gran-deur beyond which few mor-tals will go Ad-mi-ral Nel-son al-so on a cap-stan of gun me-tal stands his mast head in Trafal-gar Square and ever when most ob-scured by that Lon-don smoke to-ken is yet giv-en that a hid-den hero is there for where there is smoke must be fire But nei-ther great Wash-ing-ton nor Napoleon nor Nel-son will an-swer a sin-gle hail from below how-ev-er mad-ly in-voked to be-friend by their coun-sels the dis-tract-ed decks upon which they gaze how-ev-er it may be sur-mised that their spir-its pen-e-trate through the thick haze of the fu-ture and de-scry what shoals and what rocks must be shunned It may seem un-war-rantable to cou-ple in any re-spect the mast head standers of the land with those of the sea but that in truth it is not so is plain-ly evinced by an item for which Obed Ma-cy the sole his-to-ri-an of Nan-tuck-et stands ac-count-able The wor-thy Obed tel-ls us that in the ear-ly times of the whale fish-ery ere ships were reg-u-lar-ly launched in pur-suit of the game the peo-ple of that is-land erect-ed lofty spars along the sea coast to which the look outs as-cend-ed by means of nailed cleats some-thing as fowls go up-stairs in a hen house A few years ago this same plan was adopt-ed by the Bay whale-men of New Zealand who upon de-scry-ing the game gave no-tice to the ready manned boats nigh the beach But this cus-tom has now be-come ob-so-lete turn we then to the one prop-er mast head that of a whale ship at sea The three mast heads are kept manned from sun rise to sun set the sea-men tak-ing their reg-u-lar turns as at the helm and reliev-ing each other every two hours In the serene weather of the trop-ics it is ex-ceed-ing-ly pleas-ant the mast head nay to a dreamy med-i-ta-tive man it is de-light-ful There you stand a hun-dred feet above the si-lent decks strid-ing along the deep as if the masts were gi-gan-tic stilts while be-neath you and between your legs as it were swim the hugest mon-sters of the sea even as ships once sailed between the boots of the fa-mous Colos-sus at old Rhodes There you stand lost in the in-fi-nite series of the sea with noth-ing ruf-fled but the waves The tranced ship in-do-lent-ly rol-ls the drowsy trade winds blow every-thing re-solves you in-to lan-guor For the most part in this trop-ic whal-ing life a sublime un-event-ful-ness in-vests you you hear no news read no gazettes ex-tras with startling ac-coun-ts of com-mon-places nev-er de-lude you in-to un-nec-es-sary ex-cite-men-ts you hear of no do-mes-tic af-flic-tions bankrupt se-cu-ri-ties fall of stocks are nev-er trou-bled with the thought of what you shall have for din-nerâ for all your meals for three years and more are snug-ly stowed in casks and your bill of fare is im-mutable In one of those south-ern whales-men on a long three or four yearsâ voy-age as often hap-pens the sum of the var-i-ous hours you spend at the mast head would amount to sev-er-al en-tire months And it is much to be de-plored that the place to which you devote so con-sid-er-able a por-tion of the whole term of your nat-u-ral life should be so sad-ly desti-tute of any-thing ap-proach-ing to a cosy in-hab-itive-ness or adapt-ed to breed a com-fort-able lo-cal-ness of feel-ing such as per-tains to a bed a ham-mock a hearse a sen-try box a pul-pit a coach or any other of those small and snug con-trivances in which men tem-porar-i-ly iso-late them-selves Your most usu-al point of perch is the head of the tâ gal-lant mast where you stand upon two thin par-al-lel sticks al-most pe-cu-liar to whale-men called the tâ gal-lant cross trees Here tossed about by the sea the begin-ner feels about as cosy as he would stand-ing on a bul-lâ s horns To be sure in cold weather you may car-ry your house aloft with you in the shape of a watch coat but prop-er-ly speak-ing the thick-est watch coat is no more of a house than the un-clad body for as the soul is glued in-side of its fleshy taber-na-cle and can-not freely move about in it nor even move out of it without run-ning great risk of per-ish-ing like an ig-no-rant pil-grim cross-ing the snowy Alps in win-ter so a watch coat is not so much of a house as it is a mere en-ve-lope or ad-di-tion-al skin en-cas-ing you You can-not put a shelf or ch-est of draw-ers in your body and no more can you make a con-ve-nient clos-et of your watch coat Con-cern-ing all this it is much to be de-plored that the mast heads of a south-ern whale ship are un-pro-vid-ed with those en-vi-able lit-tle ten-ts or pul-pits called crowâ s nests in which the look outs of a Green-land whaler are pro-tect-ed from the in-clement weather of the frozen seas In the fire-side nar-ra-tive of Cap-tain Sleet en-ti-tled â A Voy-age among the Ice-bergs in quest of the Green-land Whale and in-ci-den-tal-ly for the re dis-cov-ery of the Lost Ice-landic Colonies of Old Green-land â in this ad-mirable vol-ume all standers of mast heads are fur-nished with a charm-ing-ly cir-cum-stan-tial ac-count of the then re-cent-ly in-vent-ed crowâ s nest of the Glacier which was the name of Cap-tain Sleetâ s good craft He called it the Sleetâ s crowâ s nest in honor of him-self he be-ing the orig-i-nal in-ven-tor and pa-ten-tee and free from all ridicu-lous false del-i-ca-cy and hold-ing that if we call our own chil-dren after our own names we fathers be-ing the orig-i-nal in-ven-tors and pa-ten-tees so like-wise should we denom-i-nate after our-selves any other ap-pa-ra-tus we may beget In shape the Sleetâ s crowâ s nest is some-thing like a large tierce or pipe it is open above how-ev-er where it is fur-nished with a mov-able side screen to keep to wind-ward of your head in a hard gale Be-ing fixed on the sum-mit of the mast you as-cend in-to it through a lit-tle trap hatch in the bot-tom On the after side or side next the stern of the ship is a com-fort-able seat with a lock-er un-derneath for um-brel-las com-forters and coats In front is a leather rack in which to keep your speak-ing trum-pet pipe te-le-scope and other nau-ti-cal con-ve-niences When Cap-tain Sleet in per-son stood his mast head in this crowâ s nest of his he tel-ls us that he al-ways had a ri-fle with him al-so fixed in the rack to-geth-er with a pow-der flask and shot for the pur-pose of pop-ping off the stray nar-whales or va-grant sea uni-corns in-fest-ing those waters for you can-not suc-cess-ful-ly shoot at them from the deck owing to the re-sis-tance of the water but to shoot down upon them is a very dif-fer-ent thing Now it was plain-ly a la-bor of love for Cap-tain Sleet to de-scribe as he does all the lit-tle de-tailed con-ve-niences of his crowâ s nest but though he so en-larges upon many of th-ese and though he treats us to a very sci-en-tif-ic ac-count of his ex-per-i-men-ts in this crowâ s nest with a small com-pass he kept there for the pur-pose of coun-ter-act-ing the er-rors re-sult-ing from what is called the â lo-cal at-trac-tionâ of all bin-na-cle mag-nets an er-ror ascrib-able to the hor-i-zon-tal vicin-i-ty of the iron in the shipâ s planks and in the Glacierâ s case per-haps to there hav-ing been so many bro-ken down black-smiths among her crew I say that though the Cap-tain is very dis-creet and sci-en-tif-ic here yet for all his learned â bin-na-cle de-vi-a-tions â â az-imuth com-pass ob-ser-va-tions â and â ap-prox-i-mate er-rors â he knows very well Cap-tain Sleet that he was not so much im-mersed in those pro-found mag-net-ic med-i-ta-tions as to fail be-ing at-tract-ed oc-ca-sion-al-ly towards that well re-plen-ished lit-tle case bot-tle so nice-ly tucked in on one side of his crowâ s nest within easy reach of his hand Though upon the whole I great-ly ad-mire and even love the brave the hon-est and learned Cap-tain yet I take it very ill of him that he should so ut-ter-ly ig-nore that case bot-tle see-ing what a faith-ful friend and com-forter it must have been while with mit-tened fingers and hood-ed head he was study-ing the math-e-mat-ics aloft there in that birdâ s nest within three or four perch-es of the pole But if we South-ern whale fish-ers are not so snug-ly housed aloft as Cap-tain Sleet and his Green-land-men were yet that disad-van-tage is great-ly counter balanced by the wide-ly con-trast-ing seren-i-ty of those se-duc-tive seas in which we South fish-ers most-ly float For one I used to lounge up the rig-ging very leisure-ly rest-ing in the top to have a chat with Quee-queg or any one else off du-ty whom I might find there then as-cend-ing a lit-tle way fur-ther and throw-ing a lazy leg over the top sail yard take a pre-lim-i-nary view of the watery pas-tures and so at last mount to my ul-ti-mate desti-na-tion Let me make a clean breast of it here and frankly ad-mit that I kept but sor-ry guard With the prob-lem of the uni-verse re-volv-ing in me how could Iâ be-ing left com-plete-ly to my-self at such a thought en-gen-der-ing alti-tudeâ how could I but light-ly hold my obli-ga-tions to ob-serve all whale ship-sâ stand-ing orders â Keep your weather eye open and sing out every time â And let me in this place mov-ing-ly ad-mon-ish you ye ship own-ers of Nan-tuck-et Be-ware of en-list-ing in your vig-i-lant fish-eries any lad with lean brow and hol-low eye giv-en to unsea-son-able med-i-ta-tive-ness and who of-fers to ship with the PhÃ don in-stead of Bowditch in his head Be-ware of such an one I say your whales must be seen be-fore they can be killed and this sunken eyed young Pla-ton-ist will tow you ten wakes round the world and nev-er make you one pint of sperm the rich-er Nor are th-ese mo-ni-tions at all un-need-ed For nowa-days the whale fish-ery fur-nish-es an asy-lum for many ro-man-tic me-lan-choly and ab-sent mind-ed young men dis-gust-ed with the cark-ing cares of earth and seek-ing sen-ti-ment in tar and blub-ber Childe Harold not un-fre-quent-ly perch-es him-self upon the mast head of some luck-less dis-ap-point-ed whale ship and in moody phrase ejac-u-lates â â Roll on thou deep and dark blue ocean roll Ten thou-sand blub-ber hun-ters sweep over thee in vain â Very often do the cap-tains of such ships take those ab-sent mind-ed young philoso-phers to task up-braid-ing them with not feel-ing suf-fi-cient â in-ter-estâ in the voy-age half hint-ing that they are so hope-less-ly lost to all honor-able am-bi-tion as that in their se-cret souls they would rather not see whales than other-wise But all in vain those young Pla-ton-ists have a no-tion that their vi-sion is im-per-fect they are short sight-ed what use then to strain the visu-al nerve They have left their opera glass-es at home â Why thou mon-key â said a har-pooneer to one of th-ese lads â weâ ve been cruis-ing now hard upon three years and thou hast not raised a whale yet Whales are scarce as henâ s teeth when-ev-er thou art up here â Per-haps they were or per-haps there might have been shoals of them in the far hori-zon but lulled in-to such an opi-um like list-less-ness of va-cant un-con-scious rev-er-ie is this ab-sent mind-ed youth by the blend-ing cadence of waves with thoughts that at last he los-es his iden-ti-ty takes the mys-tic ocean at his feet for the vis-i-ble image of that deep blue bot-tom-less soul per-vad-ing mankind and na-ture and every strange half seen glid-ing beau-ti-ful thing that eludes him every dim-ly dis-cov-ered upris-ing fin of some undis-cernible form seems to him the em-bod-i-ment of those elu-sive thoughts that on-ly peo-ple the soul by con-tin-u-al-ly flit-ting through it In this en-chant-ed mood thy spir-it eb-bs away to whence it came be-comes dif-fused through time and space like Cran-merâ s sprin-kled Pan-the-is-tic ash-es form-ing at last a part of every shore the round globe over There is no life in thee now ex-cept that rock-ing life im-part-ed by a gent-ly rolling ship by her bor-rowed from the sea by the sea from the in-scrutable tides of God But while this sleep this dream is on ye move your foot or hand an inch slip your hold at all and your iden-ti-ty comes back in hor-ror Over Descar-tian vor-tices you hover And per-haps at mid day in the fairest weather with one half throt-tled shriek you drop through that trans-par-ent air in-to the sum-mer sea no more to rise for ever Heed it well ye Pan-the-ists CHAPTER 36 The Quar-ter Deck En-ter Ahab Then all It was not a great while after the af-fair of the pipe that one morn-ing short-ly after break-fast Ahab as was his wont as-cend-ed the cabin gang-way to the deck There most sea cap-tains usu-al-ly walk at that hour as coun-try gentle-men after the same meal take a few turns in the gar-den Soon his steady ivory stride was heard as to and fro he paced his old rounds upon planks so fa-mil-iar to his tread that they were all over dent-ed like ge-o-log-i-cal stones with the pe-cu-liar mark of his walk Did you fixed-ly gaze too upon that ribbed and dent-ed brow there al-so you would see still stranger foot printsâ the foot prin-ts of his one unsleep-ing ever pac-ing thought But on the oc-ca-sion in ques-tion those den-ts looked deep-er even as his ner-vous step that morn-ing left a deep-er mark And so full of his thought was Ahab that at every uni-form turn that he made now at the main mast and now at the bin-na-cle you could al-most see that thought turn in him as he turned and pace in him as he paced so com-plete-ly possess-ing him in-deed that it all but seemed the in-ward mould of every outer move-ment â Dâ ye mark him Flask â whis-pered Stubb â the chick thatâ s in him pecks the shell â Twill soon be out â The hours wore on â Ahab now shut up within his cabin anon pac-ing the deck with the same in-tense big-otry of pur-pose in his aspect It drew near the close of day Sud-den-ly he came to a halt by the bul-warks and insert-ing his bone leg in-to the auger hole there and with one hand grasp-ing a shroud he ordered Star-buck to send every-body aft â Sir â said the mate as-ton-ished at an order sel-dom or nev-er giv-en on ship board ex-cept in some ex-traor-di-nary case â Send every-body aft â re-peat-ed Ahab â Mast heads there come down â When the en-tire shipâ s com-pa-ny were assem-bled and with cu-ri-ous and not whol-ly unap-pre-hen-sive faces were eye-ing him for he looked not un-like the weather hori-zon when a storm is com-ing up Ahab after rapid-ly glanc-ing over the bul-warks and then dart-ing his eyes among the crew start-ed from his stand-point and as though not a soul were nigh him re-sumed his heavy turns upon the deck With bent head and half slouched hat he con-tin-ued to pace un-mind-ful of the won-der-ing whis-per-ing among the men till Stubb cau-tious-ly whis-pered to Flask that Ahab must have sum-moned them there for the pur-pose of wit-ness-ing a pedes-tri-an feat But this did not last long Ve-he-ment-ly paus-ing he cried â â What do ye do when ye see a whale men â â Sing out for him â was the im-pul-sive re-join-der from a score of clubbed voic-es â Good â cried Ahab with a wild ap-proval in his tones ob-serv-ing the hearty an-i-ma-tion in-to which his un-ex-pect-ed ques-tion had so mag-net-i-cal-ly thrown them â And what do ye next men â â Low-er away and after him â â And what tune is it ye pull to men â â A dead whale or a stove boat â More and more strange-ly and fierce-ly glad and ap-prov-ing grew the coun-te-nance of the old man at every shout while the mariners be-gan to gaze cu-ri-ous-ly at each other as if marvel-ling how it was that they them-selves be-came so ex-cit-ed at such seem-ing-ly pur-pose-less ques-tions But they were all eager-ness again as Ahab now half re-volv-ing in his piv-ot hole with one hand reach-ing high up a shroud and tight-ly al-most con-vul-sive-ly grasp-ing it ad-dressed them thus â â All ye mast head-ers have be-fore now heard me give orders about a white whale Look ye dâ ye see this Span-ish ounce of gold â â hold-ing up a broad bright coin to the sunâ â it is a six-teen dol-lar piece men Dâ ye see it Mr Star-buck hand me yon top maul â While the mate was get-ting the ham-mer Ahab without speak-ing was slow-ly rub-bing the gold piece against the skirts of his jack-et as if to height-en its lus-tre and without us-ing any words was mean-while low-ly hum-ming to him-self pro-duc-ing a sound so strange-ly muf-fled and inar-tic-u-late that it seemed the me-chan-i-cal hum-ming of the wheels of his vi-tal-i-ty in him Re-ceiv-ing the top maul from Star-buck he ad-vanced towards the main mast with the ham-mer uplift-ed in one hand ex-hibit-ing the gold with the other and with a high raised voice ex-claim-ing â Whoso-ev-er of ye rais-es me a white head-ed whale with a wrin-kled brow and a crooked jaw whoso-ev-er of ye rais-es me that white head-ed whale with three holes punc-tured in his star-board flukeâ look ye whoso-ev-er of ye rais-es me that same white whale he shall have this gold ounce my boys â â Huz-za huz-za â cried the sea-men as with swing-ing tarpaulins they hailed the act of nail-ing the gold to the mast â Itâ s a white whale I say â re-sumed Ahab as he threw down the top-maul â a white whale Skin your eyes for him men look sharp for white water if ye see but a bub-ble sing out â All this while Tashtego Dag-goo and Quee-queg had looked on with even more in-tense in-ter-est and sur-prise than the rest and at the men-tion of the wrin-kled brow and crooked jaw they had start-ed as if each was separate-ly touched by some spe-cif-ic recol-lec-tion â Cap-tain Ahab â said Tashtego â that white whale must be the same that some call Mo-by Dick â â Mo-by Dick â shout-ed Ahab â Do ye know the white whale then Tash â â Does he fan tail a lit-tle cu-ri-ous sir be-fore he goes down â said the Gay Head-er de-lib-er-ate-ly â And has he a cu-ri-ous spout too â said Dag-goo â very bushy even for a par-ma-cetty and mighty quick Cap-tain Ahab â â And he have one two threeâ oh good many iron in him hide too Cap-tain â cried Quee-queg disjoint-ed-ly â all twiske tee be twisk like himâ himâ â fal-ter-ing hard for a word and screw-ing his hand round and round as though un-cork-ing a bot-tleâ â like himâ himâ â â Corkscrew â cried Ahab â aye Quee-queg the har-poons lie all twist-ed and wrenched in him aye Dag-goo his spout is a big one like a whole shock of wheat and white as a pile of our Nan-tuck-et wool after the great an-nu-al sheep shear-ing aye Tashtego and he fan tails like a split jib in a squall Death and devils men it is Mo-by Dick ye have seenâ Mo-by Dickâ Mo-by Dick â â Cap-tain Ahab â said Star-buck who with Stubb and Flask had thus far been eye-ing his su-pe-ri-or with in-creas-ing sur-prise but at last seemed struck with a thought which some-what ex-plained all the won-der â Cap-tain Ahab I have heard of Mo-by Dickâ but it was not Mo-by Dick that took off thy leg â â Who told thee that â cried Ahab then paus-ing â Aye Star-buck aye my hearties all round it was Mo-by Dick that dis-mast-ed me Mo-by Dick that brought me to this dead stump I stand on now Aye aye â he shout-ed with a ter-rif-ic loud an-i-mal sob like that of a heart strick-en moose â Aye aye it was that ac-cursed white whale that razed me made a poor peg-ging lub-ber of me for ever and a day â Then toss-ing both ar-ms with mea-sure-less im-pre-ca-tions he shout-ed out â Aye aye and Iâ ll chase him round Good Hope and round the Horn and round the Nor-way Mael-strom and round perdi-tionâ s flames be-fore I give him up And this is what ye have shipped for men to chase that white whale on both sides of land and over all sides of earth till he spouts black blood and rol-ls fin out What say ye men will ye splice hands on it now I think ye do look brave â â Aye aye â shout-ed the har-pooneers and sea-men run-ning clos-er to the ex-cit-ed old man â A sharp eye for the white whale a sharp lance for Mo-by Dick â â God bless ye â he seemed to half sob and half shout â God bless ye men Ste-ward go draw the great mea-sure of grog But whatâ s this long face about Mr Star-buck wilt thou not chase the white whale art not game for Mo-by Dick â â I am game for his crooked jaw and for the jaws of Death too Cap-tain Ahab if it fair-ly comes in the way of the busi-ness we fol-low but I came here to hunt whales not my com-man-derâ s vengeance How many bar-rels will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it Cap-tain Ahab it will not fetch thee much in our Nan-tuck-et mar-ket â â Nan-tuck-et mar-ket Hoot But come clos-er Star-buck thou re-quirest a lit-tle low-er lay-er If moneyâ s to be the mea-surer man and the ac-coun-tan-ts have com-put-ed their great count-ing house the globe by girdling it with guineas one to every three parts of an inch then let me tell thee that my vengeance will fetch a great premi-um here â â He smites his ch-est â whis-pered Stubb â whatâ s that for me-thinks it rings most vast but hol-low â â Vengeance on a dumb brute â cried Star-buck â that sim-ply smote thee from blin-d-est in-stinct Mad-ness To be en-raged with a dumb thing Cap-tain Ahab seems blas-phe-mous â â Hark ye yet againâ the lit-tle low-er lay-er All vis-i-ble ob-jec-ts man are but as paste-board masks But in each even-tâ in the liv-ing act the un-doubt-ed deedâ there some un-known but still rea-son-ing thing puts forth the mould-ings of its fea-tures from be-hind the un-rea-son-ing mask If man will strike strike through the mask How can the prison-er reach out-side ex-cept by thrust-ing through the wall To me the white whale is that wall shoved near to me Some-times I think thereâ s naught beyond But â tis enough He tasks me he heaps me I see in him ou-tra-geous strength with an in-scrutable mal-ice sinew-ing it That in-scrutable thing is chiefly what I hate and be the white whale agent or be the white whale prin-ci-pal I will wreak that hate upon him Talk not to me of blas-phe-my man Iâ d strike the sun if it in-sult-ed me For could the sun do that then could I do the other since there is ever a sort of fair play here-in jeal-ousy pre-sid-ing over all creations But not my master man is even that fair play Whoâ s over me Truth hath no con-fines Take off thine eye more in-tol-er-a-ble than fiend-sâ glar-ings is a doltish stare So so thou red-den-est and palest my heat has melt-ed thee to anger glow But look ye Star-buck what is said in heat that thing un-says it-self There are men from whom warm words are small indig-ni-ty I meant not to in-cense thee Let it go Look see yon-der Turk-ish cheeks of spot-ted tawnâ liv-ing breath-ing pic-tures paint-ed by the sun The Pa-gan leop-ard-sâ the un-reck-ing and un-wor-ship-ping things that live and seek and give no rea-sons for the tor-rid life they feel The crew man the crew Are they not one and all with Ahab in this mat-ter of the whale See Stubb he laughs See yon-der Chil-ian he snorts to think of it Stand up amid the gen-er-al hur-ri-cane thy one tost sapling can-not Star-buck And what is it Reck-on it â Tis but to help strike a fin no won-drous feat for Star-buck What is it more From this one poor hunt then the best lance out of all Nan-tuck-et sure-ly he will not hang back when every fore-mast hand has clutched a whet-stone Ah con-strain-ings seize thee I see the bil-low lifts thee Speak but speak â Aye aye thy si-lence then that voic-es thee Aside Some-thing shot from my di-lat-ed nostrils he has in-haled it in his lungs Star-buck now is mine can-not op-pose me now without re-bel-lion â â God keep me â keep us all â mur-mured Star-buck low-ly But in his joy at the en-chant-ed tac-it ac-qui-es-cence of the mate Ahab did not hear his fore-bod-ing in-vo-ca-tion nor yet the low laugh from the hold nor yet the pre-sag-ing vi-bra-tions of the winds in the cordage nor yet the hol-low flap of the sails against the masts as for a mo-ment their hearts sank in For again Star-buckâ s down-cast eyes light-ed up with the stub-born-ness of life the subter-ranean laugh died away the winds blew on the sails filled out the ship heaved and rolled as be-fore Ah ye ad-mo-ni-tions and warn-ings why stay ye not when ye come But rather are ye pre-dic-tions than warn-ings ye shad-ows Yet not so much pre-dic-tions from without as ver-i-fi-ca-tions of the fore-go-ing things within For with lit-tle ex-ter-nal to con-strain us the in-ner-most ne-ces-si-ties in our be-ing th-ese still drive us on â The mea-sure the mea-sure â cried Ahab Re-ceiv-ing the brim-ming pewter and turn-ing to the har-pooneers he ordered them to pro-duce their weapons Then rang-ing them be-fore him near the cap-stan with their har-poons in their hands while his three mates stood at his side with their lances and the rest of the shipâ s com-pa-ny formed a cir-cle round the group he stood for an in-stant search-ing-ly eye-ing every man of his crew But those wild eyes met his as the blood-shot eyes of the prair-ie wolves meet the eye of their lead-er ere he rush-es on at their head in the trail of the bi-son but alas on-ly to fall in-to the hid-den snare of the In-di-an â Drink and pass â he cried hand-ing the heavy charged flagon to the near-est sea-man â The crew alone now drink Round with it round Short draught-sâ long swal-lows men â tis hot as Satanâ s hoof So so it goes round ex-cel-lent-ly It spi-ral-izes in ye forks out at the ser-pent snap-ping eye Well done al-most drained That way it went this way it comes Hand it meâ hereâ s a hol-low Men ye seem the years so brim-ming life is gulped and gone Ste-ward re-fill â At-tend now my braves I have mus-tered ye all round this cap-stan and ye mates flank me with your lances and ye har-pooneers stand there with your irons and ye stout mariners ring me in that I may in some sort re-vive a noble cus-tom of my fish-er-man fathers be-fore me O men you will yet see thatâ Ha boy come back bad pen-nies come not soon-er Hand it me Why now this pewter had run brim-ming again werâ t not thou St Vi-tusâ im-pâ away thou ague â Ad-vance ye mates Cross your lances full be-fore me Well done Let me touch the ax-is â So say-ing with ex-tend-ed arm he grasped the three lev-el ra-di-at-ing lances at their crossed cen-tre while so do-ing sud-den-ly and ner-vous-ly twitched them mean-while glanc-ing in-tent-ly from Star-buck to Stubb from Stubb to Flask It seemed as though by some name-less in-te-ri-or vo-li-tion he would fain have shocked in-to them the same fiery emo-tion ac-cu-mu-lat-ed within the Ley-den jar of his own mag-net-ic life The three mates quailed be-fore his strong sus-tained and mys-tic aspect Stubb and Flask looked side-ways from him the hon-est eye of Star-buck fell down-right â In vain â cried Ahab â but maybe â tis well For did ye three but once take the full forced shock then mine own elec-tric thing that had per-haps ex-pired from out me Per-chance too it would have dropped ye dead Per-chance ye need it not Down lances And now ye mates I do ap-point ye three cup-bear-ers to my three pa-gan kins-men thereâ yon three most honor-able gentle-men and noble-men my valiant har-pooneers Dis-dain the task What when the great Pope wash-es the feet of beg-gars us-ing his tiara for ew-er Oh my sweet car-di-nals your own con-de-scen-sion that shall bend ye to it I do not order ye ye will it Cut your seiz-ings and draw the poles ye har-pooneers â Si-lent-ly obey-ing the order the three har-pooneers now stood with the de-tached iron part of their har-poons some three feet long held bar-bs up be-fore him â Stab me not with that keen steel Cant them cant them over know ye not the goblet end Turn up the sock-et So so now ye cup bear-ers ad-vance The irons take them hold them while I fill â Forth-with slow-ly go-ing from one of-fi-cer to the other he brimmed the har-poon sock-ets with the fiery waters from the pewter â Now three to three ye stand Com-mend the mur-der-ous chal-ices Bestow them ye who are now made par-ties to this indis-sol-u-ble league Ha Star-buck but the deed is done Yon rat-i-fy-ing sun now waits to sit upon it Drink ye har-pooneers drink and swear ye men that man the death-ful whale-boatâ s bowâ Death to Mo-by Dick God hunt us all if we do not hunt Mo-by Dick to his death â The long barbed steel goblets were lift-ed and to cries and male-dic-tions against the white whale the spir-its were si-mul-ta-ne-ous-ly quaffed down with a hiss Star-buck paled and turned and shivered Once more and fi-nal-ly the re-plen-ished pewter went the rounds among the fran-tic crew when wav-ing his free hand to them they all dis-persed and Ahab re-tired within his cabin CHAPTER 37 Sun-set The cabin by the stern win-dows Ahab sit-ting alone and gaz-ing out I leave a white and tur-bid wake pale waters paler cheeks whereâ er I sail The en-vi-ous bil-lows side-long swell to whelm my track let them but first I pass Yon-der by ever brim-ming gobletâ s rim the warm waves blush like wine The gold brow plum-bs the blue The div-er sunâ

CHAPTER 41 Mo-by Dick I Ish-mael was one of that crew my shouts had gone up with the rest my oath had been weld-ed with theirs and stronger I shout-ed and more did I ham-mer and clinch my oath be-cause of the dread in my soul A wild mys-ti-cal sym-pa-thet-i-cal feel-ing was in me Ahabâ s quench-less feud seemed mine With greedy ears I learned the his-to-ry of that mur-der-ous mon-ster against whom I and all the others had tak-en our oaths of vi-o-lence and re-venge For some time past though at in-ter-vals on-ly the unac-com-pa-nied se-clud-ed White Whale had haunt-ed those un-civ-i-lized seas most-ly fre-quent-ed by the Sperm Whale fish-er-men But not all of them knew of his ex-is-tence on-ly a few of them com-par-a-tive-ly had know-ing-ly seen him while the num-ber who as yet had ac-tu-al-ly and know-ing-ly giv-en bat-tle to him was small in-deed For owing to the large num-ber of whale cruis-ers the disor-der-ly way they were sprin-kled over the en-tire watery cir-cum-fer-ence many of them ad-ven-tur-ous-ly push-ing their quest along soli-tary lat-i-tudes so as sel-dom or nev-er for a whole twelve-month or more on a stretch to en-counter a sin-gle news telling sail of any sort the inor-di-nate length of each separate voy-age the ir-reg-u-lar-i-ty of the times of sail-ing from home all th-ese with other cir-cum-stances direct and indi-rect long ob-struct-ed the spread through the whole world wide whal-ing fleet of the spe-cial in-di-vid-u-al-iz-ing tid-ings con-cern-ing Mo-by Dick It was hard-ly to be doubt-ed that sev-er-al ves-sels re-port-ed to have en-coun-tered at such or such a time or on such or such a merid-i-an a Sperm Whale of un-com-mon mag-ni-tude and malig-ni-ty which whale after do-ing great mis-chief to his as-sailan-ts had com-plete-ly es-caped them to some minds it was not an un-fair pre-sump-tion I say that the whale in ques-tion must have been no other than Mo-by Dick Yet as of late the Sperm Whale fish-ery had been marked by var-i-ous and not un-fre-quent in-stances of great fe-roc-i-ty cun-ning and mal-ice in the mon-ster at-tacked there-fore it was that those who by ac-ci-dent ig-no-rant-ly gave bat-tle to Mo-by Dick such hun-ters per-haps for the most part were con-tent to ascribe the pe-cu-liar ter-ror he bred more as it were to the per-ils of the Sperm Whale fish-ery at large than to the in-di-vid-u-al cause In that way most-ly the disas-trous en-counter between Ahab and the whale had hither-to been pop-u-lar-ly re-gard-ed And as for those who pre-vi-ous-ly hear-ing of the White Whale by chance caught sight of him in the begin-ning of the thing they had every one of them al-most as bold-ly and fear-less-ly low-ered for him as for any other whale of that species But at length such calami-ties did en-sue in th-ese as-sault-sâ not restrict-ed to sprained wrists and an-kles bro-ken lim-bs or devour-ing am-pu-ta-tion-sâ but fatal to the last de-gree of fatal-i-ty those re-peat-ed disas-trous repuls-es all ac-cu-mu-lat-ing and pil-ing their ter-rors upon Mo-by Dick those things had gone far to shake the for-ti-tude of many brave hun-ters to whom the sto-ry of the White Whale had even-tu-al-ly come Nor did wild ru-mors of all sorts fail to ex-ag-ger-ate and still the more hor-ri-fy the true his-to-ries of th-ese dead-ly en-coun-ters For not on-ly do fab-u-lous ru-mors nat-u-ral-ly grow out of the very body of all sur-pris-ing ter-ri-ble even-ts â as the smit-ten tree gives birth to its fun-gi but in mar-itime life far more than in that of ter-ra fir-ma wild ru-mors abound wher-ev-er there is any ad-e-quate real-i-ty for them to cling to And as the sea sur-pass-es the land in this mat-ter so the whale fish-ery sur-pass-es every other sort of mar-itime life in the won-der-ful-ness and fear-ful-ness of the ru-mors which some-times cir-cu-late there For not on-ly are whale-men as a body unex-empt from that ig-no-rance and su-per-sti-tious-ness hered-i-tary to all sailors but of all sailors they are by all od-ds the most direct-ly brought in-to con-tact with what-ev-er is ap-palling-ly as-ton-ish-ing in the sea face to face they not on-ly eye its great-est marvels but hand to jaw give bat-tle to them Alone in such re-motest waters that though you sailed a thou-sand miles and passed a thou-sand shores you would not come to any chis-eled hearth stone or aught hospitable be-neath that part of the sun in such lat-i-tudes and lon-gi-tudes pur-su-ing too such a calling as he does the whale-man is wrapped by in-flu-ences all tend-ing to make his fan-cy preg-nant with many a mighty birth No won-der then that ever gather-ing vol-ume from the mere tran-sit over the widest watery spaces the out-blown ru-mors of the White Whale did in the end in-cor-po-rate with them-selves all man-ner of mor-bid hin-ts and half formed fÅ tal sugges-tions of su-per-nat-u-ral agen-cies which even-tu-al-ly in-vest-ed Mo-by Dick with new ter-rors un-bor-rowed from any-thing that vis-i-bly ap-pears So that in many cas-es such a pan-ic did he fi-nal-ly strike that few who by those ru-mors at least had heard of the White Whale few of those hun-ters were willing to en-counter the per-ils of his jaw But there were still other and more vi-tal prac-ti-cal in-flu-ences at work Not even at the pre-sent day has the orig-i-nal pres-tige of the Sperm Whale as fear-ful-ly distin-guished from all other species of the le-viathan died out of the minds of the whale-men as a body There are those this day among them who though in-tel-li-gent and coura-geous enough in of-fer-ing bat-tle to the Green-land or Right whale would per-hap-sâ either from pro-fes-sion-al in-ex-pe-ri-ence or in-com-pe-ten-cy or timid-i-ty de-cline a con-test with the Sperm Whale at any rate there are plen-ty of whale-men espe-cial-ly among those whal-ing na-tions not sail-ing un-der the Amer-i-can flag who have nev-er hos-tile-ly en-coun-tered the Sperm Whale but whose sole knowl-edge of the le-viathan is restrict-ed to the ig-no-ble mon-ster prim-i-tive-ly pur-sued in the North seat-ed on their hatch-es th-ese men will hear-ken with a child-ish fire-side in-ter-est and awe to the wild strange tales of South-ern whal-ing Nor is the pre emi-nent tre-men-dous-ness of the great Sperm Whale any-where more feel-ing-ly com-pre-hend-ed than on board of those prows which stem him And as if the now test-ed real-i-ty of his might had in former le-gendary times thrown its shad-ow be-fore it we find some book nat-u-ral-ist-sâ Olassen and Povel-sonâ declar-ing the Sperm Whale not on-ly to be a con-ster-na-tion to every other crea-ture in the sea but al-so to be so in-cred-i-bly fe-ro-cious as con-tin-u-al-ly to be athirst for hu-man blood Nor even down to so late a time as Cu-vierâ s were th-ese or al-most sim-i-lar im-pres-sions ef-faced For in his Nat-u-ral His-to-ry the Baron him-self af-fir-ms that at sight of the Sperm Whale all fish sharks in-clud-ed are â struck with the most live-ly ter-rors â and â often in the pre-cip-i-tan-cy of their flight dash them-selves against the rocks with such vi-o-lence as to cause in-stan-ta-neous death â And how-ev-er the gen-er-al ex-pe-ri-ences in the fish-ery may amend such re-ports as th-ese yet in their full ter-ri-ble-ness even to the blood-thirsty item of Povel-son the su-per-sti-tious belief in them is in some vi-cis-si-tudes of their vo-ca-tion re-vived in the minds of the hun-ters So that over-awed by the ru-mors and por-ten-ts con-cern-ing him not a few of the fish-er-men re-called in ref-er-ence to Mo-by Dick the ear-li-er days of the Sperm Whale fish-ery when it was of-ten-times hard to in-duce long prac-tised Right whale-men to em-bark in the per-ils of this new and dar-ing war-fare such men protest-ing that although other le-viathans might be hope-ful-ly pur-sued yet to chase and point lance at such an ap-pari-tion as the Sperm Whale was not for mor-tal man That to at-tempt it would be inevitably to be torn in-to a quick eter-ni-ty On this head there are some re-mark-able doc-u-men-ts that may be con-sult-ed Nev-er-the-less some there were who even in the face of th-ese things were ready to give chase to Mo-by Dick and a still greater num-ber who chanc-ing on-ly to hear of him dis-tant-ly and vague-ly without the spe-cif-ic de-tails of any cer-tain calami-ty and without su-per-sti-tious ac-com-pa-ni-men-ts were suf-fi-cient-ly hardy not to flee from the bat-tle if of-fered One of the wild sugges-tions re-ferred to as at last com-ing to be linked with the White Whale in the minds of the su-per-sti-tious-ly in-clined was the un-earth-ly con-ceit that Mo-by Dick was ubiq-ui-tous that he had ac-tu-al-ly been en-coun-tered in op-po-site lat-i-tudes at one and the same in-stant of time Nor cred-u-lous as such minds must have been was this con-ceit al-to-geth-er without some faint show of su-per-sti-tious prob-a-bil-i-ty For as the se-crets of the cur-ren-ts in the seas have nev-er yet been divulged even to the most eru-dite re-search so the hid-den ways of the Sperm Whale when be-neath the sur-face re-main in great part unac-count-able to his pur-suers and from time to time have orig-i-nat-ed the most cu-ri-ous and con-tra-dic-to-ry spec-u-la-tions re-gard-ing them espe-cial-ly con-cern-ing the mys-tic modes where-by after sound-ing to a great depth he trans-ports him-self with such vast swift-ness to the most wide-ly dis-tant poin-ts It is a thing well known to both Amer-i-can and English whale ships and as well a thing placed upon author-i-ta-tive record years ago by Scores-by that some whales have been cap-tured far north in the Pa-cif-ic in whose bodies have been found the bar-bs of har-poons dart-ed in the Green-land seas Nor is it to be gain-said that in some of th-ese in-stances it has been de-clared that the in-ter-val of time between the two as-saults could not have ex-ceed-ed very many days Hence by in-fer-ence it has been believed by some whale-men that the Norâ West Pas-sage so long a prob-lem to man was nev-er a prob-lem to the whale So that here in the real liv-ing ex-pe-ri-ence of liv-ing men the prodi-gies re-lat-ed in old times of the in-land Strel-lo moun-tain in Por-tu-gal near whose top there was said to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships float-ed up to the sur-face and that still more won-der-ful sto-ry of the Arethusa foun-tain near Syra-cuse whose waters were believed to have come from the Holy Land by an un-der-ground pas-sage th-ese fab-u-lous nar-ra-tions are al-most ful-ly equalled by the real-i-ties of the whale-men Forced in-to fa-mil-iar-i-ty then with such prodi-gies as th-ese and know-ing that after re-peat-ed in-trepid as-saults the White Whale had es-caped alive it can-not be much mat-ter of sur-prise that some whale-men should go still fur-ther in their su-per-sti-tions declar-ing Mo-by Dick not on-ly ubiq-ui-tous but im-mor-tal for im-mor-tal-i-ty is but ubiq-ui-ty in time that though groves of spears should be plant-ed in his flanks he would still swim away un-harmed or if in-deed he should ever be made to spout thick blood such a sight would be but a ghast-ly de-cep-tion for again in unen-san-guined bil-lows hun-dreds of leagues away his un-sul-lied jet would once more be seen But even stripped of th-ese su-per-nat-u-ral sur-mis-ings there was enough in the earth-ly make and in-con-testable char-ac-ter of the mon-ster to strike the imag-i-na-tion with un-wont-ed pow-er For it was not so much his un-com-mon bulk that so much distin-guished him from other sperm whales but as was else-where thrown outâ a pe-cu-liar snow white wrin-kled fore-head and a high pyra-midi-cal white hump Th-ese were his promi-nent fea-tures the to-kens where-by even in the lim-it-less un-chart-ed seas he re-vealed his iden-ti-ty at a long dis-tance to those who knew him The rest of his body was so streaked and spot-ted and mar-bled with the same shroud-ed hue that in the end he had gained his distinc-tive ap-pel-la-tion of the White Whale a name in-deed lit-er-al-ly jus-ti-fied by his vivid aspect when seen glid-ing at high noon through a dark blue sea leav-ing a milky way wake of creamy foam all span-gled with gold-en gleam-ings Nor was it his un-wont-ed mag-ni-tude nor his re-mark-able hue nor yet his de-formed low-er jaw that so much in-vest-ed the whale with nat-u-ral ter-ror as that unex-am-pled in-tel-li-gent malig-ni-ty which ac-cord-ing to spe-cif-ic ac-coun-ts he had over and over again evinced in his as-saults More than all his treach-er-ous re-treats struck more of dis-may than per-haps aught else For when swim-ming be-fore his ex-ult-ing pur-suers with every ap-par-ent symp-tom of alarm he had sev-er-al times been known to turn round sud-den-ly and bear-ing down upon them either stave their boats to splin-ters or drive them back in con-ster-na-tion to their ship Al-ready sev-er-al fatal-i-ties had at-tend-ed his chase But though sim-i-lar disas-ters how-ev-er lit-tle bruit-ed ashore were by no means unusu-al in the fish-ery yet in most in-stances such seemed the White Whaleâ s in-fer-nal afore-thought of fe-roc-i-ty that every dis-mem-ber-ing or death that he caused was not whol-ly re-gard-ed as hav-ing been in-flict-ed by an un-in-tel-li-gent agent Judge then to what pitch-es of in-flamed dis-tract-ed fury the minds of his more des-per-ate hun-ters were im-pelled when amid the chips of chewed boats and the sink-ing lim-bs of torn com-rades they swam out of the white cur-ds of the whaleâ s dire-ful wrath in-to the serene ex-as-per-at-ing sun-light that smiled on as if at a birth or a bri-dal His three boats stove around him and oars and men both whirling in the ed-dies one cap-tain seiz-ing the line knife from his bro-ken prow had dashed at the whale as an Arkansas duel-list at his foe blind-ly seek-ing with a six inch blade to reach the fath-om deep life of the whale That cap-tain was Ahab And then it was that sud-den-ly sweep-ing his sick-le shaped low-er jaw be-neath him Mo-by Dick had reaped away Ahabâ s leg as a mow-er a blade of grass in the field No tur-baned Turk no hired Vene-tian or Malay could have smote him with more seem-ing mal-ice Small rea-son was there to doubt then that ever since that al-most fatal en-counter Ahab had cher-ished a wild vin-dic-tive-ness against the whale all the more fell for that in his fran-tic mor-bid-ness he at last came to iden-ti-fy with him not on-ly all his bodi-ly woes but all his in-tel-lec-tu-al and spir-i-tu-al ex-as-per-a-tions The White Whale swam be-fore him as the mono-ma-ni-ac in-car-na-tion of all those ma-li-cious agen-cies which some deep men feel eat-ing in them till they are left liv-ing on with half a heart and half a lung That in-tan-gi-ble malig-ni-ty which has been from the begin-ning to whose do-min-ion even the modern Chris-tians ascribe one half of the worlds which the an-cient Ophites of the east rev-er-enced in their stat-ue devil â Ahab did not fall down and wor-ship it like them but deliri-ous-ly trans-fer-ring its idea to the ab-horred white whale he pit-ted him-self all mu-ti-lat-ed against it All that most mad-dens and tor-men-ts all that stirs up the lees of things all truth with mal-ice in it all that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain all the sub-tle de-monis-ms of life and thought all evil to crazy Ahab were vis-i-bly per-son-i-fied and made prac-ti-cal-ly as-sail-able in Mo-by Dick He piled upon the whaleâ s white hump the sum of all the gen-er-al rage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down and then as if his ch-est had been a mor-tar he burst his hot heartâ s shell upon it It is not prob-a-ble that this mono-ma-nia in him took its in-stant rise at the pre-cise time of his bodi-ly dis-mem-ber-ment Then in dart-ing at the mon-ster knife in hand he had but giv-en loose to a sud-den pas-sion-ate cor-po-ral an-i-mos-i-ty and when he re-ceived the stroke that tore him he prob-a-bly but felt the ago-niz-ing bodi-ly lac-er-a-tion but noth-ing more Yet when by this col-li-sion forced to turn towards home and for long months of days and weeks Ahab and an-guish lay stretched to-geth-er in one ham-mock round-ing in mid win-ter that dreary howl-ing Patag-o-ni-an Cape then it was that his torn body and gashed soul bled in-to one another and so in-ter-fus-ing made him mad That it was on-ly then on the home-ward voy-age after the en-counter that the fi-nal mono-ma-nia seized him seems all but cer-tain from the fact that at in-ter-vals dur-ing the pas-sage he was a rav-ing lu-natic and though un-limbed of a leg yet such vi-tal strength yet lurked in his Egyp-tian ch-est and was more-over in-ten-si-fied by his delir-i-um that his mates were forced to lace him fast even there as he sailed rav-ing in his ham-mock In a strait jack-et he swung to the mad rock-ings of the gales And when run-ning in-to more suf-fer-able lat-i-tudes the ship with mild stunâ sails spread float-ed across the tran-quil trop-ics and to all ap-pear-ances the old manâ s delir-i-um seemed left be-hind him with the Cape Horn swells and he came forth from his dark den in-to the blessed light and air even then when he bore that firm col-lect-ed front how-ev-er pale and is-sued his calm orders once again and his mates thanked God the dire-ful mad-ness was now gone even then Ahab in his hid-den self raved on Hu-man mad-ness is of-ten-times a cun-ning and most fe-line thing When you think it fled it may have but be-come trans-fig-ured in-to some still subtler form Ahabâ s full lu-na-cy sub-sid-ed not but deep-en-ing-ly con-tract-ed like the un-abat-ed Hud-son when that noble North-man flows nar-row-ly but un-fath-omably through the High-land gorge But as in his nar-row flow-ing mono-ma-nia not one jot of Ahabâ s broad mad-ness had been left be-hind so in that broad mad-ness not one jot of his great nat-u-ral in-tel-lect had per-ished That be-fore liv-ing agent now be-came the liv-ing in-stru-ment If such a fu-ri-ous trope may stand his spe-cial lu-na-cy stormed his gen-er-al san-i-ty and car-ried it and turned all its con-cen-tred can-non upon its own mad mark so that far from hav-ing lost his strength Ahab to that one end did now possess a thou-sand fold more po-ten-cy than ever he had sane-ly brought to bear upon any one rea-son-able ob-ject This is much yet Ahabâ s larg-er dark-er deep-er part re-mains un-hint-ed But vain to pop-u-lar-ize pro-fun-di-ties and all truth is pro-found Wind-ing far down from within the very heart of this spiked Ho-tel de Cluny where we here standâ how-ev-er grand and won-der-ful now quit it â and take your way ye nobler sad-der souls to those vast Ro-man hal-ls of Ther-mes where far be-neath the fan-tas-tic tow-ers of manâ s up-per earth his root of gran-deur his whole aw-ful essence sits in beard-ed state an an-tique buried be-neath an-tiq-ui-ties and throned on tor-soes So with a bro-ken throne the great gods mock that cap-tive king so like a Cary-atid he pa-tient sits uphold-ing on his frozen brow the piled entab-la-tures of ages Wind ye down there ye proud-er sad-der souls ques-tion that proud sad king A fam-i-ly like-ness aye he did beget ye ye young ex-iled roy-al-ties and from your grim sire on-ly will the old State se-cret come Now in his heart Ahab had some glimpse of this name-ly all my means are sane my mo-tive and my ob-ject mad Yet without pow-er to kill or change or shun the fact he like-wise knew that to mankind he did long dis-sem-ble in some sort did still But that thing of his dis-sem-bling was on-ly sub-ject to his per-cep-ti-bil-i-ty not to his will deter-mi-nate Nev-er-the-less so well did he suc-ceed in that dis-sem-bling that when with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last no Nan-tuck-eter thought him other-wise than but nat-u-ral-ly grieved and that to the quick with the ter-ri-ble ca-su-al-ty which had over-tak-en him The re-port of his un-de-ni-able delir-i-um at sea was like-wise pop-u-lar-ly ascribed to a kin-dred cause And so too all the added mood-i-ness which al-ways after-wards to the very day of sail-ing in the Pe-quod on the pre-sent voy-age sat brood-ing on his brow Nor is it so very un-like-ly that far from distrust-ing his fit-ness for another whal-ing voy-age on ac-count of such dark symp-toms the cal-cu-lat-ing peo-ple of that pru-dent isle were in-clined to har-bor the con-ceit that for those very rea-sons he was all the bet-ter qual-i-fied and set on edge for a pur-suit so full of rage and wild-ness as the bloody hunt of whales Gnawed within and scorched without with the in-fixed un-re-lent-ing fangs of some in-cur-able idea such an one could he be found would seem the very man to dart his iron and lift his lance against the most ap-palling of all brutes Or if for any rea-son thought to be cor-po-re-al-ly in-ca-pac-i-tat-ed for that yet such an one would seem su-perla-tive-ly com-pe-tent to cheer and howl on his un-der-lings to the at-tack But be all this as it may cer-tain it is that with the mad se-cret of his un-abat-ed rage bolt-ed up and keyed in him Ahab had pur-pose-ly sailed upon the pre-sent voy-age with the one on-ly and all en-gross-ing ob-ject of hunt-ing the White Whale Had any one of his old ac-quain-tances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurk-ing in him then how soon would their aghast and righ-teous souls have wrenched the ship from such a fiendish man They were bent on profitable cruis-es the profit to be count-ed down in dol-lars from the mint He was in-tent on an au-da-cious im-mit-i-ga-ble and su-per-nat-u-ral re-venge Here then was this grey head-ed un-god-ly old man chas-ing with curs-es a Jobâ s whale round the world at the head of a crew too chiefly made up of mon-grel rene-gades and cast-aways and can-ni-bal-sâ mo-ral-ly en-fee-bled al-so by the in-com-pe-tence of mere unaid-ed virtue or right mind-ed-ness in Star-buck the in-vul-ner-a-ble jol-li-ty of in-dif-fer-ence and reck-less-ness in Stubb and the per-vad-ing me-di-ocrity in Flask Such a crew so of-fi-cered seemed spe-cial-ly picked and packed by some in-fer-nal fatal-i-ty to help him to his mono-ma-ni-ac re-venge How it was that they so abound-ing-ly re-spond-ed to the old manâ s ireâ by what evil mag-ic their souls were possessed that at times his hate seemed al-most theirs the White Whale as much their in-suf-fer-able foe as his how all this came to beâ what the White Whale was to them or how to their un-con-scious un-der-stand-ings al-so in some dim un-sus-pect-ed way he might have seemed the glid-ing great de-mon of the seas of life â all this to ex-plain would be to dive deep-er than Ish-mael can go The subter-ranean min-er that works in us all how can one tell whith-er leads his shaft by the ever shift-ing muf-fled sound of his pick Who does not feel the ir-re-sistible arm drag What sk-iff in tow of a seven-ty four can stand still For one I gave my-self up to the aban-don-ment of the time and the place but while yet all a rush to en-counter the whale could see naught in that brute but the dead-li-est ill CHAPTER 42 The White-ness of the Whale What the white whale was to Ahab has been hint-ed what at times he was to me as yet re-mains un-said Aside from those more ob-vi-ous con-sid-er-a-tions touch-ing Mo-by Dick which could not but oc-ca-sion-al-ly awak-en in any manâ s soul some alarm there was another thought or rather vague name-less hor-ror con-cern-ing him which at times by its in-ten-si-ty com-plete-ly over-pow-ered all the rest and yet so mys-ti-cal and well nigh in-ef-fa-ble was it that I al-most de-s-pair of put-ting it in a com-pre-hen-si-ble form It was the white-ness of the whale that above all things ap-palled me But how can I hope to ex-plain my-self here and yet in some dim ran-dom way ex-plain my-self I must else all th-ese chap-ters might be naught Though in many nat-u-ral ob-jec-ts white-ness refin-ing-ly en-hances beau-ty as if im-part-ing some spe-cial virtue of its own as in mar-bles japon-i-cas and pear-ls and though var-i-ous na-tions have in some way recog-nised a cer-tain roy-al preem-i-nence in this hue even the bar-bar-ic grand old kings of Pegu plac-ing the ti-tle â Lord of the White Ele-phantsâ above all their other mag-nil-o-quent ascrip-tions of do-min-ion and the modern kings of Si-am un-furl-ing the same snow white quadruped in the roy-al stan-dard and the Hanove-ri-an flag bear-ing the one fig-ure of a snow white charg-er and the great Aus-tri-an Em-pire CÃ sar-i-an heir to over-lord-ing Rome hav-ing for the im-pe-ri-al colour the same im-pe-ri-al hue and though this pre emi-nence in it ap-plies to the hu-man race it-self giv-ing the white man ideal master-ship over every dusky tribe and though be-sides all this white-ness has been even made sig-nif-i-cant of glad-ness for among the Ro-mans a white stone marked a joy-ful day and though in other mor-tal sym-pa-thies and sym-bol-iz-ings this same hue is made the em-blem of many touch-ing noble thingsâ the in-no-cence of brides the benig-ni-ty of age though among the Red Men of Amer-i-ca the giv-ing of the white belt of wam-pum was the deep-est pledge of honor though in many climes white-ness typ-i-fies the majesty of Jus-tice in the er-mine of the Judge and con-tributes to the dai-ly state of kings and queens drawn by milk white steeds though even in the higher mys-ter-ies of the most au-gust reli-gions it has been made the sym-bol of the divine spot-less-ness and pow-er by the Per-sian fire wor-ship-pers the white forked flame be-ing held the holi-est on the al-tar and in the Greek mytholo-gies Great Jove him-self be-ing made in-car-nate in a snow white bull and though to the noble Iro-quois the mid-win-ter sacri-fice of the sa-cred White Dog was by far the holi-est fes-ti-val of their the-ol-o-gy that spot-less faith-ful crea-ture be-ing held the purest en-voy they could send to the Great Spir-it with the an-nu-al tid-ings of their own fideli-ty and though direct-ly from the Latin word for white all Chris-tian pri-ests derive the name of one part of their sa-cred ves-ture the alb or tu-nic worn be-neath the cas-sock and though among the holy pom-ps of the Romish faith white is spe-cial-ly em-ployed in the cel-e-bra-tion of the Pas-sion of our Lord though in the Vi-sion of St John white robes are giv-en to the redeemed and the four and twen-ty elders stand clothed in white be-fore the great white throne and the Holy One that sit-teth there white like wool yet for all th-ese ac-cu-mu-lat-ed as-so-ci-a-tions with what-ev-er is sweet and honor-able and sublime there yet lurks an elu-sive some-thing in the in-ner-most idea of this hue which strikes more of pan-ic to the soul than that red-ness which af-frights in blood This elu-sive qual-i-ty it is which caus-es the thought of white-ness when divorced from more kind-ly as-so-ci-a-tions and cou-pled with any ob-ject ter-ri-ble in it-self to height-en that ter-ror to the fur-thest bounds Wit-ness the white bear of the poles and the white shark of the trop-ics what but their smooth flaky white-ness makes them the tran-scen-dent hor-rors they are That ghast-ly white-ness it is which im-parts such an ab-hor-rent mild-ness even more loath-some than ter-rif-ic to the dumb gloat-ing of their aspect So that not the fierce fanged tiger in his heraldic coat can so stag-ger courage as the white shroud-ed bear or shark With ref-er-ence to the Po-lar bear it may pos-si-bly be urged by him who would fain go still deep-er in-to this mat-ter that it is not the white-ness separate-ly re-gard-ed which height-ens the in-tol-er-a-ble hideous-ness of that brute for anal-ysed that height-ened hideous-ness it might be said on-ly ris-es from the cir-cum-stance that the ir-re-spon-si-ble fe-ro-cious-ness of the crea-ture stands in-vest-ed in the fleece of ce-les-tial in-no-cence and love and hence by bring-ing to-geth-er two such op-po-site emo-tions in our minds the Po-lar bear fright-ens us with so un-nat-u-ral a con-trast But even as-sum-ing all this to be true yet were it not for the white-ness you would not have that in-ten-si-fied ter-ror As for the white shark the white glid-ing ghost-li-ness of re-pose in that crea-ture when be-held in his or-di-nary moods strange-ly tal-lies with the same qual-i-ty in the Po-lar quadruped This pe-cu-liar-i-ty is most vivid-ly hit by the French in the name they bestow upon that fish The Romish mass for the dead be-gins with â Re-quiem eter-namâ eter-nal rest whence Re-quiem denom-i-nat-ing the mass it-self and any other funer-al mu-sic Now in al-lu-sion to the white si-lent still-ness of death in this shark and the mild dead-li-ness of his habits the French call him Re-quin Be-think thee of the al-ba-tross whence come those clouds of spir-i-tu-al won-der-ment and pale dread in which that white phan-tom sails in all imag-i-na-tions Not Co-leridge first threw that spell but Godâ s great un-flat-ter-ing lau-re-ate Na-ture I re-mem-ber the first al-ba-tross I ever saw It was dur-ing a pro-longed gale in waters hard upon the Antarc-tic seas From my forenoon watch below I as-cend-ed to the over-cloud-ed deck and there dashed upon the main hatch-es I saw a re-gal feath-ery thing of unspot-ted white-ness and with a hooked Ro-man bill sublime At in-ter-vals it arched forth its vast ar-changel wings as if to em-brace some holy ark Won-drous flut-ter-ings and throb-bings shook it Though bodi-ly un-harmed it ut-tered cries as some kingâ s ghost in su-per-nat-u-ral distress Through its in-ex-press-ible strange eyes methought I peeped to se-crets which took hold of God As Abra-ham be-fore the an-gels I bowed my-self the white thing was so white its wings so wide and in those for ever ex-iled waters I had lost the mis-er-able warp-ing me-mories of tra-di-tions and of towns Long I gazed at that prodi-gy of plumage I can-not tell can on-ly hint the things that dart-ed through me then But at last I awoke and turn-ing asked a sailor what bird was this A goney he replied Goney nev-er had heard that name be-fore is it con-ceiv-able that this glo-ri-ous thing is ut-ter-ly un-known to men ashore nev-er But some time after I learned that goney was some sea-manâ s name for al-ba-tross So that by no pos-si-bil-i-ty could Co-leridgeâ s wild Rhyme have had aught to do with those mys-ti-cal im-pres-sions which were mine when I saw that bird upon our deck For nei-ther had I then read the Rhyme nor knew the bird to be an al-ba-tross Yet in say-ing this I do but indi-rect-ly bur-nish a lit-tle brighter the noble mer-it of the poem and the poet I assert then that in the won-drous bodi-ly white-ness of the bird chiefly lurks the se-cret of the spell a truth the more evinced in this that by a sole-cism of ter-ms there are birds called grey al-ba-tross-es and th-ese I have fre-quent-ly seen but nev-er with such emo-tions as when I be-held the Antarc-tic fowl But how had the mys-tic thing been caught Whis-per it not and I will tell with a treach-er-ous hook and line as the fowl float-ed on the sea At last the Cap-tain made a post-man of it ty-ing a let-tered leath-ern tal-ly round its neck with the shipâ s time and place and then let-ting it es-cape But I doubt not that leath-ern tal-ly meant for man was tak-en off in Heav-en when the white fowl flew to join the wing fold-ing the in-vok-ing and ador-ing cheru-bim Most fa-mous in our Western an-nals and In-di-an tra-di-tions is that of the White Steed of the Prairies a mag-nif-i-cent milk white charg-er large eyed small head-ed bluff ch-est-ed and with the dig-ni-ty of a thou-sand monar-chs in his lofty over-scorn-ing car-riage He was the elect-ed Xerx-es of vast herds of wild hors-es whose pas-tures in those days were on-ly fenced by the Rocky Moun-tains and the Al-legha-nies At their flam-ing head he west-ward trooped it like that cho-sen star which every even-ing leads on the hosts of light The flash-ing cas-cade of his mane the curv-ing comet of his tail in-vest-ed him with hous-ings more re-s-plen-dent than gold and sil-ver beaters could have fur-nished him A most im-pe-ri-al and ar-changel-i-cal ap-pari-tion of that un-fall-en western world which to the eyes of the old trap-pers and hun-ters re-vived the glo-ries of those primeval times when Adam walked ma-jes-tic as a god bluff browed and fear-less as this mighty steed Whether march-ing amid his aides and mar-shals in the van of count-less co-horts that end-less-ly streamed it over the plains like an Ohio or whether with his cir-cum-am-bi-ent sub-jec-ts brows-ing all around at the hori-zon the White Steed gal-lop-ing-ly re-viewed them with warm nostrils red-den-ing through his cool milk-i-ness in what-ev-er aspect he pre-sent-ed him-self al-ways to the bravest In-di-ans he was the ob-ject of trem-bling rev-er-ence and awe Nor can it be ques-tioned from what stands on le-gendary record of this noble horse that it was his spir-i-tu-al white-ness chiefly which so clothed him with divine-ness and that this divine-ness had that in it which though com-mand-ing wor-ship at the same time en-forced a cer-tain name-less ter-ror But there are other in-stances where this white-ness los-es all that ac-ces-so-ry and strange glo-ry which in-vests it in the White Steed and Al-ba-tross What is it that in the Al-bi-no man so pe-cu-liar-ly re-pels and often shocks the eye as that some-times he is loathed by his own kith and kin It is that white-ness which in-vests him a thing ex-pressed by the name he bears The Al-bi-no is as well made as other menâ has no sub-stan-tive de-for-mi-tyâ and yet this mere aspect of all per-vad-ing white-ness makes him more strange-ly hideous than the ugli-est abor-tion Why should this be so Nor in quite other aspec-ts does Na-ture in her least pal-pa-ble but not the less ma-li-cious agen-cies fail to en-list among her forces this crown-ing at-tribute of the ter-ri-ble From its snowy aspect the gauntlet-ed ghost of the South-ern Seas has been denom-i-nat-ed the White Squall Nor in some his-toric in-stances has the art of hu-man mal-ice omit-ted so po-tent an aux-il-iary How wild-ly it height-ens the ef-fect of that pas-sage in Frois-sart when masked in the snowy sym-bol of their fac-tion the des-per-ate White Hoods of Ghent mur-der their bailiff in the mar-ket place Nor in some things does the com-mon hered-i-tary ex-pe-ri-ence of all mankind fail to bear wit-ness to the su-per-nat-u-ral-ism of this hue It can-not well be doubt-ed that the one vis-i-ble qual-i-ty in the aspect of the dead which most ap-pals the gaz-er is the mar-ble pal-lor lin-ger-ing there as if in-deed that pal-lor were as much like the badge of con-ster-na-tion in the other world as of mor-tal trep-i-da-tion here And from that pal-lor of the dead we bor-row the ex-pres-sive hue of the shroud in which we wrap them Nor even in our su-per-sti-tions do we fail to throw the same snowy man-tle round our phan-toms all ghosts ris-ing in a milk white fogâ Yea while th-ese ter-rors seize us let us add that even the king of ter-rors when per-son-i-fied by the evan-ge-list rides on his pal-lid horse There-fore in his other moods sym-bol-ize what-ev-er grand or gra-cious thing he will by white-ness no man can de-ny that in its pro-found-est ideal-ized sig-nif-i-cance it cal-ls up a pe-cu-liar ap-pari-tion to the soul But though without dis-sent this point be fixed how is mor-tal man to ac-count for it To anal-yse it would seem im-pos-si-ble Can we then by the ci-ta-tion of some of those in-stances where-in this thing of white-nessâ though for the time either whol-ly or in great part stripped of all direct as-so-ci-a-tions cal-cu-lat-ed to im-part to it aught fear-ful but nev-er-the-less is found to ex-ert over us the same sorcery how-ev-er mod-i-fied â can we thus hope to light upon some chance clue to con-duct us to the hid-den cause we seek Let us try But in a mat-ter like this subtle-ty ap-peals to subtle-ty and without imag-i-na-tion no man can fol-low another in-to th-ese hal-ls And though doubt-less some at least of the imag-i-na-tive im-pres-sions about to be pre-sent-ed may have been shared by most men yet few per-haps were en-tire-ly con-scious of them at the time and there-fore may not be able to re-call them now Why to the man of un-tu-tored ideal-i-ty who hap-pens to be but loose-ly ac-quaint-ed with the pe-cu-liar char-ac-ter of the day does the bare men-tion of Whit-sun-tide mar-shal in the fan-cy such long dreary speech-less pro-ces-sions of slow pac-ing pil-grims down cast and hood-ed with new fallen snow Or to the un-read un-so-phis-ti-cat-ed Protes-tant of the Mid-dle Amer-i-can States why does the pass-ing men-tion of a White Fri-ar or a White Nun evoke such an eye-less stat-ue in the soul Or what is there apart from the tra-di-tions of dun-geoned war-riors and kings which will not whol-ly ac-count for it that makes the White Tow-er of Lon-don tell so much more strong-ly on the imag-i-na-tion of an un-trav-elled Amer-i-can than those other sto-ried struc-tures its neigh-borsâ the By-ward Tow-er or even the Bloody And those sublimer tow-ers the White Moun-tains of New Hamp-shire whence in pe-cu-liar moods comes that gi-gan-tic ghost-li-ness over the soul at the bare men-tion of that name while the thought of Vir-gini-aâ s Blue Ridge is full of a soft dewy dis-tant dreami-ness Or why ir-re-spec-tive of all lat-i-tudes and lon-gi-tudes does the name of the White Sea ex-ert such a spec-tral-ness over the fan-cy while that of the Yel-low Sea lul-ls us with mor-tal thoughts of long lac-quered mild after-noons on the waves fol-lowed by the gaud-i-est and yet sleepi-est of sun-sets Or to choose a whol-ly un-sub-stan-tial in-stance pure-ly ad-dressed to the fan-cy why in read-ing the old fairy tales of Cen-tral Europe does â the tall pale manâ of the Hartz forests whose change-less pal-lor un-rustling-ly glides through the green of the grovesâ why is this phan-tom more ter-ri-ble than all the whoop-ing im-ps of the Blocks-burg Nor is it al-to-geth-er the re-mem-brance of her cathe-dral top-pling earthquakes nor the stampe-does of her fran-tic seas nor the tear-less-ness of arid skies that nev-er rain nor the sight of her wide field of lean-ing spires wrenched cope stones and cross-es all adroop like cant-ed yards of an-chored fleets and her subur-ban av-enues of house wal-ls ly-ing over upon each other as a tossed pack of cards â it is not th-ese things alone which make tear-less Li-ma the strangest sad-dest ci-ty thou canâ st see For Li-ma has tak-en the white veil and there is a higher hor-ror in this white-ness of her woe Old as Pizarro this white-ness keeps her ruins for ever new ad-mits not the cheer-ful green-ness of com-plete de-cay spreads over her bro-ken ram-parts the rigid pal-lor of an apoplexy that fix-es its own dis-tor-tions I know that to the com-mon ap-pre-hen-sion this phenomenon of white-ness is not con-fessed to be the prime agent in ex-ag-ger-at-ing the ter-ror of ob-jec-ts other-wise ter-ri-ble nor to the un-imag-i-na-tive mind is there aught of ter-ror in those ap-pear-ances whose aw-ful-ness to another mind al-most sole-ly con-sists in this one phenomenon espe-cial-ly when ex-hib-it-ed un-der any form at all ap-proach-ing to mute-ness or univer-sal-i-ty What I mean by th-ese two state-men-ts may per-haps be re-spec-tive-ly elu-ci-dat-ed by the fol-low-ing ex-am-ples First The mariner when draw-ing nigh the coasts of for-eign lands if by night he hear the roar of break-ers starts to vig-i-lance and feels just enough of trep-i-da-tion to sharp-en all his fac-ul-ties but un-der pre-cise-ly sim-i-lar cir-cum-stances let him be called from his ham-mock to view his ship sail-ing through a mid-night sea of milky white-nessâ as if from en-cir-cling head-lands shoals of combed white bears were swim-ming round him then he feels a si-lent su-per-sti-tious dread the shroud-ed phan-tom of the whitened waters is hor-ri-ble to him as a real ghost in vain the lead as-sures him he is still off sound-ings heart and helm they both go down he nev-er rests till blue water is un-der him again Yet where is the mariner who will tell thee â Sir it was not so much the fear of strik-ing hid-den rocks as the fear of that hideous white-ness that so stirred me â Se-cond To the na-tive In-di-an of Peru the con-tin-u-al sight of the snow how-da-hed An-des con-veys naught of dread ex-cept per-haps in the mere fan-cy-ing of the eter-nal frost-ed deso-late-ness reign-ing at such vast alti-tudes and the nat-u-ral con-ceit of what a fear-ful-ness it would be to lose one-self in such in-hu-man soli-tudes Much the same is it with the back-woods-man of the West who with com-par-a-tive in-dif-fer-ence views an un-bound-ed prair-ie sheet-ed with driv-en snow no shad-ow of tree or twig to break the fixed trance of white-ness Not so the sailor be-hold-ing the scenery of the Antarc-tic seas where at times by some in-fer-nal trick of legerde-main in the pow-ers of frost and air he shiver-ing and half ship-wrecked in-stead of rain-bows speak-ing hope and so-lace to his mis-ery views what seems a bound-less church-yard grin-ning upon him with its lean ice mon-u-men-ts and splin-tered cross-es But thou sayest me-thinks that white lead chap-ter about white-ness is but a white flag hung out from a craven soul thou sur-ren-der-est to a hy-po Ish-mael Tell me why this strong young colt foaled in some peace-ful val-ley of Ver-mont far re-moved from all beasts of preyâ why is it that upon the sun-ni-est day if you but shake a fresh buf-fa-lo robe be-hind him so that he can-not even see it but on-ly smel-ls its wild an-i-mal musk-i-nessâ why will he start snort and with burst-ing eyes paw the ground in phren-sies of af-fright There is no re-mem-brance in him of any gor-ings of wild crea-tures in his green north-ern home so that the strange musk-i-ness he smel-ls can-not re-call to him any-thing as-so-ci-at-ed with the ex-pe-ri-ence of former per-ils for what knows he this New Eng-land colt of the black bisons of dis-tant Ore-gon No but here thou be-hold-est even in a dumb brute the in-stinct of the knowl-edge of the de-monism in the world Though thou-sands of miles from Ore-gon still when he smel-ls that sav-age musk the rend-ing gor-ing bi-son herds are as pre-sent as to the de-sert-ed wild foal of the prairies which this in-stant they may be tram-pling in-to dust Thus then the muf-fled rollings of a milky sea the bleak rustlings of the festooned frosts of moun-tains the deso-late shift-ings of the windrowed snows of prairies all th-ese to Ish-mael are as the shak-ing of that buf-fa-lo robe to the fright-ened colt Though nei-ther knows where lie the name-less things of which the mys-tic sign gives forth such hin-ts yet with me as with the colt some-where those things must ex-ist Though in many of its aspec-ts this vis-i-ble world seems formed in love the in-vis-i-ble spheres were formed in fright But not yet have we solved the in-can-ta-tion of this white-ness and learned why it ap-peals with such pow-er to the soul and more strange and far more por-ten-tousâ why as we have seen it is at once the most mean-ing sym-bol of spir-i-tu-al things nay the very veil of the Chris-tianâ s De-ity and yet should be as it is the in-ten-si-fy-ing agent in things the most ap-palling to mankind Is it that by its in-def-i-nite-ness it shad-ows forth the heart-less voids and im-men-si-ties of the uni-verse and thus stabs us from be-hind with the thought of an-ni-hi-la-tion when be-hold-ing the white depths of the milky way Or is it that as in essence white-ness is not so much a colour as the vis-i-ble ab-sence of colour and at the same time the con-crete of all colours is it for th-ese rea-sons that there is such a dumb blank-ness full of mean-ing in a wide land-scape of snowsâ a colour-less all colour of athe-ism from which we shrink And when we con-sid-er that other the-o-ry of the nat-u-ral philoso-phers that all other earth-ly huesâ every state-ly or love-ly em-bla-zon-ingâ the sweet tinges of sun-set skies and woods yea and the gild-ed vel-vets of but-ter-flies and the but-ter-fly cheeks of young gir-ls all th-ese are but subtile de-ceits not ac-tu-al-ly in-her-ent in sub-stances but on-ly laid on from without so that all dei-fied Na-ture ab-so-lute-ly pain-ts like the har-lot whose al-lure-men-ts cover noth-ing but the char-nel house within and when we pro-ceed fur-ther and con-sid-er that the mys-ti-cal cos-met-ic which pro-duces every one of her hues the great prin-ci-ple of light for ever re-mains white or color-less in it-self and if oper-at-ing without medi-um upon mat-ter would touch all ob-jec-ts even tulips and ros-es with its own blank tingeâ pon-der-ing all this the palsied uni-verse lies be-fore us a leper and like wil-ful trav-ellers in La-p-land who refuse to wear coloured and colour-ing glass-es upon their eyes so the wretched in-fi-del gazes him-self blind at the mon-u-men-tal white shroud that wraps all the prospect around him And of all th-ese things the Al-bi-no whale was the sym-bol Won-der ye then at the fiery hunt CHAPTER 43 Hark â HIST Did you hear that noise Caba-co â It was the mid-dle watch a fair moon-light the sea-men were stand-ing in a cor-don ex-tend-ing from one of the fresh water but-ts in the waist to the scut-tle butt near the taf-frail In this man-ner they passed the buck-ets to fill the scut-tle butt Stand-ing for the most part on the hal-lowed precinc-ts of the quar-ter deck they were care-ful not to speak or rus-tle their feet From hand to hand the buck-ets went in the deep-est si-lence on-ly bro-ken by the oc-ca-sion-al flap of a sail and the steady hum of the unceas-ing-ly ad-vanc-ing keel It was in the midst of this re-pose that Archy one of the cor-don whose post was near the after hatch-es whis-pered to his neigh-bor a Cho-lo the words above â Hist did you hear that noise Caba-co â â Take the buck-et will ye Archy what noise dâ ye mean â â There it is againâ un-der the hatch-esâ donâ t you hear itâ a coughâ it sound-ed like a cough â â Cough be damned Pass along that re-turn buck-et â â There againâ there it is â it sounds like two or three sleep-ers turn-ing over now â â Caram-ba have done ship-mate will ye Itâ s the three soaked bis-cuits ye eat for sup-per turn-ing over in-side of yeâ noth-ing else Look to the buck-et â â Say what ye will ship-mate Iâ ve sharp ears â â Aye you are the chap ainâ t ye that heard the hum of the old Quak-er-essâ s knit-ting nee-dles fifty miles at sea from Nan-tuck-et youâ re the chap â â Grin away weâ ll see what turns up Hark ye Caba-co there is some-body down in the after hold that has not yet been seen on deck and I sus-pect our old Mogul knows some-thing of it too I heard Stubb tell Flask one morn-ing watch that there was some-thing of that sort in the wind â â Tish the buck-et â CHAPTER 44 The Chart Had you fol-lowed Cap-tain Ahab down in-to his cabin after the squall that took place on the night suc-ceed-ing that wild rat-i-fi-ca-tion of his pur-pose with his crew you would have seen him go to a lock-er in the tran-som and bring-ing out a large wrin-kled roll of yel-low-ish sea charts spread them be-fore him on his screwed down table Then seat-ing him-self be-fore it you would have seen him in-tent-ly study the var-i-ous lines and shad-ings which there met his eye and with slow but steady pen-cil trace ad-di-tion-al cours-es over spaces that be-fore were blank At in-ter-vals he would re-fer to piles of old log books be-side him where-in were set down the sea-sons and places in which on var-i-ous former voy-ages of var-i-ous ships sperm whales had been cap-tured or seen While thus em-ployed the heavy pewter lamp sus-pend-ed in chains over his head con-tin-u-al-ly rocked with the mo-tion of the ship and for ever threw shift-ing gleams and shad-ows of lines upon his wrin-kled brow till it al-most seemed that while he him-self was mark-ing out lines and cours-es on the wrin-kled charts some in-vis-i-ble pen-cil was al-so trac-ing lines and cours-es upon the deeply marked chart of his fore-head But it was not this night in par-tic-u-lar that in the soli-tude of his cabin Ahab thus pon-dered over his charts Al-most every night they were brought out al-most every night some pen-cil marks were ef-faced and others were sub-sti-tut-ed For with the charts of all four oceans be-fore him Ahab was thread-ing a maze of cur-ren-ts and ed-dies with a view to the more cer-tain ac-com-plish-ment of that mono-ma-ni-ac thought of his soul Now to any one not ful-ly ac-quaint-ed with the ways of the le-viathans it might seem an ab-surd-ly hope-less task thus to seek out one soli-tary crea-ture in the un-hooped oceans of this plan-et But not so did it seem to Ahab who knew the sets of all tides and cur-ren-ts and there-by cal-cu-lat-ing the drift-ings of the sperm whaleâ s food and al-so calling to mind the reg-u-lar ascer-tained sea-sons for hunt-ing him in par-tic-u-lar lat-i-tudes could ar-rive at rea-son-able sur-mis-es al-most ap-proach-ing to cer-tain-ties con-cern-ing the timeli-est day to be upon this or that ground in search of his prey So as-sured in-deed is the fact con-cern-ing the pe-ri-od-i-cal-ness of the sperm whaleâ s re-sort-ing to giv-en waters that many hun-ters believe that could he be close-ly ob-served and stud-ied through-out the world were the logs for one voy-age of the en-tire whale fleet care-ful-ly col-lat-ed then the mi-gra-tions of the sperm whale would be found to cor-re-spond in in-vari-abil-i-ty to those of the her-ring shoals or the flights of swal-lows On this hint at-temp-ts have been made to con-struct elab-o-rate mi-gra-to-ry charts of the sperm whale Since the above was writ-ten the state-ment is hap-pi-ly borne out by an of-fi-cial cir-cu-lar is-sued by Lieu-tenant Mau-ry of the Na-tion-al Ob-ser-va-to-ry Wash-ing-ton April 16th 1851 By that cir-cu-lar it ap-pears that pre-cise-ly such a chart is in course of com-ple-tion and por-tions of it are pre-sent-ed in the cir-cu-lar â This chart di-vides the ocean in-to distric-ts of five de-grees of lat-i-tude by five de-grees of lon-gi-tude per-pen-dic-u-lar-ly through each of which distric-ts are twelve colum-ns for the twelve months and hor-i-zon-tal-ly through each of which distric-ts are three lines one to show the num-ber of days that have been spent in each month in every district and the two others to show the num-ber of days in which whales sperm or right have been seen â Be-sides when mak-ing a pas-sage from one feed-ing ground to another the sperm whales guid-ed by some in-fal-li-ble in-stinc-tâ say rather se-cret in-tel-li-gence from the De-ityâ most-ly swim in veins as they are called con-tin-u-ing their way along a giv-en ocean line with such un-de-vi-at-ing ex-ac-ti-tude that no ship ever sailed her course by any chart with one tithe of such marvel-lous pre-ci-sion Though in th-ese cas-es the direc-tion tak-en by any one whale be straight as a sur-vey-orâ s par-al-lel and though the line of ad-vance be strict-ly con-fined to its own unavoid-able straight wake yet the ar-bi-trary vein in which at th-ese times he is said to swim gen-er-al-ly em-braces some few miles in width more or less as the vein is pre-sumed to ex-pand or con-tract but nev-er ex-ceeds the visu-al sweep from the whale shipâ s mast heads when cir-cum-spect-ly glid-ing along this mag-ic zone The sum is that at par-tic-u-lar sea-sons within that breadth and along that path mi-grat-ing whales may with great con-fi-dence be looked for And hence not on-ly at sub-stan-ti-at-ed times upon well known separate feed-ing grounds could Ahab hope to en-counter his prey but in cross-ing the widest ex-pans-es of water between those grounds he could by his art so place and time him-self on his way as even then not to be whol-ly without prospect of a meet-ing There was a cir-cum-stance which at first sight seemed to en-tan-gle his deliri-ous but still me-thod-i-cal scheme But not so in the real-i-ty per-haps Though the gre-gar-i-ous sperm whales have their reg-u-lar sea-sons for par-tic-u-lar grounds yet in gen-er-al you can-not con-clude that the herds which haunt-ed such and such a lat-i-tude or lon-gi-tude this year say will turn out to be iden-ti-cal-ly the same with those that were found there the pre-ced-ing sea-son though there are pe-cu-liar and un-ques-tion-able in-stances where the con-trary of this has proved true In gen-er-al the same re-mark on-ly within a less wide lim-it ap-plies to the soli-taries and her-mits among the ma-tured aged sperm whales So that though Mo-by Dick had in a former year been seen for ex-am-ple on what is called the Sey-chelle ground in the In-di-an ocean or Vol-cano Bay on the Ja-panese Coast yet it did not fol-low that were the Pe-quod to visit either of those spots at any sub-se-quent cor-re-spond-ing sea-son she would in-fal-li-bly en-counter him there So too with some other feed-ing grounds where he had at times re-vealed him-self But all th-ese seemed on-ly his ca-su-al stop-ping places and ocean in-ns so to speak not his places of pro-longed abode And where Ahabâ s chances of ac-com-plish-ing his ob-ject have hither-to been spo-ken of al-lu-sion has on-ly been made to what-ev-er way side an-tecedent ex-tra prospec-ts were his ere a par-tic-u-lar set time or place were at-tained when all pos-si-bil-i-ties would be-come prob-a-bil-i-ties and as Ahab fond-ly thought every pos-si-bil-i-ty the next thing to a cer-tain-ty That par-tic-u-lar set time and place were con-joined in the one tech-ni-cal phraseâ the Sea-son on the Line For there and then for sev-er-al con-sec-u-tive years Mo-by Dick had been pe-ri-od-i-cal-ly de-scried lin-ger-ing in those waters for awhile as the sun in its an-nu-al round loi-ters for a pre-dict-ed in-ter-val in any one sign of the Zo-di-ac There it was too that most of the dead-ly en-coun-ters with the white whale had tak-en place there the waves were sto-ried with his deeds there al-so was that trag-ic spot where the mono-ma-ni-ac old man had found the aw-ful mo-tive to his vengeance But in the cau-tious com-pre-hen-sive-ness and un-loi-ter-ing vig-i-lance with which Ahab threw his brood-ing soul in-to this un-fal-ter-ing hunt he would not per-mit him-self to rest all his hopes upon the one crown-ing fact above men-tioned how-ev-er flat-ter-ing it might be to those hopes nor in the sleep-less-ness of his vow could he so tran-quil-lize his un-qui-et heart as to post-pone all in-ter-ven-ing quest Now the Pe-quod had sailed from Nan-tuck-et at the very begin-ning of the Sea-son on the Line No pos-si-ble en-deav-or then could en-able her com-man-der to make the great pas-sage south-wards dou-ble Cape Horn and then run-ning down six-ty de-grees of lat-i-tude ar-rive in the equa-to-ri-al Pa-cif-ic in time to cruise there There-fore he must wait for the next en-su-ing sea-son Yet the pre-ma-ture hour of the Pe-quodâ s sail-ing had per-haps been cor-rect-ly select-ed by Ahab with a view to this very com-plex-ion of things Be-cause an in-ter-val of three hun-dred and six-ty five days and nights was be-fore him an in-ter-val which in-stead of im-pa-tient-ly en-dur-ing ashore he would spend in a mis-cel-la-neous hunt if by chance the White Whale spend-ing his va-ca-tion in seas far re-mote from his pe-ri-od-i-cal feed-ing grounds should turn up his wrin-kled brow off the Per-sian Gulf or in the Ben-gal Bay or Chi-na Seas or in any other waters haunt-ed by his race So that Mon-soons Pam-pas Norâ Westers Har-mat-tans Trades any wind but the Le-van-ter and Si-moon might blow Mo-by Dick in-to the de-vi-ous zig zag world cir-cle of the Pe-quodâ s cir-cum-nav-i-gat-ing wake But grant-ing all this yet re-gard-ed dis-creet-ly and cool-ly seems it not but a mad idea this that in the broad bound-less ocean one soli-tary whale even if en-coun-tered should be thought ca-pable of in-di-vid-u-al recog-ni-tion from his hunter even as a white beard-ed Mufti in the thronged thor-ough-fares of Con-stantino-ple Yes For the pe-cu-liar snow white brow of Mo-by Dick and his snow white hump could not but be un-mis-tak-able And have I not tal-lied the whale Ahab would mut-ter to him-self as after por-ing over his charts till long after mid-night he would throw him-self back in rev-er-iesâ tal-lied him and shall he es-cape His broad fins are bored and scal-loped out like a lost sheepâ s ear And here his mad mind would run on in a breath-less race till a weari-ness and faint-ness of pon-der-ing came over him and in the open air of the deck he would seek to re-cov-er his strength Ah God what trances of tor-men-ts does that man en-dure who is con-sumed with one unachieved re-venge-ful de-sire He sleeps with clenched hands and wakes with his own bloody nails in his palms Often when forced from his ham-mock by ex-haust-ing and in-tol-er-a-bly vivid dreams of the night which re-sum-ing his own in-tense thoughts through the day car-ried them on amid a clash-ing of phren-sies and whirled them round and round and round in his blaz-ing brain till the very throb-bing of his life spot be-came in-suf-fer-able an-guish and when as was some-times the case th-ese spir-i-tu-al throes in him heaved his be-ing up from its base and a chasm seemed open-ing in him from which forked flames and light-nings shot up and ac-cursed fiends beck-oned him to leap down among them when this hell in him-self yawned be-neath him a wild cry would be heard through the ship and with glar-ing eyes Ahab would burst from his state room as though es-cap-ing from a bed that was on fire Yet th-ese per-haps in-stead of be-ing the un-sup-press-able symp-toms of some la-tent weak-ness or fright at his own re-solve were but the plainest to-kens of its in-ten-si-ty For at such times crazy Ahab the schem-ing unap-peas-ed-ly stead-fast hunter of the white whale this Ahab that had gone to his ham-mock was not the agent that so caused him to burst from it in hor-ror again The lat-ter was the eter-nal liv-ing prin-ci-ple or soul in him and in sleep be-ing for the time dis-so-ci-at-ed from the char-ac-ter-iz-ing mind which at other times em-ployed it for its outer ve-hi-cle or agent it spon-ta-neous-ly sought es-cape from the scorch-ing con-ti-gu-i-ty of the fran-tic thing of which for the time it was no longer an in-te-gral But as the mind does not ex-ist un-less leagued with the soul there-fore it must have been that in Ahabâ s case yield-ing up all his thoughts and fan-cies to his one supreme pur-pose that pur-pose by its own sheer in-vet-er-a-cy of will forced it-self against gods and devils in-to a kind of self as-sumed in-de-pen-dent be-ing of its own Nay could grim-ly live and burn while the com-mon vi-tal-i-ty to which it was con-joined fled hor-ror strick-en from the un-bid-den and un-fa-thered birth There-fore the tor-ment-ed spir-it that glared out of bodi-ly eyes when what seemed Ahab rushed from his room was for the time but a va-cat-ed thing a form-less som-nam-bu-lis-tic be-ing a ray of liv-ing light to be sure but without an ob-ject to colour and there-fore a blank-ness in it-self God help thee old man thy thoughts have creat-ed a crea-ture in thee and he whose in-tense think-ing thus makes him a Prometheus a vul-ture feeds upon that heart for ever that vul-ture the very crea-ture he creates CHAPTER 45 The Af-fi-davit So far as what there may be of a nar-ra-tive in this book and in-deed as indi-rect-ly touch-ing one or two very in-ter-est-ing and cu-ri-ous par-tic-u-lars in the habits of sperm whales the fore-go-ing chap-ter in its ear-li-er part is as im-por-tant a one as will be found in this vol-ume but the lead-ing mat-ter of it re-quires to be still fur-ther and more fa-mil-iar-ly en-larged upon in order to be ad-e-quate-ly un-der-stood and more-over to take away any in-creduli-ty which a pro-found ig-no-rance of the en-tire sub-ject may in-duce in some minds as to the nat-u-ral ver-i-ty of the main poin-ts of this af-fair I care not to per-form this part of my task me-thod-i-cal-ly but shall be con-tent to pro-duce the de-sired im-pres-sion by separate ci-ta-tions of items prac-ti-cal-ly or reli-ably known to me as a whale-man and from th-ese ci-ta-tions I take itâ the con-clu-sion aimed at will nat-u-ral-ly fol-low of it-self First I have per-son-al-ly known three in-stances where a whale after re-ceiv-ing a har-poon has ef-fect-ed a com-plete es-cape and after an in-ter-val in one in-stance of three years has been again struck by the same hand and slain when the two irons both marked by the same pri-vate cypher have been tak-en from the body In the in-stance where three years in-ter-vened between the fling-ing of the two har-poons and I think it may have been some-thing more than that the man who dart-ed them hap-pen-ing in the in-ter-val to go in a trad-ing ship on a voy-age to Africa went ashore there joined a dis-cov-ery par-ty and pen-e-trat-ed far in-to the in-te-ri-or where he trav-elled for a pe-ri-od of near-ly two years often en-dan-gered by ser-pen-ts sav-ages tigers poi-sonous mi-as-mas with all the other com-mon per-ils in-ci-dent to wan-der-ing in the heart of un-known re-gions Mean-while the whale he had struck must al-so have been on its trav-els no doubt it had thrice cir-cum-nav-i-gat-ed the globe brush-ing with its flanks all the coasts of Africa but to no pur-pose This man and this whale again came to-geth-er and the one van-quished the other I say I my-self have known three in-stances sim-i-lar to this that is in two of them I saw the whales struck and upon the se-cond at-tack saw the two irons with the re-spec-tive marks cut in them after-wards tak-en from the dead fish In the three year in-stance it so fell out that I was in the boat both times first and last and the last time distinct-ly recog-nised a pe-cu-liar sort of huge mole un-der the whaleâ s eye which I had ob-served there three years pre-vi-ous I say three years but I am pret-ty sure it was more than that Here are three in-stances then which I per-son-al-ly know the truth of but I have heard of many other in-stances from per-sons whose verac-i-ty in the mat-ter there is no good ground to im-peach Se-cond-ly It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fish-ery how-ev-er ig-no-rant the world ashore may be of it that there have been sev-er-al me-morable his-tor-i-cal in-stances where a par-tic-u-lar whale in the ocean has been at dis-tant times and places pop-u-lar-ly cog-nis-able Why such a whale be-came thus marked was not al-to-geth-er and orig-i-nal-ly owing to his bodi-ly pe-cu-liar-i-ties as distin-guished from other whales for how-ev-er pe-cu-liar in that re-spect any chance whale may be they soon put an end to his pe-cu-liar-i-ties by killing him and boil-ing him down in-to a pe-cu-liar-ly valu-able oil No the rea-son was this that from the fatal ex-pe-ri-ences of the fish-ery there hung a ter-ri-ble pres-tige of per-ilous-ness about such a whale as there did about Ri-nal-do Ri-nal-di-ni in-so-much that most fish-er-men were con-tent to recog-nise him by mere-ly touch-ing their tarpaulins when he would be dis-cov-ered loung-ing by them on the sea without seek-ing to cul-ti-vate a more in-ti-mate ac-quain-tance Like some poor devils ashore that hap-pen to know an iras-ci-ble great man they make dis-tant unob-tru-sive sa-lu-ta-tions to him in the street lest if they pur-sued the ac-quain-tance fur-ther they might re-ceive a sum-ma-ry thump for their pre-sump-tion But not on-ly did each of th-ese fa-mous whales en-joy great in-di-vid-u-al celebri-tyâ Nay you may call it an ocean wide renown not on-ly was he fa-mous in life and now is im-mor-tal in fore-cas-tle sto-ries after death but he was ad-mit-ted in-to all the rights priv-i-leges and distinc-tions of a name had as much a name in-deed as Cam-by-ses or CÃ sar Was it not so O Ti-mor Tom thou famed le-viathan scarred like an ice-berg who so long didâ st lurk in the Ori-en-tal straits of that name whose spout was oft seen from the palmy beach of Om-bay Was it not so O New Zealand Jack thou ter-ror of all cruis-ers that crossed their wakes in the vicin-i-ty of the Tat-too Land Was it not so O Morquan King of Ja-pan whose lofty jet they say at times as-sumed the sem-blance of a snow white cross against the sky Was it not so O Don Miguel thou Chil-ian whale marked like an old tor-toise with mys-tic hiero-glyph-ics upon the back In plain prose here are four whales as well known to the stu-den-ts of Ce-tacean His-to-ry as Mar-ius or Syl-la to the clas-sic schol-ar But this is not all New Zealand Tom and Don Miguel after at var-i-ous times creat-ing great hav-oc among the boats of dif-fer-ent ves-sels were fi-nal-ly gone in quest of sys-tem-at-i-cal-ly hunt-ed out chased and killed by valiant whal-ing cap-tains who heaved up their an-chors with that ex-press ob-ject as much in view as in set-ting out through the Nar-ra-gansett Woods Cap-tain But-ler of old had it in his mind to cap-ture that no-to-ri-ous mur-der-ous sav-age An-na-won the head-most war-rior of the In-di-an King Philip I do not know where I can find a bet-ter place than just here to make men-tion of one or two other things which to me seem im-por-tant as in print-ed form estab-lish-ing in all re-spec-ts the rea-son-able-ness of the whole sto-ry of the White Whale more espe-cial-ly the catas-tro-phe For this is one of those dis-heart-en-ing in-stances where truth re-quires full as much bol-ster-ing as er-ror So ig-no-rant are most lands-men of some of the plainest and most pal-pa-ble won-ders of the world that without some hin-ts touch-ing the plain fac-ts his-tor-i-cal and other-wise of the fish-ery they might scout at Mo-by Dick as a mon-strous fable or still worse and more detestable a hideous and in-tol-er-a-ble al-le-go-ry First Though most men have some vague flit-ting ideas of the gen-er-al per-ils of the grand fish-ery yet they have noth-ing like a fixed vivid con-cep-tion of those per-ils and the fre-quen-cy with which they re-cur One rea-son per-haps is that not one in fifty of the ac-tu-al disas-ters and deaths by ca-su-al-ties in the fish-ery ever finds a public record at home how-ev-er tran-sient and im-me-di-ate-ly for-got-ten that record Do you sup-pose that that poor fel-low there who this mo-ment per-haps caught by the whale line off the coast of New Guinea is be-ing car-ried down to the bot-tom of the sea by the sound-ing le-viathanâ do you sup-pose that that poor fel-lowâ s name will ap-pear in the news-pa-per obit-u-ary you will read to mor-row at your break-fast No be-cause the mails are very ir-reg-u-lar between here and New Guinea In fact did you ever hear what might be called reg-u-lar news direct or indi-rect from New Guinea Yet I tell you that upon one par-tic-u-lar voy-age which I made to the Pa-cif-ic among many others we spoke thir-ty dif-fer-ent ships every one of which had had a death by a whale some of them more than one and three that had each lost a boatâ s crew For Godâ s sake be eco-nom-i-cal with your lam-ps and can-dles not a gal-lon you burn but at least one drop of manâ s blood was spilled for it Se-cond-ly Peo-ple ashore have in-deed some in-def-i-nite idea that a whale is an enor-mous crea-ture of enor-mous pow-er but I have ever found that when nar-rat-ing to them some spe-cif-ic ex-am-ple of this two fold enor-mous-ness they have sig-nif-i-cant-ly com-pli-ment-ed me upon my face-tious-ness when I de-clare upon my soul I had no more idea of be-ing face-tious than Mos-es when he wrote the his-to-ry of the plagues of Egypt But for-tu-nate-ly the spe-cial point I here seek can be estab-lished upon tes-ti-mo-ny en-tire-ly in-de-pen-dent of my own That point is this The Sperm Whale is in some cas-es suf-fi-cient-ly pow-er-ful know-ing and ju-di-cious-ly ma-li-cious as with direct afore-thought to stave in ut-ter-ly de-stroy and sink a large ship and what is more the Sperm Whale has done it First In the year 182 the ship Es-sex Cap-tain Pol-lard of Nan-tuck-et was cruis-ing in the Pa-cif-ic Ocean One day she saw spouts low-ered her boats and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales Ere long sev-er-al of the whales were wound-ed when sud-den-ly a very large whale es-cap-ing from the boats is-sued from the shoal and bore direct-ly down upon the ship Dash-ing his fore-head against her hull he so stove her in that in less than â ten min-utesâ she set-tled down and fell over Not a sur-viv-ing plank of her has been seen since After the sever-est ex-po-sure part of the crew reached the land in their boats Be-ing re-turned home at last Cap-tain Pol-lard once more sailed for the Pa-cif-ic in com-mand of another ship but the gods ship-wrecked him again upon un-known rocks and break-ers for the se-cond time his ship was ut-ter-ly lost and forth-with for-swear-ing the sea he has nev-er tempt-ed it since At this day Cap-tain Pol-lard is a res-i-dent of Nan-tuck-et I have seen Owen Chace who was chief mate of the Es-sex at the time of the tragedy I have read his plain and faith-ful nar-ra-tive I have con-versed with his son and all this within a few miles of the scene of the catas-tro-phe The fol-low-ing are ex-trac-ts from Chaceâ s nar-ra-tive â Every fact seemed to war-rant me in con-clud-ing that it was any-thing but chance which direct-ed his oper-a-tions he made two sev-er-al at-tacks upon the ship at a short in-ter-val between them both of which ac-cord-ing to their direc-tion were cal-cu-lat-ed to do us the most in-jury by be-ing made ahead and there-by com-bin-ing the speed of the two ob-jec-ts for the shock to ef-fect which the ex-act manÅ uvres which he made were ne-c-es-sary His aspect was most hor-ri-ble and such as indi-cat-ed re-sent-ment and fury He came direct-ly from the shoal which we had just be-fore en-tered and in which we had struck three of his com-pan-ions as if fired with re-venge for their suf-fer-ings â Again â At all even-ts the whole cir-cum-stances tak-en to-geth-er all hap-pen-ing be-fore my own eyes and pro-duc-ing at the time im-pres-sions in my mind of de-cid-ed cal-cu-lat-ing mis-chief on the part of the whale many of which im-pres-sions I can-not now re-call in-duce me to be sat-is-fied that I am cor-rect in my opin-ion â Here are his re-flec-tions some time after quit-ting the ship dur-ing a black night in an open boat when al-most de-s-pair-ing of reach-ing any hospitable shore â The dark ocean and swelling waters were noth-ing the fears of be-ing swal-lowed up by some dread-ful tem-pest or dashed upon hid-den rocks with all the other or-di-nary sub-jec-ts of fear-ful con-tem-pla-tion seemed scarce-ly en-ti-tled to a mo-men-tâ s thought the dis-mal look-ing wreck and the hor-rid aspect and re-venge of the whale whol-ly en-grossed my re-flec-tions un-til day again made its ap-pear-ance â In another placeâ p 45 â he speaks of â the mys-te-ri-ous and mor-tal at-tack of the an-i-mal â Se-cond-ly The ship Union al-so of Nan-tuck-et was in the year 187 to-tal-ly lost off the Azores by a sim-i-lar onset but the authen-tic par-tic-u-lars of this catas-tro-phe I have nev-er chanced to en-counter though from the whale hun-ters I have now and then heard ca-su-al al-lu-sions to it Third-ly Some eigh-teen or twen-ty years ago Com-modore Jâ â then com-mand-ing an Amer-i-can sloop of war of the first class hap-pened to be din-ing with a par-ty of whal-ing cap-tains on board a Nan-tuck-et ship in the har-bor of Oahu Sand-wich Is-lands Con-ver-sa-tion turn-ing upon whales the Com-modore was pleased to be scep-ti-cal touch-ing the amaz-ing strength ascribed to them by the pro-fes-sion-al gentle-men pre-sent He peremp-to-ri-ly de-nied for ex-am-ple that any whale could so smite his stout sloop of war as to cause her to leak so much as a thim-ble-ful Very good but there is more com-ing Some weeks after the Com-modore set sail in this im-preg-nable craft for Val-paraiso But he was stopped on the way by a port-ly sperm whale that begged a few mo-mentsâ con-fi-den-tial busi-ness with him That busi-ness con-sist-ed in fetch-ing the Com-modor-eâ s craft such a thwack that with all his pumps go-ing he made straight for the near-est port to heave down and re-pair I am not su-per-sti-tious but I con-sid-er the Com-modor-eâ s in-ter-view with that whale as prov-i-den-tial Was not Saul of Tar-sus con-vert-ed from un-be-lief by a sim-i-lar fright I tell you the sperm whale will stand no non-sense I will now re-fer you to Langs-dorf-fâ s Voy-ages for a lit-tle cir-cum-stance in point pe-cu-liar-ly in-ter-est-ing to the writ-er here-of Langs-dorff you must know by the way was at-tached to the Rus-sian Ad-mi-ral Krusen-sternâ s fa-mous Dis-cov-ery Ex-pe-di-tion in the begin-ning of the pre-sent cen-tu-ry Cap-tain Langs-dorff thus be-gins his seven-teenth chap-ter â By the thir-teenth of May our ship was ready to sail and the next day we were out in the open sea on our way to Ochotsh The weather was very clear and fine but so in-tol-er-a-bly cold that we were obliged to keep on our fur cloth-ing For some days we had very lit-tle wind it was not till the nine-teenth that a brisk gale from the north-west sprang up An un-com-mon large whale the body of which was larg-er than the ship it-self lay al-most at the sur-face of the water but was not per-ceived by any one on board till the mo-ment when the ship which was in full sail was al-most upon him so that it was im-pos-si-ble to prevent its strik-ing against him We were thus placed in the most im-mi-nent danger as this gi-gan-tic crea-ture set-ting up its back raised the ship three feet at least out of the water The masts reeled and the sails fell al-to-geth-er while we who were below all sprang in-stant-ly upon the deck con-clud-ing that we had struck upon some rock in-stead of this we saw the mon-ster sail-ing off with the ut-most grav-i-ty and solem-ni-ty Cap-tain Dâ Wolf ap-plied im-me-di-ate-ly to the pumps to ex-am-ine whether or not the ves-sel had re-ceived any da-m-age from the shock but we found that very hap-pi-ly it had es-caped en-tire-ly un-in-jured â Now the Cap-tain Dâ Wolf here al-lud-ed to as com-mand-ing the ship in ques-tion is a New Eng-lan-der who after a long life of unusu-al ad-ven-tures as a sea cap-tain this day re-sides in the vil-lage of Dorch-ester near Bos-ton I have the honor of be-ing a nephew of his I have par-tic-u-lar-ly ques-tioned him con-cern-ing this pas-sage in Langs-dorff He sub-stan-ti-ates every word The ship how-ev-er was by no means a large one a Rus-sian craft built on the Siberi-an coast and pur-chased by my un-cle after bar-ter-ing away the ves-sel in which he sailed from home In that up and down man-ly book of old fash-ioned ad-ven-ture so full too of hon-est won-der-sâ the voy-age of Lionel Wafer one of an-cient Dampierâ s old chum-sâ I found a lit-tle mat-ter set down so like that just quot-ed from Langs-dorff that I can-not for-bear insert-ing it here for a cor-rob-o-ra-tive ex-am-ple if such be need-ed Lionel it seems was on his way to â John Fer-di-nan-do â as he cal-ls the modern Juan Fer-nan-des â In our way thith-er â he says â about four oâ clock in the morn-ing when we were about one hun-dred and fifty leagues from the Main of Amer-i-ca our ship felt a ter-ri-ble shock which put our men in such con-ster-na-tion that they could hard-ly tell where they were or what to think but every one be-gan to pre-pare for death And in-deed the shock was so sud-den and vi-o-lent that we took it for grant-ed the ship had struck against a rock but when the amaze-ment was a lit-tle over we cast the lead and sound-ed but found no ground The sud-den-ness of the shock made the guns leap in their car-riages and sev-er-al of the men were shak-en out of their ham-mocks Cap-tain Davis who lay with his head on a gun was thrown out of his cabin â Lionel then goes on to im-pute the shock to an earthquake and seems to sub-stan-ti-ate the im-pu-ta-tion by stat-ing that a great earthquake some-where about that time did ac-tu-al-ly do great mis-chief along the Span-ish land But I should not much won-der if in the dark-ness of that ear-ly hour of the morn-ing the shock was after all caused by an unseen whale ver-ti-cal-ly bump-ing the hull from be-neath I might pro-ceed with sev-er-al more ex-am-ples one way or another known to me of the great pow-er and mal-ice at times of the sperm whale In more than one in-stance he has been known not on-ly to chase the as-sail-ing boats back to their ships but to pur-sue the ship it-self and long with-stand all the lances hurled at him from its decks The English ship Pusie Hall can tell a sto-ry on that head and as for his strength let me say that there have been ex-am-ples where the lines at-tached to a run-ning sperm whale have in a calm been trans-ferred to the ship and se-cured there the whale tow-ing her great hull through the water as a horse walks off with a cart Again it is very often ob-served that if the sperm whale once struck is al-lowed time to ral-ly he then ac-ts not so often with blind rage as with wil-ful de-lib-er-ate de-signs of destruc-tion to his pur-suers nor is it without con-vey-ing some elo-quent indi-ca-tion of his char-ac-ter that upon be-ing at-tacked he will fre-quent-ly open his mouth and re-tain it in that dread ex-pan-sion for sev-er-al con-sec-u-tive min-utes But I must be con-tent with on-ly one more and a con-clud-ing il-lus-tra-tion a re-mark-able and most sig-nif-i-cant one by which you will not fail to see that not on-ly is the most marvel-lous event in this book cor-rob-o-rat-ed by plain fac-ts of the pre-sent day but that th-ese marvels like all marvels are mere rep-e-ti-tions of the ages so that for the mil-lionth time we say amen with Solomonâ Ver-i-ly there is noth-ing new un-der the sun In the sixth Chris-tian cen-tu-ry lived Pro-copius a Chris-tian mag-is-trate of Con-stantino-ple in the days when Jus-tini-an was Em-per-or and Belis-ar-ius gen-er-al As many know he wrote the his-to-ry of his own times a work every way of un-com-mon value By the best author-i-ties he has al-ways been con-sid-ered a most trust-wor-thy and unex-ag-ger-at-ing his-to-ri-an ex-cept in some one or two par-tic-u-lars not at all af-fect-ing the mat-ter present-ly to be men-tioned Now in this his-to-ry of his Pro-copius men-tions that dur-ing the term of his pre-fec-ture at Con-stantino-ple a great sea mon-ster was cap-tured in the neigh-bor-ing Pro-pon-tis or Sea of Marmo-ra after hav-ing de-stroyed ves-sels at in-ter-vals in those waters for a pe-ri-od of more than fifty years A fact thus set down in sub-stan-tial his-to-ry can-not easi-ly be gain-said Nor is there any rea-son it should be Of what pre-cise species this sea mon-ster was is not men-tioned But as he de-stroyed ships as well as for other rea-sons he must have been a whale and I am strong-ly in-clined to think a sperm whale And I will tell you why For a long time I fan-cied that the sperm whale had been al-ways un-known in the Mediter-ranean and the deep waters con-nect-ing with it Even now I am cer-tain that those seas are not and per-haps nev-er can be in the pre-sent con-sti-tu-tion of things a place for his ha-bit-u-al gre-gar-i-ous re-sort But fur-ther in-ves-ti-ga-tions have re-cent-ly proved to me that in modern times there have been iso-lat-ed in-stances of the pres-ence of the sperm whale in the Mediter-ranean I am told on good author-i-ty that on the Bar-bary coast a Com-modore Davis of the Bri-tish navy found the skele-ton of a sperm whale Now as a ves-sel of war read-i-ly pass-es through the Dar-danelles hence a sperm whale could by the same route pass out of the Mediter-ranean in-to the Pro-pon-tis In the Pro-pon-tis as far as I can learn none of that pe-cu-liar sub-stance called brit is to be found the ali-ment of the right whale But I have every rea-son to believe that the food of the sperm whaleâ squid or cut-tle fishâ lurks at the bot-tom of that sea be-cause large crea-tures but by no means the largest of that sort have been found at its sur-face If then you prop-er-ly put th-ese state-men-ts to-geth-er and rea-son upon them a bit you will clear-ly per-ceive that ac-cord-ing to all hu-man rea-son-ing Pro-copiusâ s sea mon-ster that for half a cen-tu-ry stove the ships of a Ro-man Em-per-or must in all prob-a-bil-i-ty have been a sperm whale CHAPTER 46 Sur-mis-es Though con-sumed with the hot fire of his pur-pose Ahab in all his thoughts and ac-tions ever had in view the ul-ti-mate cap-ture of Mo-by Dick though he seemed ready to sacri-fice all mor-tal in-ter-ests to that one pas-sion nev-er-the-less it may have been that he was by na-ture and long ha-bit-u-a-tion far too wed-ded to a fiery whale-manâ s ways al-to-geth-er to aban-don the col-lat-er-al prose-cu-tion of the voy-age Or at least if this were other-wise there were not want-ing other mo-tives much more in-flu-en-tial with him It would be refin-ing too much per-haps even con-sid-er-ing his mono-ma-nia to hint that his vin-dic-tive-ness towards the White Whale might have pos-si-bly ex-tend-ed it-self in some de-gree to all sperm whales and that the more mon-sters he slew by so much the more he mul-ti-plied the chances that each sub-se-quent-ly en-coun-tered whale would prove to be the hat-ed one he hunt-ed But if such an hy-poth-e-sis be in-deed ex-cep-tion-able there were still ad-di-tion-al con-sid-er-a-tions which though not so strict-ly ac-cord-ing with the wild-ness of his rul-ing pas-sion yet were by no means in-ca-pable of sway-ing him To ac-com-plish his ob-ject Ahab must use tools and of all tools used in the shad-ow of the moon men are most apt to get out of order He knew for ex-am-ple that how-ev-er mag-net-ic his as-cen-den-cy in some re-spec-ts was over Star-buck yet that as-cen-den-cy did not cover the com-plete spir-i-tu-al man any more than mere cor-po-re-al su-pe-ri-or-i-ty in-volves in-tel-lec-tu-al master-ship for to the pure-ly spir-i-tu-al the in-tel-lec-tu-al but stand in a sort of cor-po-re-al re-la-tion Star-buckâ s body and Star-buckâ s co-erced will were Ahabâ s so long as Ahab kept his mag-net at Star-buckâ s brain still he knew that for all this the chief mate in his soul ab-horred his cap-tainâ s quest and could he would joy-ful-ly dis-in-te-grate him-self from it or even frus-trate it It might be that a long in-ter-val would elapse ere the White Whale was seen Dur-ing that long in-ter-val Star-buck would ever be apt to fall in-to open re-laps-es of re-bel-lion against his cap-tainâ s lead-er-ship un-less some or-di-nary pru-den-tial cir-cum-stan-tial in-flu-ences were brought to bear upon him Not on-ly that but the sub-tle in-san-i-ty of Ahab re-spect-ing Mo-by Dick was noways more sig-nif-i-cant-ly man-i-fest-ed than in his su-perla-tive sense and shrewd-ness in fore-see-ing that for the pre-sent the hunt should in some way be stripped of that strange imag-i-na-tive im-pi-ous-ness which nat-u-ral-ly in-vest-ed it that the full ter-ror of the voy-age must be kept with-drawn in-to the ob-scure back-ground for few menâ s courage is proof against pro-tract-ed med-i-ta-tion un-re-lieved by ac-tion that when they stood their long night watch-es his of-fi-cers and men must have some nearer things to think of than Mo-by Dick For how-ev-er eager-ly and im-petu-ous-ly the sav-age crew had hailed the an-nounce-ment of his quest yet all sailors of all sorts are more or less capri-cious and un-re-li-ableâ they live in the vary-ing outer weather and they in-hale its fick-le-nessâ and when re-tained for any ob-ject re-mote and blank in the pur-suit how-ev-er promis-so-ry of life and pas-sion in the end it is above all things req-ui-site that tem-po-rary in-ter-ests and em-ploy-men-ts should in-ter-vene and hold them healthi-ly sus-pend-ed for the fi-nal dash Nor was Ahab un-mind-ful of another thing In times of strong emo-tion mankind dis-dain all base con-sid-er-a-tions but such times are evanes-cent The per-ma-nent con-sti-tu-tion-al con-di-tion of the man-u-fac-tured man thought Ahab is sor-did-ness Grant-ing that the White Whale ful-ly incites the hearts of this my sav-age crew and play-ing round their sav-age-ness even breeds a cer-tain gen-er-ous knight er-ran-tism in them still while for the love of it they give chase to Mo-by Dick they must al-so have food for their more com-mon dai-ly ap-petites For even the high lift-ed and chival-ric Cru-saders of old times were not con-tent to tra-verse two thou-sand miles of land to fight for their holy sepul-chre without com-mit-ting bur-glar-ies pick-ing pock-ets and gain-ing other pious perquisites by the way Had they been strict-ly held to their one fi-nal and ro-man-tic ob-jec-tâ that fi-nal and ro-man-tic ob-ject too many would have turned from in dis-gust I will not strip th-ese men thought Ahab of all hopes of cashâ aye cash They may scorn cash now but let some months go by and no per-spec-tive promise of it to them and then this same qui-es-cent cash all at once mutiny-ing in them this same cash would soon cashier Ahab Nor was there want-ing still another pre-cau-tion-ary mo-tive more re-lat-ed to Ahab per-son-al-ly Hav-ing im-pul-sive-ly it is prob-a-ble and per-haps some-what pre-ma-ture-ly re-vealed the prime but pri-vate pur-pose of the Pe-quodâ s voy-age Ahab was now en-tire-ly con-scious that in so do-ing he had indi-rect-ly laid him-self open to the unan-swer-able charge of usur-pa-tion and with per-fect im-puni-ty both mo-ral and le-gal his crew if so dis-posed and to that end com-pe-tent could refuse all fur-ther obe-di-ence to him and even vi-o-lent-ly wrest from him the com-mand From even the bare-ly hint-ed im-pu-ta-tion of usur-pa-tion and the pos-si-ble con-se-quences of such a sup-pressed im-pres-sion gain-ing ground Ahab must of course have been most anx-ious to pro-tect him-self That pro-tec-tion could on-ly con-sist in his own pre-dom-i-nat-ing brain and heart and hand backed by a heed-ful close-ly cal-cu-lat-ing at-ten-tion to every minute at-mo-spher-ic in-flu-ence which it was pos-si-ble for his crew to be sub-ject-ed to For all th-ese rea-sons then and others per-haps too an-a-lyt-ic to be ver-bal-ly devel-oped here Ahab plain-ly saw that he must still in a good de-gree con-tin-ue true to the nat-u-ral nom-i-nal pur-pose of the Pe-quodâ s voy-age ob-serve all cus-tom-ary usages and not on-ly that but force him-self to evince all his well known pas-sion-ate in-ter-est in the gen-er-al pur-suit of his pro-fes-sion Be all this as it may his voice was now often heard hail-ing the three mast heads and ad-mon-ish-ing them to keep a bright look out and not omit re-port-ing even a por-poise This vig-i-lance was not long without re-ward CHAPTER 47 The Mat Mak-er It was a cloudy sul-try after-noon the sea-men were lazi-ly loung-ing about the decks or va-cant-ly gaz-ing over in-to the lead coloured waters Quee-queg and I were mild-ly em-ployed weav-ing what is called a sword mat for an ad-di-tion-al lash-ing to our boat So still and sub-dued and yet some-how pre-lud-ing was all the scene and such an in-can-ta-tion of rev-er-ie lurked in the air that each si-lent sailor seemed re-solved in-to his own in-vis-i-ble self I was the at-ten-dant or page of Quee-queg while busy at the mat As I kept pass-ing and repass-ing the filling or woof of mar-line between the long yarns of the warp us-ing my own hand for the shut-tle and as Quee-queg stand-ing side-ways ever and anon slid his heavy oak-en sword between the threads and id-ly look-ing off upon the water care-less-ly and un-think-ing-ly drove home every yarn I say so strange a dreami-ness did there then reign all over the ship and all over the sea on-ly bro-ken by the in-ter-mit-ting dull sound of the sword that it seemed as if this were the Loom of Time and I my-self were a shut-tle me-chan-i-cal-ly weav-ing and weav-ing away at the Fates There lay the fixed threads of the warp sub-ject to but one sin-gle ever re-turn-ing un-chang-ing vi-bra-tion and that vi-bra-tion mere-ly enough to ad-mit of the cross-wise in-terblend-ing of other threads with its own This warp seemed ne-ces-si-ty and here thought I with my own hand I ply my own shut-tle and weave my own destiny in-to th-ese unal-ter-able threads Mean-time Quee-quegâ s im-pul-sive in-dif-fer-ent sword some-times hit-ting the woof slant-ing-ly or crooked-ly or strong-ly or weak-ly as the case might be and by this dif-fer-ence in the con-clud-ing blow pro-duc-ing a cor-re-spond-ing con-trast in the fi-nal aspect of the com-plet-ed fabric this sav-ageâ s sword thought I which thus fi-nal-ly shapes and fash-ions both warp and woof this easy in-dif-fer-ent sword must be chanceâ aye chance free will and ne-ces-si-tyâ no-wise in-com-pat-i-bleâ all in-ter-weav-ing-ly work-ing to-geth-er The straight warp of ne-ces-si-ty not to be sw-erved from its ul-ti-mate courseâ its every al-ter-nat-ing vi-bra-tion in-deed on-ly tend-ing to that free will still free to ply her shut-tle between giv-en threads and chance though res-trained in its play within the right lines of ne-ces-si-ty and side-ways in its mo-tions direct-ed by free will though thus pre-scribed to by both chance by turns rules either and has the last fea-tur-ing blow at even-ts Thus we were weav-ing and weav-ing away when I start-ed at a sound so strange long drawn and mu-si-cal-ly wild and un-earth-ly that the ball of free will dropped from my hand and I stood gaz-ing up at the clouds whence that voice dropped like a wing High aloft in the cross trees was that mad Gay Head-er Tashtego His body was reach-ing eager-ly for-ward his hand stretched out like a wand and at brief sud-den in-ter-vals he con-tin-ued his cries To be sure the same sound was that very mo-ment per-haps be-ing heard all over the seas from hun-dreds of whale-menâ s look outs perched as high in the air but from few of those lungs could that ac-cus-tomed old cry have derived such a marvel-lous cadence as from Tashtego the In-di-anâ s As he stood hover-ing over you half sus-pend-ed in air so wild-ly and eager-ly peer-ing towards the hori-zon you would have thought him some prophet or seer be-hold-ing the shad-ows of Fate and by those wild cries an-nounc-ing their com-ing â There she blows there there there she blows she blows â â Where away â â On the lee beam about two miles off a school of them â In-stant-ly all was com-mo-tion The Sperm Whale blows as a clock ticks with the same un-de-vi-at-ing and reli-able uni-for-mi-ty And there-by whale-men distin-guish this fish from other tribes of his genus â There go flukes â was now the cry from Tashtego and the whales dis-ap-peared â Quick ste-ward â cried Ahab â Time time â Dough Boy hur-ried below glanced at the watch and re-port-ed the ex-act minute to Ahab The ship was now kept away from the wind and she went gent-ly rolling be-fore it Tashtego re-port-ing that the whales had gone down head-ing to lee-ward we con-fi-dent-ly looked to see them again direct-ly in ad-vance of our bows For that sin-gu-lar craft at times evinced by the Sperm Whale when sound-ing with his head in one direc-tion he nev-er-the-less while con-cealed be-neath the sur-face mil-ls round and swift-ly swims off in the op-po-site quar-terâ this de-ceit-ful-ness of his could not now be in ac-tion for there was no rea-son to sup-pose that the fish seen by Tashtego had been in any way alarmed or in-deed knew at all of our vicin-i-ty One of the men select-ed for ship-keep-er-sâ that is those not ap-point-ed to the boats by this time relieved the In-di-an at the main mast head The sailors at the fore and mizzen had come down the line tubs were fixed in their places the cranes were thrust out the main-yard was backed and the three boats swung over the sea like three sam-phire bas-kets over high cliffs Out-side of the bul-warks their eager crews with one hand clung to the rail while one foot was ex-pec-tant-ly poised on the gun-wale So look the long line of man of warâ s men about to throw them-selves on board an ene-myâ s ship But at this crit-i-cal in-stant a sud-den ex-cla-ma-tion was heard that took every eye from the whale With a start all glared at dark Ahab who was sur-round-ed by five dusky phan-toms that seemed fresh formed out of air CHAPTER 48 The First Low-er-ing The phan-toms for so they then seemed were flit-ting on the other side of the deck and with a noise-less celer-i-ty were cast-ing loose the tack-les and bands of the boat which swung there This boat had al-ways been deemed one of the spare boats though tech-ni-cal-ly called the cap-tainâ s on ac-count of its hang-ing from the star-board quar-ter The fig-ure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart with one white tooth evil-ly protrud-ing from its steel like lips A rumpled Chi-nese jack-et of black cot-ton fune-re-al-ly in-vest-ed him with wide black trowsers of the same dark stuff But strange-ly crown-ing this ebon-ness was a glis-ten-ing white plait-ed tur-ban the liv-ing hair braid-ed and coiled round and round upon his head Less swart in aspect the com-pan-ions of this fig-ure were of that vivid tiger yel-low com-plex-ion pe-cu-liar to some of the abo-rig-i-nal na-tives of the Manil-las â a race no-to-ri-ous for a cer-tain di-abolism of subtilty and by some hon-est white mariners sup-posed to be the paid spies and se-cret con-fi-den-tial agen-ts on the water of the devil their lord whose count-ing room they sup-pose to be else-where While yet the won-der-ing shipâ s com-pa-ny were gaz-ing upon th-ese strangers Ahab cried out to the white tur-baned old man at their head â All ready there Fedal-lah â â Ready â was the half hissed re-ply â Low-er away then dâ ye hear â shout-ing across the deck â Low-er away there I say â Such was the thun-der of his voice that spite of their amaze-ment the men sprang over the rail the sheaves whirled round in the blocks with a wal-low the three boats dropped in-to the sea while with a dex-ter-ous off hand-ed dar-ing un-known in any other vo-ca-tion the sailors goat like leaped down the rolling shipâ s side in-to the tossed boats below Hard-ly had they pulled out from un-der the shipâ s lee when a fourth keel com-ing from the wind-ward side pulled round un-der the stern and showed the five strangers row-ing Ahab who stand-ing erect in the stern loud-ly hailed Star-buck Stubb and Flask to spread them-selves wide-ly so as to cover a large ex-panse of water But with all their eyes again rivet-ed upon the swart Fedal-lah and his crew the in-mates of the other boats obeyed not the com-mand â Cap-tain Ahab â â said Star-buck â Spread your-selves â cried Ahab â give way all four boats Thou Flask pull out more to lee-ward â â Aye aye sir â cheer-i-ly cried lit-tle King Post sweep-ing round his great steer-ing oar â Lay back â ad-dress-ing his crew â There â there â there again There she blows right ahead boys â lay back â â Nev-er heed yon-der yel-low boys Archy â â Oh I donâ t mind â em sir â said Archy â I knew it all be-fore now Did-nâ t I hear â em in the hold And did-nâ t I tell Caba-co here of it What say ye Caba-co They are stow-aways Mr Flask â â Pull pull my fine hearts alive pull my chil-dren pull my lit-tle ones â drawl-ing-ly and sooth-ing-ly sighed Stubb to his crew some of whom still showed signs of uneasi-ness â Why donâ t you break your back-bones my boys What is it you stare at Those chaps in yon-der boat Tut They are on-ly five more hands come to help usâ nev-er mind from whereâ the more the mer-ri-er Pull then do pull nev-er mind the brim-stoneâ devils are good fel-lows enough So so there you are now thatâ s the stroke for a thou-sand pounds thatâ s

it my steel bits Start herâ start her my sil-ver spoons Start her mar-ling spikes â Stub-bâ s ex-ordi-um to his crew is giv-en here at large be-cause he had rather a pe-cu-liar way of talk-ing to them in gen-er-al and espe-cial-ly in in-cul-cat-ing the reli-gion of row-ing But you must not sup-pose from this spec-i-men of his ser-mo-niz-ings that he ever flew in-to down-right pas-sions with his con-gre-ga-tion Not at all and there-in con-sist-ed his chief pe-cu-liar-i-ty He would say the most ter-rif-ic things to his crew in a tone so strange-ly com-pound-ed of fun and fury and the fury seemed so cal-cu-lat-ed mere-ly as a spice to the fun that no oars-man could hear such queer in-vo-ca-tions without pulling for dear life and yet pulling for the mere joke of the thing Be-sides he all the time looked so easy and in-do-lent him-self so loung-ing-ly man-aged his steer-ing oar and so broad-ly gapedâ open mouthed at timesâ that the mere sight of such a yawn-ing com-man-der by sheer force of con-trast act-ed like a charm upon the crew Then again Stubb was one of those odd sort of hu-morists whose jol-li-ty is some-times so cu-ri-ous-ly am-bigu-ous as to put all in-fe-ri-ors on their guard in the mat-ter of obey-ing them In obe-di-ence to a sign from Ahab Star-buck was now pulling oblique-ly across Stub-bâ s bow and when for a minute or so the two boats were pret-ty near to each other Stubb hailed the mate â Mr Star-buck lar-board boat there ahoy a word with ye sir if ye please â â Hal-loa â re-turned Star-buck turn-ing round not a sin-gle inch as he spoke still earnest-ly but whis-per-ing-ly urg-ing his crew his face set like a flint from Stub-bâ s â What think ye of those yel-low boys sir â â Smug-gled on board some-how be-fore the ship sailed Strong strong boys â in a whis-per to his crew then speak-ing out loud again â A sad busi-ness Mr Stubb seethe her seethe her my lads but nev-er mind Mr Stubb all for the best Let all your crew pull strong come what will Spring my men spring Thereâ s hogsheads of sperm ahead Mr Stubb and thatâ s what ye came for Pull my boys Sperm sper-mâ s the play This at least is du-ty du-ty and profit hand in hand â â Aye aye I thought as much â so-lil-o-quized Stubb when the boats diverged â as soon as I clapt eye on â em I thought so Aye and thatâ s what he went in-to the after hold for so often as Dough Boy long sus-pect-ed They were hid-den down there The White Whaleâ s at the bot-tom of it Well well so be it Canâ t be helped All right Give way men It ainâ t the White Whale to day Give way â Now the ad-vent of th-ese out-landish strangers at such a crit-i-cal in-stant as the low-er-ing of the boats from the deck this had not un-rea-son-ably awak-ened a sort of su-per-sti-tious amaze-ment in some of the shipâ s com-pa-ny but Archyâ s fan-cied dis-cov-ery hav-ing some time pre-vi-ous got abroad among them though in-deed not cred-it-ed then this had in some small mea-sure pre-pared them for the event It took off the ex-treme edge of their won-der and so what with all this and Stub-bâ s con-fi-dent way of ac-count-ing for their ap-pear-ance they were for the time freed from su-per-sti-tious sur-mis-ings though the af-fair still left abun-dant room for all man-ner of wild con-jec-tures as to dark Ahabâ s pre-cise agen-cy in the mat-ter from the begin-ning For me I si-lent-ly re-called the mys-te-ri-ous shad-ows I had seen creep-ing on board the Pe-quod dur-ing the dim Nan-tuck-et dawn as well as the enig-mat-i-cal hint-ings of the unac-count-able Eli-jah Mean-time Ahab out of hear-ing of his of-fi-cers hav-ing sid-ed the fur-thest to wind-ward was still rang-ing ahead of the other boats a cir-cum-stance be-s-peak-ing how po-tent a crew was pulling him Those tiger yel-low crea-tures of his seemed all steel and whale-bone like five trip ham-mers they rose and fell with reg-u-lar strokes of strength which pe-ri-od-i-cal-ly start-ed the boat along the water like a hor-i-zon-tal burst boil-er out of a Mis-sis-sip-pi steam-er As for Fedal-lah who was seen pulling the har-pooneer oar he had thrown aside his black jack-et and dis-played his naked ch-est with the whole part of his body above the gun-wale clear-ly cut against the al-ter-nat-ing de-pres-sions of the watery hori-zon while at the other end of the boat Ahab with one arm like a fencerâ s thrown half back-ward in-to the air as if to coun-ter-bal-ance any ten-den-cy to trip Ahab was seen steadi-ly manag-ing his steer-ing oar as in a thou-sand boat low-er-ings ere the White Whale had torn him All at once the out-stretched arm gave a pe-cu-liar mo-tion and then re-mained fixed while the boatâ s five oars were seen si-mul-ta-ne-ous-ly peaked Boat and crew sat mo-tion-less on the sea In-stant-ly the three spread boats in the rear paused on their way The whales had ir-reg-u-lar-ly set-tled bodi-ly down in-to the blue thus giv-ing no dis-tant-ly dis-cernible to-ken of the move-ment though from his clos-er vicin-i-ty Ahab had ob-served it â Every man look out along his oars â cried Star-buck â Thou Quee-queg stand up â Nim-bly spring-ing up on the tri-an-gu-lar raised box in the bow the sav-age stood erect there and with in-tense-ly eager eyes gazed off towards the spot where the chase had last been de-scried Like-wise upon the ex-treme stern of the boat where it was al-so tri-an-gu-lar-ly plat-formed lev-el with the gun-wale Star-buck him-self was seen cool-ly and adroit-ly balanc-ing him-self to the jerk-ing toss-ings of his chip of a craft and si-lent-ly eye-ing the vast blue eye of the sea Not very far dis-tant Flaskâ s boat was al-so ly-ing breath-less-ly still its com-man-der reck-less-ly stand-ing upon the top of the log-ger-head a stout sort of post root-ed in the keel and ris-ing some two feet above the lev-el of the stern plat-form It is used for catch-ing turns with the whale line Its top is not more spa-cious than the palm of a manâ s hand and stand-ing upon such a base as that Flask seemed perched at the mast head of some ship which had sunk to all but her trucks But lit-tle King Post was small and short and at the same time lit-tle King Post was full of a large and tall am-bi-tion so that this log-ger-head stand point of his did by no means sat-is-fy King Post â I canâ t see three seas off tip us up an oar there and let me on to that â Upon this Dag-goo with either hand upon the gun-wale to steady his way swift-ly slid aft and then erect-ing him-self vol-un-teered his lofty shoul-ders for a pedestal â Good a mast head as any sir Will you mount â â That I will and thank ye very much my fine fel-low on-ly I wish you fifty feet taller â Where-upon plant-ing his feet firm-ly against two op-po-site planks of the boat the gi-gan-tic ne-gro stoop-ing a lit-tle pre-sent-ed his flat palm to Flaskâ s foot and then put-ting Flaskâ s hand on his hearse plumed head and bid-ding him spring as he him-self should toss with one dex-ter-ous fling land-ed the lit-tle man high and dry on his shoul-ders And here was Flask now stand-ing Dag-goo with one lift-ed arm fur-nish-ing him with a breast-band to lean against and steady him-self by At any time it is a strange sight to the ty-ro to see with what won-drous habi-tude of un-con-scious skill the whale-man will main-tain an erect pos-ture in his boat even when pitched about by the most riotous-ly per-verse and cross run-ning seas Still more strange to see him gid-di-ly perched upon the log-ger-head it-self un-der such cir-cum-stances But the sight of lit-tle Flask mount-ed upon gi-gan-tic Dag-goo was yet more cu-ri-ous for sus-tain-ing him-self with a cool in-dif-fer-ent easy un-thought of bar-bar-ic majesty the noble ne-gro to every roll of the sea har-mo-nious-ly rolled his fine form On his broad back flax-en haired Flask seemed a snow flake The bearer looked nobler than the rider Though tru-ly vi-va-cious tu-mul-tuous os-ten-ta-tious lit-tle Flask would now and then stamp with im-pa-tience but not one added heave did he there-by give to the ne-groâ s lord-ly ch-est So have I seen Pas-sion and Van-i-ty stamp-ing the liv-ing mag-nan-i-mous earth but the earth did not al-ter her tides and her sea-sons for that Mean-while Stubb the third mate be-trayed no such far gaz-ing solic-i-tudes The whales might have made one of their reg-u-lar sound-ings not a tem-po-rary dive from mere fright and if that were the case Stubb as his wont in such cas-es it seems was re-solved to so-lace the lan-guish-ing in-ter-val with his pipe He with-drew it from his hat-band where he al-ways wore it as-lant like a feather He load-ed it and rammed home the load-ing with his thumb end but hard-ly had he ig-nit-ed his match across the rough sand-pa-per of his hand when Tashtego his har-pooneer whose eyes had been set-ting to wind-ward like two fixed stars sud-den-ly dropped like light from his erect at-ti-tude to his seat cry-ing out in a quick phren-sy of hur-ry â Down down all and give way â there they are â To a lands-man no whale nor any sign of a her-ring would have been vis-i-ble at that mo-ment noth-ing but a trou-bled bit of green-ish white water and thin scat-tered puffs of va-por hover-ing over it and suf-fus-ing-ly blow-ing off to lee-ward like the con-fused scud from white rolling bil-lows The air around sud-den-ly vi-brat-ed and tin-gled as it were like the air over in-tense-ly heat-ed plates of iron Be-neath this at-mo-spher-ic wav-ing and curl-ing and par-tial-ly be-neath a thin lay-er of water al-so the whales were swim-ming Seen in ad-vance of all the other indi-ca-tions the puffs of va-por they spout-ed seemed their fore-run-ning couri-ers and de-tached fly-ing outrid-ers All four boats were now in keen pur-suit of that one spot of trou-bled water and air But it bade fair to out-strip them it flew on and on as a mass of in-terblend-ing bub-bles borne down a rapid stream from the hil-ls â Pull pull my good boys â said Star-buck in the low-est pos-si-ble but in-tens-est con-cen-trat-ed whis-per to his men while the sharp fixed glance from his eyes dart-ed straight ahead of the bow al-most seemed as two vis-i-ble nee-dles in two un-erring bin-na-cle com-pass-es He did not say much to his crew though nor did his crew say any-thing to him On-ly the si-lence of the boat was at in-ter-vals startling-ly pierced by one of his pe-cu-liar whis-pers now harsh with com-mand now soft with en-treaty How dif-fer-ent the loud lit-tle King Post â Sing out and say some-thing my hearties Roar and pull my thun-der-bolts Beach me beach me on their black backs boys on-ly do that for me and Iâ ll sign over to you my Marthaâ s Vine-yard plan-ta-tion boys in-clud-ing wife and chil-dren boys Lay me onâ lay me on O Lord Lord but I shall go stark star-ing mad See see that white water â And so shout-ing he pulled his hat from his head and stamped up and down on it then pick-ing it up flirt-ed it far off upon the sea and fi-nal-ly fell to rear-ing and plung-ing in the boatâ s stern like a crazed colt from the prair-ie â Look at that chap now â philo-soph-i-cal-ly drawled Stubb who with his un-light-ed short pipe me-chan-i-cal-ly re-tained between his teeth at a short dis-tance fol-lowed afterâ â Heâ s got fits that Flask has Fits yes give him fit-sâ thatâ s the very wordâ pitch fits in-to â em Mer-ri-ly mer-ri-ly hearts alive Pud-ding for sup-per you know â mer-ryâ s the word Pull babesâ pull suck-lingsâ pull all But what the devil are you hur-ry-ing about Soft-ly soft-ly and steadi-ly my men On-ly pull and keep pulling noth-ing more Crack all your back-bones and bite your knives in twoâ thatâ s all Take it easyâ why donâ t ye take it easy I say and burst all your livers and lungs â But what it was that in-scrutable Ahab said to that tiger yel-low crew of hisâ th-ese were words best omit-ted here for you live un-der the blessed light of the evan-gel-i-cal land On-ly the in-fi-del sharks in the au-da-cious seas may give ear to such words when with tor-na-do brow and eyes of red mur-der and foam glued lips Ahab leaped after his prey Mean-while all the boats tore on The re-peat-ed spe-cif-ic al-lu-sions of Flask to â that whale â as he called the fic-ti-tious mon-ster which he de-clared to be inces-sant-ly tan-taliz-ing his boatâ s bow with its tailâ th-ese al-lu-sions of his were at times so vivid and life like that they would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fear-ful look over the shoul-der But this was against all rule for the oars-men must put out their eyes and ram a skew-er through their necks usage pro-nounc-ing that they must have no or-gans but ears and no lim-bs but ar-ms in th-ese crit-i-cal mo-men-ts It was a sight full of quick won-der and awe The vast swells of the om-nipo-tent sea the surg-ing hol-low roar they made as they rolled along the eight gun-wales like gi-gan-tic bowls in a bound-less bowl-ing green the brief sus-pend-ed agony of the boat as it would tip for an in-stant on the knife like edge of the sharp-er waves that al-most seemed threat-en-ing to cut it in two the sud-den pro-found dip in-to the watery glens and hol-lows the keen spurrings and goad-ings to gain the top of the op-po-site hill the head-long sled like slide down its other side â all th-ese with the cries of the heads-men and har-pooneers and the shud-der-ing gasps of the oars-men with the won-drous sight of the ivory Pe-quod bear-ing down upon her boats with out-stretched sails like a wild hen after her scream-ing brood â all this was thrilling Not the raw re-cruit march-ing from the bo-som of his wife in-to the fev-er heat of his first bat-tle not the dead manâ s ghost en-coun-ter-ing the first un-known phan-tom in the other world â nei-ther of th-ese can feel stranger and stronger emo-tions than that man does who for the first time finds him-self pulling in-to the charmed churned cir-cle of the hunt-ed sperm whale The danc-ing white water made by the chase was now be-com-ing more and more vis-i-ble owing to the in-creas-ing dark-ness of the dun cloud shad-ows flung upon the sea The jets of va-por no longer blend-ed but tilt-ed every-where to right and left the whales seemed separat-ing their wakes The boats were pulled more apart Star-buck giv-ing chase to three whales run-ning dead to lee-ward Our sail was now set and with the still ris-ing wind we rushed along the boat go-ing with such mad-ness through the water that the lee oars could scarce-ly be worked rapid-ly enough to es-cape be-ing torn from the row locks Soon we were run-ning through a suf-fus-ing wide veil of mist nei-ther ship nor boat to be seen â Give way men â whis-pered Star-buck draw-ing still fur-ther aft the sheet of his sail â there is time to kill a fish yet be-fore the squall comes Thereâ s white water again â close to Spring â Soon after two cries in quick suc-ces-sion on each side of us denot-ed that the other boats had got fast but hard-ly were they over-heard when with a light-ning like hurtling whis-per Star-buck said â Stand up â and Quee-queg har-poon in hand sprang to his feet Though not one of the oars-men was then fac-ing the life and death per-il so close to them ahead yet with their eyes on the in-tense coun-te-nance of the mate in the stern of the boat they knew that the im-mi-nent in-stant had come they heard too an enor-mous wal-low-ing sound as of fifty ele-phan-ts stir-ring in their lit-ter Mean-while the boat was still boom-ing through the mist the waves curl-ing and hiss-ing around us like the erect-ed crests of en-raged ser-pen-ts â Thatâ s his hump There there give it to him â whis-pered Star-buck A short rush-ing sound leaped out of the boat it was the dart-ed iron of Quee-queg Then all in one weld-ed com-mo-tion came an in-vis-i-ble push from astern while for-ward the boat seemed strik-ing on a ledge the sail col-lapsed and ex-plod-ed a gush of scald-ing va-por shot up near by some-thing rolled and tum-bled like an earthquake be-neath us The whole crew were half suf-fo-cat-ed as they were tossed hel-ter skel-ter in-to the white cur-dling cream of the squall Squall whale and har-poon had all blend-ed to-geth-er and the whale mere-ly grazed by the iron es-caped Though com-plete-ly swamped the boat was near-ly un-harmed Swim-ming round it we picked up the float-ing oars and lash-ing them across the gun-wale tum-bled back to our places There we sat up to our knees in the sea the water cover-ing every rib and plank so that to our down-ward gaz-ing eyes the sus-pend-ed craft seemed a co-ral boat grown up to us from the bot-tom of the ocean The wind in-creased to a howl the waves dashed their buck-lers to-geth-er the whole squall roared forked and crack-led around us like a white fire upon the prair-ie in which un-con-sumed we were burn-ing im-mor-tal in th-ese jaws of death In vain we hailed the other boats as well roar to the live coals down the chim-ney of a flam-ing fur-nace as hail those boats in that storm Mean-while the driv-ing scud rack and mist grew dark-er with the shad-ows of night no sign of the ship could be seen The ris-ing sea for-bade all at-temp-ts to bale out the boat The oars were use-less as pro-pellers per-form-ing now the of-fice of life pre-servers So cut-ting the lash-ing of the water-proof match keg after many fail-ures Star-buck con-trived to ig-nite the lamp in the lan-tern then stretch-ing it on a waif pole hand-ed it to Quee-queg as the stan-dard bearer of this for-lorn hope There then he sat hold-ing up that im-be-cile can-dle in the heart of that almighty for-lorn-ness There then he sat the sign and sym-bol of a man without faith hope-less-ly hold-ing up hope in the midst of de-s-pair Wet drenched through and shiver-ing cold de-s-pair-ing of ship or boat we lift-ed up our eyes as the dawn came on The mist still spread over the sea the emp-ty lan-tern lay crushed in the bot-tom of the boat Sud-den-ly Quee-queg start-ed to his feet hol-low-ing his hand to his ear We all heard a faint creak-ing as of ropes and yards hither-to muf-fled by the storm The sound came nearer and nearer the thick mists were dim-ly part-ed by a huge vague form Af-fright-ed we all sprang in-to the sea as the ship at last loomed in-to view bear-ing right down upon us within a dis-tance of not much more than its length Float-ing on the waves we saw the aban-doned boat as for one in-stant it tossed and gaped be-neath the shipâ s bows like a chip at the base of a cataract and then the vast hull rolled over it and it was seen no more till it came up wel-ter-ing astern Again we swam for it were dashed against it by the seas and were at last tak-en up and safe-ly land-ed on board Ere the squall came close to the other boats had cut loose from their fish and re-turned to the ship in good time The ship had giv-en us up but was still cruis-ing if haply it might light upon some to-ken of our per-ish-ing â an oar or a lance pole CHAPTER 49 The Hye-na There are cer-tain queer times and oc-ca-sions in this strange mixed af-fair we call life when a man takes this whole uni-verse for a vast prac-ti-cal joke though the wit there-of he but dim-ly dis-cerns and more than sus-pec-ts that the joke is at no-bodyâ s ex-pense but his own How-ev-er noth-ing dispir-its and noth-ing seems worth while dis-put-ing He bolts down all even-ts all creeds and beliefs and per-sua-sions all hard things vis-i-ble and in-vis-i-ble nev-er mind how knob-by as an ostrich of po-tent diges-tion gob-bles down bul-lets and gun flin-ts And as for small dif-fi-cul-ties and wor-ry-ings prospec-ts of sud-den disas-ter per-il of life and limb all th-ese and death it-self seem to him on-ly sly good na-tured hits and jol-ly punch-es in the side bestowed by the unseen and unac-count-able old jok-er That odd sort of way-ward mood I am speak-ing of comes over a man on-ly in some time of ex-treme tribu-la-tion it comes in the very midst of his earnest-ness so that what just be-fore might have seemed to him a thing most mo-men-tous now seems but a part of the gen-er-al joke There is noth-ing like the per-ils of whal-ing to breed this free and easy sort of ge-nial des-per-a-do phi-los-o-phy and with it I now re-gard-ed this whole voy-age of the Pe-quod and the great White Whale its ob-ject â Quee-queg â said I when they had dragged me the last man to the deck and I was still shak-ing my-self in my jack-et to fling off the water â Quee-queg my fine friend does this sort of thing often hap-pen â Without much emo-tion though soaked through just like me he gave me to un-der-stand that such things did often hap-pen â Mr Stubb â said I turn-ing to that wor-thy who but-toned up in his oil jack-et was now calm-ly smok-ing his pipe in the rain â Mr Stubb I think I have heard you say that of all whale-men you ever met our chief mate Mr Star-buck is by far the most care-ful and pru-dent I sup-pose then that go-ing plump on a fly-ing whale with your sail set in a fog-gy squall is the height of a whale-manâ s dis-cre-tion â â Cer-tain Iâ ve low-ered for whales from a leak-ing ship in a gale off Cape Horn â â Mr Flask â said I turn-ing to lit-tle King Post who was stand-ing close by â you are ex-pe-ri-enced in th-ese things and I am not Will you tell me whether it is an unal-ter-able law in this fish-ery Mr Flask for an oars-man to break his own back pulling him-self back fore-most in-to deathâ s jaws â â Canâ t you twist that smaller â said Flask â Yes thatâ s the law I should like to see a boatâ s crew back-ing water up to a whale face fore-most Ha ha the whale would give them squint for squint mind that â Here then from three im-par-tial wit-ness-es I had a de-lib-er-ate state-ment of the en-tire case Con-sid-er-ing there-fore that squal-ls and cap-siz-ings in the water and con-se-quent bivouacks on the deep were mat-ters of com-mon oc-cur-rence in this kind of life con-sid-er-ing that at the su-perla-tive-ly crit-i-cal in-stant of go-ing on to the whale I must re-sign my life in-to the hands of him who steered the boatâ of-ten-times a fel-low who at that very mo-ment is in his im-petu-ous-ness upon the point of scut-tling the craft with his own fran-tic stamp-ings con-sid-er-ing that the par-tic-u-lar disas-ter to our own par-tic-u-lar boat was chiefly to be im-put-ed to Star-buckâ s driv-ing on to his whale al-most in the teeth of a squall and con-sid-er-ing that Star-buck notwith-stand-ing was fa-mous for his great heed-ful-ness in the fish-ery con-sid-er-ing that I be-longed to this un-com-mon-ly pru-dent Star-buckâ s boat and fi-nal-ly con-sid-er-ing in what a devilâ s chase I was im-pli-cat-ed touch-ing the White Whale tak-ing all things to-geth-er I say I thought I might as well go below and make a rough draft of my will â Quee-queg â said I â come along you shall be my lawyer ex-ecu-tor and le-ga-tee â It may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinker-ing at their last wil-ls and tes-ta-men-ts but there are no peo-ple in the world more fond of that diver-sion This was the fourth time in my nau-ti-cal life that I had done the same thing After the cer-e-mo-ny was con-clud-ed upon the pre-sent oc-ca-sion I felt all the easi-er a stone was rolled away from my heart Be-sides all the days I should now live would be as good as the days that Lazarus lived after his res-ur-rec-tion a sup-ple-men-tary clean gain of so many months or weeks as the case might be I sur-vived my-self my death and buri-al were locked up in my ch-est I looked round me tran-quil-ly and con-tent-ed-ly like a qui-et ghost with a clean con-science sit-ting in-side the bars of a snug fam-i-ly vault Now then thought I un-con-scious-ly rolling up the sleeves of my frock here goes for a cool col-lect-ed dive at death and destruc-tion and the devil fetch the hind-most CHAPTER 5 Ahabâ s Boat and Crew Fedal-lah â Who would have thought it Flask â cried Stubb â if I had but one leg you would not catch me in a boat un-less maybe to stop the plug hole with my tim-ber toe Oh heâ s a won-der-ful old man â â I donâ t think it so strange after all on that ac-count â said Flask â If his leg were off at the hip now it would be a dif-fer-ent thing That would dis-able him but he has one knee and good part of the other left you know â â I donâ t know that my lit-tle man I nev-er yet saw him kneel â Among whale wise peo-ple it has often been ar-gued whether con-sid-er-ing the paramount im-por-tance of his life to the suc-cess of the voy-age it is right for a whal-ing cap-tain to jeop-ar-dize that life in the ac-tive per-ils of the chase So Tamer-laneâ s soldiers often ar-gued with tears in their eyes whether that in-valu-able life of his ought to be car-ried in-to the thick-est of the fight But with Ahab the ques-tion as-sumed a mod-i-fied aspect Con-sid-er-ing that with two legs man is but a hob-bling wight in all times of danger con-sid-er-ing that the pur-suit of whales is al-ways un-der great and ex-traor-di-nary dif-fi-cul-ties that every in-di-vid-u-al mo-ment in-deed then com-pris-es a per-il un-der th-ese cir-cum-stances is it wise for any maimed man to en-ter a whale boat in the hunt As a gen-er-al thing the joint own-ers of the Pe-quod must have plain-ly thought not Ahab well knew that although his friends at home would think lit-tle of his en-ter-ing a boat in cer-tain com-par-a-tive-ly harm-less vi-cis-si-tudes of the chase for the sake of be-ing near the scene of ac-tion and giv-ing his orders in per-son yet for Cap-tain Ahab to have a boat ac-tu-al-ly ap-por-tioned to him as a reg-u-lar heads-man in the hun-tâ above all for Cap-tain Ahab to be sup-plied with five ex-tra men as that same boatâ s crew he well knew that such gen-er-ous con-ceits nev-er en-tered the heads of the own-ers of the Pe-quod There-fore he had not solicit-ed a boatâ s crew from them nor had he in any way hint-ed his de-sires on that head Nev-er-the-less he had tak-en pri-vate mea-sures of his own touch-ing all that mat-ter Un-til Caba-coâ s pub-lished dis-cov-ery the sailors had lit-tle fore-seen it though to be sure when after be-ing a lit-tle while out of port all hands had con-clud-ed the cus-tom-ary busi-ness of fit-ting the whale-boats for ser-vice when some time after this Ahab was now and then found be-stir-ring him-self in the mat-ter of mak-ing thole pins with his own hands for what was thought to be one of the spare boats and even solic-i-tous-ly cut-ting the small wood-en skew-ers which when the line is run-ning out are pinned over the groove in the bow when all this was ob-served in him and par-tic-u-lar-ly his solic-i-tude in hav-ing an ex-tra coat of sheath-ing in the bot-tom of the boat as if to make it bet-ter with-stand the point-ed pres-sure of his ivory limb and al-so the anx-i-ety he evinced in ex-act-ly shap-ing the thigh board or clum-sy cleat as it is some-times called the hor-i-zon-tal piece in the boatâ s bow for brac-ing the knee against in dart-ing or stab-bing at the whale when it was ob-served how often he stood up in that boat with his soli-tary knee fixed in the se-mi cir-cu-lar de-pres-sion in the cleat and with the car-pen-terâ s chis-el gouged out a lit-tle here and straight-ened it a lit-tle there all th-ese things I say had awak-ened much in-ter-est and cu-rios-i-ty at the time But al-most every-body sup-posed that this par-tic-u-lar prepar-a-tive heed-ful-ness in Ahab must on-ly be with a view to the ul-ti-mate chase of Mo-by Dick for he had al-ready re-vealed his in-ten-tion to hunt that mor-tal mon-ster in per-son But such a sup-po-si-tion did by no means in-volve the re-motest sus-pi-cion as to any boatâ s crew be-ing as-signed to that boat Now with the subor-di-nate phan-toms what won-der re-mained soon waned away for in a whaler won-ders soon wane Be-sides now and then such unac-count-able od-ds and ends of strange na-tions come up from the un-known nooks and ash holes of the earth to man th-ese float-ing out-laws of whalers and the ships them-selves often pick up such queer cast-away crea-tures found toss-ing about the open sea on planks bits of wreck oars whale-boats ca-noes blown off Ja-panese junks and what not that Beelze-bub him-self might climb up the side and step down in-to the cabin to chat with the cap-tain and it would not create any un-sub-du-able ex-cite-ment in the fore-cas-tle But be all this as it may cer-tain it is that while the subor-di-nate phan-toms soon found their place among the crew though still as it were some-how distinct from them yet that hair tur-baned Fedal-lah re-mained a muf-fled mys-tery to the last Whence he came in a man-ner-ly world like this by what sort of unac-count-able tie he soon evinced him-self to be linked with Ahabâ s pe-cu-liar for-tunes nay so far as to have some sort of a half hint-ed in-flu-ence Heav-en knows but it might have been even author-i-ty over him all this none knew But one can-not sus-tain an in-dif-fer-ent air con-cern-ing Fedal-lah He was such a crea-ture as civ-i-lized do-mes-tic peo-ple in the tem-per-ate zone on-ly see in their dreams and that but dim-ly but the like of whom now and then glide among the un-chang-ing Asi-at-ic com-mu-ni-ties espe-cial-ly the Ori-en-tal isles to the east of the con-ti-nen-tâ those in-su-lat-ed im-memo-ri-al unal-ter-able coun-tries which even in th-ese modern days still pre-serve much of the ghost-ly abo-rig-i-nal-ness of earthâ s pri-mal gen-er-a-tions when the me-mory of the first man was a distinct recol-lec-tion and all men his descen-dan-ts un-know-ing whence he came eyed each other as real phan-toms and asked of the sun and the moon why they were creat-ed and to what end when though ac-cord-ing to Ge-n-e-sis the an-gels in-deed con-sort-ed with the daugh-ters of men the devils al-so add the un-canon-i-cal Rab-bins in-dulged in mun-dane amours CHAPTER 51 The Spir-it Spout Days weeks passed and un-der easy sail the ivory Pe-quod had slow-ly swept across four sev-er-al cruis-ing grounds that off the Azores off the Cape de Verdes on the Plate so called be-ing off the mouth of the Rio de la Pla-ta and the Car-rol Ground an un-staked watery lo-cal-i-ty souther-ly from St He-le-na It was while glid-ing through th-ese lat-ter waters that one serene and moon-light night when all the waves rolled by like scrol-ls of sil-ver and by their soft suf-fus-ing seethings made what seemed a sil-very si-lence not a soli-tude on such a si-lent night a sil-very jet was seen far in ad-vance of the white bub-bles at the bow Lit up by the moon it looked ce-les-tial seemed some plumed and glit-ter-ing god upris-ing from the sea Fedal-lah first de-scried this jet For of th-ese moon-light nights it was his wont to mount to the main mast head and stand a look out there with the same pre-ci-sion as if it had been day And yet though herds of whales were seen by night not one whale-man in a hun-dred would ven-ture a low-er-ing for them You may think with what emo-tions then the sea-men be-held this old Ori-en-tal perched aloft at such unusu-al hours his tur-ban and the moon com-pan-ions in one sky But when after spend-ing his uni-form in-ter-val there for sev-er-al suc-ces-sive nights without ut-ter-ing a sin-gle sound when after all this si-lence his un-earth-ly voice was heard an-nounc-ing that sil-very moon lit jet every re-clin-ing mariner start-ed to his feet as if some winged spir-it had light-ed in the rig-ging and hailed the mor-tal crew â There she blows â Had the trump of judg-ment blown they could not have quiv-ered more yet still they felt no ter-ror rather plea-sure For though it was a most un-wont-ed hour yet so im-pres-sive was the cry and so deliri-ous-ly ex-cit-ing that al-most every soul on board in-stinc-tive-ly de-sired a low-er-ing Walk-ing the deck with quick side lung-ing strides Ahab com-mand-ed the tâ gal-lant sails and roy-als to be set and every stun-sail spread The best man in the ship must take the helm Then with every mast head manned the piled up craft rolled down be-fore the wind The strange upheav-ing lift-ing ten-den-cy of the taf-frail breeze filling the hol-lows of so many sails made the buoy-ant hover-ing deck to feel like air be-neath the feet while still she rushed along as if two an-tag-o-nis-tic in-flu-ences were strug-gling in herâ one to mount direct to heav-en the other to drive yaw-ing-ly to some hor-i-zon-tal goal And had you watched Ahabâ s face that night you would have thought that in him al-so two dif-fer-ent things were war-ring While his one live leg made live-ly echoes along the deck every stroke of his dead limb sound-ed like a cof-fin tap On life and death this old man walked But though the ship so swift-ly sped and though from every eye like ar-rows the eager glances shot yet the sil-very jet was no more seen that night Every sailor swore he saw it once but not a se-cond time This mid-night spout had al-most grown a for-got-ten thing when some days after lo at the same si-lent hour it was again an-nounced again it was de-scried by all but upon mak-ing sail to over-take it once more it dis-ap-peared as if it had nev-er been And so it served us night after night till no one heed-ed it but to won-der at it Mys-te-ri-ous-ly jet-ted in-to the clear moon-light or starlight as the case might be dis-ap-pear-ing again for one whole day or two days or three and some-how seem-ing at every distinct rep-e-ti-tion to be ad-vanc-ing still fur-ther and fur-ther in our van this soli-tary jet seemed for ever al-lur-ing us on Nor with the im-memo-ri-al su-per-sti-tion of their race and in ac-cor-dance with the preter-nat-u-ral-ness as it seemed which in many things in-vest-ed the Pe-quod were there want-ing some of the sea-men who swore that when-ev-er and wher-ev-er de-scried at how-ev-er re-mote times or in how-ev-er far apart lat-i-tudes and lon-gi-tudes that un-n-ear-able spout was cast by one self same whale and that whale Mo-by Dick For a time there reigned too a sense of pe-cu-liar dread at this flit-ting ap-pari-tion as if it were treach-er-ous-ly beck-on-ing us on and on in order that the mon-ster might turn round upon us and rend us at last in the re-motest and most sav-age seas Th-ese tem-po-rary ap-pre-hen-sions so vague but so aw-ful derived a won-drous po-ten-cy from the con-trast-ing seren-i-ty of the weather in which be-neath all its blue bland-ness some thought there lurked a devil-ish charm as for days and days we voy-aged along through seas so weari-ly lone-some-ly mild that all space in repug-nance to our venge-ful er-rand seemed va-cat-ing it-self of life be-fore our urn like prow But at last when turn-ing to the east-ward the Cape winds be-gan howl-ing around us and we rose and fell upon the long trou-bled seas that are there when the ivory tusked Pe-quod sharply bowed to the blast and gored the dark waves in her mad-ness till like show-ers of sil-ver chips the foam flakes flew over her bul-warks then all this deso-late vacu-ity of life went away but gave place to sights more dis-mal than be-fore Close to our bows strange for-ms in the water dart-ed hither and thith-er be-fore us while thick in our rear flew the in-scrutable sea ravens And every morn-ing perched on our stays rows of th-ese birds were seen and spite of our hoot-ings for a long time ob-sti-nate-ly clung to the hemp as though they deemed our ship some drift-ing un-in-hab-it-ed craft a thing ap-point-ed to deso-la-tion and there-fore fit roost-ing place for their home-less selves And heaved and heaved still un-rest-ing-ly heaved the black sea as if its vast tides were a con-science and the great mun-dane soul were in an-guish and re-morse for the long sin and suf-fer-ing it had bred Cape of Good Hope do they call ye Rather Cape Tor-men-toso as called of yore for long al-lured by the per-fid-i-ous si-lences that be-fore had at-tend-ed us we found our-selves launched in-to this tor-ment-ed sea where guilty be-ings trans-formed in-to those fowls and th-ese fish seemed con-demned to swim on ever-last-ing-ly without any haven in store or beat that black air without any hori-zon But calm snow white and un-vary-ing still direct-ing its foun-tain of feathers to the sky still beck-on-ing us on from be-fore the soli-tary jet would at times be de-scried Dur-ing all this black-ness of the ele-men-ts Ahab though as-sum-ing for the time the al-most con-tin-u-al com-mand of the drenched and danger-ous deck man-i-fest-ed the gloomi-est re-serve and more sel-dom than ever ad-dressed his mates In tem-pes-tu-ous times like th-ese after every-thing above and aloft has been se-cured noth-ing more can be done but pas-sive-ly to await the is-sue of the gale Then Cap-tain and crew be-come prac-ti-cal fatal-ists So with his ivory leg insert-ed in-to its ac-cus-tomed hole and with one hand firm-ly grasp-ing a shroud Ahab for hours and hours would stand gaz-ing dead to wind-ward while an oc-ca-sion-al squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal his very eye-lash-es to-geth-er Mean-time the crew driv-en from the for-ward part of the ship by the per-ilous seas that burst-ing-ly broke over its bows stood in a line along the bul-warks in the waist and the bet-ter to guard against the leap-ing waves each man had slipped him-self in-to a sort of bow-line se-cured to the rail in which he swung as in a loos-ened belt Few or no words were spo-ken and the si-lent ship as if manned by paint-ed sailors in wax day after day tore on through all the swift mad-ness and glad-ness of the de-mo-ni-ac waves By night the same mute-ness of hu-man-i-ty be-fore the shrieks of the ocean pre-vailed still in si-lence the men swung in the bow-lines still word-less Ahab stood up to the blast Even when wearied na-ture seemed de-mand-ing re-pose he would not seek that re-pose in his ham-mock Nev-er could Star-buck for-get the old manâ s aspect when one night go-ing down in-to the cabin to mark how the barom-e-ter stood he saw him with closed eyes sit-ting straight in his floor screwed chair the rain and half melt-ed sleet of the storm from which he had some time be-fore emerged still slow-ly drip-ping from the un-re-moved hat and coat On the table be-side him lay un-rolled one of those charts of tides and cur-ren-ts which have pre-vi-ous-ly been spo-ken of His lan-tern swung from his tight-ly clenched hand Though the body was erect the head was thrown back so that the closed eyes were point-ed towards the nee-dle of the tell tale that swung from a beam in the ceil-ing The cabin com-pass is called the tell tale be-cause without go-ing to the com-pass at the helm the Cap-tain while below can in-form him-self of the course of the ship Ter-ri-ble old man thought Star-buck with a shud-der sleep-ing in this gale still thou stead-fast-ly eyest thy pur-pose CHAPTER 52 The Al-ba-tross South east-ward from the Cape off the dis-tant Crozetts a good cruis-ing ground for Right Whale-men a sail loomed ahead the Goney Al-ba-tross by name As she slow-ly drew nigh from my lofty perch at the fore mast head I had a good view of that sight so re-mark-able to a ty-ro in the far ocean fish-eriesâ a whaler at sea and long ab-sent from home As if the waves had been fullers this craft was bleached like the skele-ton of a strand-ed wal-rus All down her sides this spec-tral ap-pear-ance was traced with long chan-nels of red-dened rust while all her spars and her rig-ging were like the thick branch-es of trees furred over with hoar frost On-ly her low-er sails were set A wild sight it was to see her long beard-ed look outs at those three mast heads They seemed clad in the skins of beasts so torn and bepatched the rai-ment that had sur-vived near-ly four years of cruis-ing Stand-ing in iron hoops nailed to the mast they swayed and swung over a fath-om-less sea and though when the ship slow-ly glid-ed close un-der our stern we six men in the air came so nigh to each other that we might al-most have leaped from the mast heads of one ship to those of the other yet those for-lorn look-ing fish-er-men mild-ly eye-ing us as they passed said not one word to our own look outs while the quar-ter deck hail was be-ing heard from below â Ship ahoy Have ye seen the White Whale â But as the strange cap-tain lean-ing over the pal-lid bul-warks was in the act of put-ting his trum-pet to his mouth it some-how fell from his hand in-to the sea and the wind now ris-ing amain he in vain strove to make him-self heard without it Mean-time his ship was still in-creas-ing the dis-tance between While in var-i-ous si-lent ways the sea-men of the Pe-quod were evinc-ing their ob-ser-vance of this omi-nous in-ci-dent at the first mere men-tion of the White Whaleâ s name to another ship Ahab for a mo-ment paused it al-most seemed as though he would have low-ered a boat to board the stranger had not the threat-en-ing wind for-bade But tak-ing ad-van-tage of his wind-ward po-si-tion he again seized his trum-pet and know-ing by her aspect that the stranger ves-sel was a Nan-tuck-eter and short-ly bound home he loud-ly hailedâ â Ahoy there This is the Pe-quod bound round the world Tell them to ad-dress all fu-ture let-ters to the Pa-cif-ic ocean and this time three years if I am not at home tell them to ad-dress them to â â â At that mo-ment the two wakes were fair-ly crossed and in-stant-ly then in ac-cor-dance with their sin-gu-lar ways shoals of small harm-less fish that for some days be-fore had been placid-ly swim-ming by our side dart-ed away with what seemed shud-der-ing fins and ranged them-selves fore and aft with the strangerâ s flanks Though in the course of his con-tin-u-al voy-ag-ings Ahab must often be-fore have no-ticed a sim-i-lar sight yet to any mono-ma-ni-ac man the veri-est tri-fles capri-cious-ly car-ry mean-ings â Swim away from me do ye â mur-mured Ahab gaz-ing over in-to the water There seemed but lit-tle in the words but the tone con-veyed more of deep help-less sad-ness than the in-sane old man had ever be-fore evinced But turn-ing to the steers-man who thus far had been hold-ing the ship in the wind to di-min-ish her head-way he cried out in his old lion voice â â Up helm Keep her off round the world â Round the world There is much in that sound to in-spire proud feel-ings but where-to does all that cir-cum-nav-i-ga-tion con-duct On-ly through num-ber-less per-ils to the very point whence we start-ed where those that we left be-hind se-cure were all the time be-fore us Were this world an end-less plain and by sail-ing east-ward we could for ever reach new dis-tances and dis-cov-er sights more sweet and strange than any Cy-clades or Is-lands of King Solomon then there were promise in the voy-age But in pur-suit of those far mys-ter-ies we dream of or in tor-ment-ed chase of that de-mon phan-tom that some time or other swims be-fore all hu-man hearts while chas-ing such over this round globe they either lead us on in bar-ren mazes or mid-way leave us whelmed CHAPTER 53 The Gam The osten-si-ble rea-son why Ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had spo-ken was this the wind and sea be-to-kened stor-ms But even had this not been the case he would not after all per-haps have board-ed herâ judg-ing by his sub-se-quent con-duct on sim-i-lar oc-ca-sion-sâ if so it had been that by the pro-cess of hail-ing he had ob-tained a nega-tive an-swer to the ques-tion he put For as it even-tu-al-ly turned out he cared not to con-sort even for five min-utes with any stranger cap-tain ex-cept he could con-tribute some of that in-for-ma-tion he so ab-sorbing-ly sought But all this might re-main inad-e-quate-ly es-ti-mat-ed were not some-thing said here of the pe-cu-liar usages of whal-ing ves-sels when meet-ing each other in for-eign seas and espe-cial-ly on a com-mon cruis-ing ground If two strangers cross-ing the Pine Bar-rens in New York State or the equal-ly deso-late Sal-is-bury Plain in Eng-land if ca-su-al-ly en-coun-ter-ing each other in such in-hos-pitable wilds th-ese twain for the life of them can-not well avoid a mu-tu-al sa-lu-ta-tion and stop-ping for a mo-ment to in-ter-change the news and per-haps sit-ting down for a while and rest-ing in con-cert then how much more nat-u-ral that upon the il-lim-itable Pine Bar-rens and Sal-is-bury Plains of the sea two whal-ing ves-sels de-scry-ing each other at the ends of the earthâ off lone Fan-ningâ s Is-land or the far away Kingâ s Mil-ls how much more nat-u-ral I say that un-der such cir-cum-stances th-ese ships should not on-ly in-ter-change hails but come in-to still clos-er more friend-ly and so-cia-ble con-tact And espe-cial-ly would this seem to be a mat-ter of course in the case of ves-sels owned in one sea-port and whose cap-tains of-fi-cers and not a few of the men are per-son-al-ly known to each other and con-se-quent-ly have all sorts of dear do-mes-tic things to talk about For the long ab-sent ship the out-ward bounder per-haps has let-ters on board at any rate she will be sure to let her have some papers of a date a year or two later than the last one on her blurred and thumb worn files And in re-turn for that cour-tesy the out-ward bound ship would re-ceive the lat-est whal-ing in-tel-li-gence from the cruis-ing ground to which she may be destined a thing of the ut-most im-por-tance to her And in de-gree all this will hold true con-cern-ing whal-ing ves-sels cross-ing each otherâ s track on the cruis-ing ground it-self even though they are equal-ly long ab-sent from home For one of them may have re-ceived a trans-fer of let-ters from some third and now far re-mote ves-sel and some of those let-ters may be for the peo-ple of the ship she now meets Be-sides they would ex-change the whal-ing news and have an agree-able chat For not on-ly would they meet with all the sym-pa-thies of sailors but like-wise with all the pe-cu-liar con-ge-nial-i-ties aris-ing from a com-mon pur-suit and mu-tu-al-ly shared pri-va-tions and per-ils Nor would dif-fer-ence of coun-try make any very essen-tial dif-fer-ence that is so long as both par-ties speak one lan-guage as is the case with Amer-i-cans and English Though to be sure from the small num-ber of English whalers such meet-ings do not very often oc-cur and when they do oc-cur there is too apt to be a sort of shy-ness between them for your English-man is rather re-served and your Yan-kee he does not fan-cy that sort of thing in any-body but him-self Be-sides the English whalers some-times af-fect a kind of metropoli-tan su-pe-ri-or-i-ty over the Amer-i-can whalers re-gard-ing the long lean Nan-tuck-eter with his non-de-script provin-cialis-ms as a sort of sea peas-ant But where this su-pe-ri-or-i-ty in the English whale-men does real-ly con-sist it would be hard to say see-ing that the Yan-kees in one day col-lec-tive-ly kill more whales than all the English col-lec-tive-ly in ten years But this is a harm-less lit-tle foible in the English whale hun-ters which the Nan-tuck-eter does not take much to heart prob-a-bly be-cause he knows that he has a few foibles him-self So then we see that of all ships separate-ly sail-ing the sea the whalers have most rea-son to be so-cia-bleâ and they are so Where-as some mer-chant ships cross-ing each otherâ s wake in the mid At-lantic will of-ten-times pass on without so much as a sin-gle word of recog-ni-tion mu-tu-al-ly cut-ting each other on the high seas like a brace of dandies in Broad-way and all the time in-dulging per-haps in fini-cal crit-i-cism upon each otherâ s rig As for Men of War when they chance to meet at sea they first go through such a string of sil-ly bow-ings and scrap-ings such a duck-ing of en-signs that there does not seem to be much right down hearty good will and brother-ly love about it at all As touch-ing Slave ships meet-ing why they are in such a prodi-gious hur-ry they run away from each other as soon as pos-si-ble And as for Pi-rates when they chance to cross each otherâ s cross bones the first hail isâ â How many skul-ls â â the same way that whalers hailâ â How many bar-rels â And that ques-tion once an-swered pi-rates straight-way steer apart for they are in-fer-nal vil-lains on both sides and donâ t like to see over-much of each otherâ s vil-lanous like-ness-es But look at the god-ly hon-est unos-ten-ta-tious hospitable so-cia-ble free and easy whaler What does the whaler do when she meets another whaler in any sort of de-cent weather She has a â Gam â a thing so ut-ter-ly un-known to all other ships that they nev-er heard of the name even and if by chance they should hear of it they on-ly grin at it and re-peat game-some stuff about â spouter-sâ and â blub-ber boil-ers â and such like pret-ty ex-cla-ma-tions Why it is that all Mer-chant sea-men and al-so all Pi-rates and Man of Warâ s men and Slave ship sailors cher-ish such a scorn-ful feel-ing towards Whale ships this is a ques-tion it would be hard to an-swer Be-cause in the case of pi-rates say I should like to know whether that pro-fes-sion of theirs has any pe-cu-liar glo-ry about it It some-times ends in un-com-mon el-e-va-tion in-deed but on-ly at the gal-lows And be-sides when a man is el-e-vat-ed in that odd fash-ion he has no prop-er foun-da-tion for his su-pe-ri-or alti-tude Hence I con-clude that in boast-ing him-self to be high lift-ed above a whale-man in that asser-tion the pi-rate has no sol-id ba-sis to stand on But what is a Gam You might wear out your in-dex finger run-ning up and down the colum-ns of dic-tionar-ies and nev-er find the word Dr John-son nev-er at-tained to that eru-di-tion Noah Web-sterâ s ark does not hold it Nev-er-the-less this same ex-pres-sive word has now for many years been in con-stant use among some fif-teen thou-sand true born Yan-kees Cer-tain-ly it needs a def-i-ni-tion and should be in-cor-po-rat-ed in-to the Lex-i-con With that view let me learned-ly de-fine it GAM NOUNâ A so-cial meet-ing of two or more Whale-ships gen-er-al-ly on a cruis-ing ground when after ex-chang-ing hails they ex-change visits by boat-sâ crews the two cap-tains re-main-ing for the time on board of one ship and the two chief mates on the other There is another lit-tle item about Gam-ming which must not be for-got-ten here All pro-fes-sions have their own lit-tle pe-cu-liar-i-ties of de-tail so has the whale fish-ery In a pi-rate man of war or slave ship when the cap-tain is rowed any-where in his boat he al-ways sits in the stern sheets on a com-fort-able some-times cush-ioned seat there and often steers him-self with a pret-ty lit-tle millinerâ s tiller dec-o-rat-ed with gay cords and rib-bons But the whale boat has no seat astern no so-fa of that sort what-ev-er and no tiller at all High times in-deed if whal-ing cap-tains were wheeled about the water on cas-tors like gouty old al-der-men in pa-tent chairs And as for a tiller the whale boat nev-er ad-mits of any such ef-fem-i-na-cy and there-fore as in gam-ming a com-plete boatâ s crew must leave the ship and hence as the boat steerer or har-pooneer is of the num-ber that subor-di-nate is the steers-man upon the oc-ca-sion and the cap-tain hav-ing no place to sit in is pulled off to his visit all stand-ing like a pine tree And often you will no-tice that be-ing con-scious of the eyes of the whole vis-i-ble world rest-ing on him from the sides of the two ships this stand-ing cap-tain is all alive to the im-por-tance of sus-tain-ing his dig-ni-ty by main-tain-ing his legs Nor is this any very easy mat-ter for in his rear is the im-mense pro-ject-ing steer-ing oar hit-ting him now and then in the small of his back the after oar re-cip-ro-cat-ing by rap-ping his knees in front He is thus com-plete-ly wedged be-fore and be-hind and can on-ly ex-pand him-self side-ways by set-tling down on his stretched legs but a sud-den vi-o-lent pitch of the boat will often go far to top-ple him be-cause length of foun-da-tion is noth-ing without cor-re-spond-ing breadth Mere-ly make a spread an-gle of two poles and you can-not stand them up Then again it would nev-er do in plain sight of the worldâ s rivet-ed eyes it would nev-er do I say for this strad-dling cap-tain to be seen steady-ing him-self the slight-est par-ti-cle by catch-ing hold of any-thing with his hands in-deed as to-ken of his en-tire buoy-ant self com-mand he gen-er-al-ly car-ries his hands in his trowser-sâ pock-ets but per-haps be-ing gen-er-al-ly very large heavy hands he car-ries them there for bal-last Nev-er-the-less there have oc-curred in-stances well authen-ti-cat-ed ones too where the cap-tain has been known for an un-com-mon-ly crit-i-cal mo-ment or two in a sud-den squall sayâ to seize hold of the near-est oars-manâ s hair and hold on there like grim death CHAPTER 54 The Town Hoâ s Sto-ry As told at the Gold-en Inn The Cape of Good Hope and all the watery re-gion round about there is much like some not-ed four corners of a great high-way where you meet more trav-ellers than in any other part It was not very long after speak-ing the Goney that another home-ward bound whale-man the Town Ho was en-coun-tered She was manned al-most whol-ly by Poly-ne-sians In the short gam that en-sued she gave us strong news of Mo-by Dick To some the gen-er-al in-ter-est in the White Whale was now wild-ly height-ened by a cir-cum-stance of the Town Hoâ s sto-ry which seemed ob-scure-ly to in-volve with the whale a cer-tain won-drous in-vert-ed visi-ta-tion of one of those so called judg-men-ts of God which at times are said to over-take some men This lat-ter cir-cum-stance with its own par-tic-u-lar ac-com-pa-ni-men-ts form-ing what may be called the se-cret part of the tragedy about to be nar-rat-ed nev-er reached the ears of Cap-tain Ahab or his mates For that se-cret part of the sto-ry was un-known to the cap-tain of the Town Ho him-self It was the pri-vate prop-er-ty of three con-fed-er-ate white sea-men of that ship one of whom it seems com-mu-ni-cat-ed it to Tashtego with Romish in-junc-tions of se-cre-cy but the fol-low-ing night Tashtego ram-bled in his sleep and re-vealed so much of it in that way that when he was wak-ened he could not well with-hold the rest Nev-er-the-less so po-tent an in-flu-ence did this thing have on those sea-men in the Pe-quod who came to the full knowl-edge of it and by such a strange del-i-ca-cy to call it so were they governed in this mat-ter that they kept the se-cret among them-selves so that it nev-er tran-spired abaft the Pe-quodâ s main mast In-ter-weav-ing in its prop-er place this dark-er thread with the sto-ry as publicly nar-rat-ed on the ship the whole of this strange af-fair I now pro-ceed to put on last-ing record The an-cient whale cry upon first sight-ing a whale from the mast head still used by whale-men in hunt-ing the fa-mous Gal-li-pa-gos ter-rapin For my hu-morâ s sake I shall pre-serve the style in which I once nar-rat-ed it at Li-ma to a loung-ing cir-cle of my Span-ish friends one sain-tâ s eve smok-ing upon the thick gilt tiled pi-az-za of the Gold-en Inn Of those fine cava-liers the young Dons Pe-dro and Se-bas-tian were on the clos-er ter-ms with me and hence the in-ter-lud-ing ques-tions they oc-ca-sion-al-ly put and which are du-ly an-swered at the time â Some two years pri-or to my first learn-ing the even-ts which I am about re-hears-ing to you gentle-men the Town Ho Sperm Whaler of Nan-tuck-et was cruis-ing in your Pa-cif-ic here not very many daysâ sail east-ward from the eaves of this good Gold-en Inn She was some-where to the north-ward of the Line One morn-ing upon han-dling the pumps ac-cord-ing to dai-ly usage it was ob-served that she made more water in her hold than com-mon They sup-posed a sword fish had stabbed her gentle-men But the cap-tain hav-ing some unusu-al rea-son for believ-ing that rare good luck await-ed him in those lat-i-tudes and there-fore be-ing very averse to quit them and the leak not be-ing then con-sid-ered at all danger-ous though in-deed they could not find it after search-ing the hold as low down as was pos-si-ble in rather heavy weather the ship still con-tin-ued her cruis-ings the mariners work-ing at the pumps at wide and easy in-ter-vals but no good luck came more days went by and not on-ly was the leak yet undis-cov-ered but it sen-si-bly in-creased So much so that now tak-ing some alarm the cap-tain mak-ing all sail stood away for the near-est har-bor among the is-lands there to have his hull hove out and re-paired â Though no small pas-sage was be-fore her yet if the com-mon-est chance favoured he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the way be-cause his pumps were of the best and be-ing pe-ri-od-i-cal-ly relieved at them those six and thir-ty men of his could easi-ly keep the ship free nev-er mind if the leak should dou-ble on her In truth well nigh the whole of this pas-sage be-ing at-tend-ed by very pros-per-ous breezes the Town Ho had all but cer-tain-ly ar-rived in per-fect safe-ty at her port without the oc-cur-rence of the least fatal-i-ty had it not been for the bru-tal over-bear-ing of Rad-ney the mate a Vine-yarder and the bit-ter-ly pro-voked vengeance of Steelk-ilt a Lake-man and des-per-a-do from Buf-fa-lo â â Lake-man â Buf-fa-lo Pray what is a Lake-man and where is Buf-fa-lo â said Don Se-bas-tian ris-ing in his swing-ing mat of grass â On the eastern shore of our Lake Erie Don butâ I crave your cour-tesyâ may be you shall soon hear fur-ther of all that Now gentle-men in square sail brigs and three mast-ed ships well nigh as large and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old Cal-lao to far Manil-la this Lake-man in the land locked heart of our Amer-i-ca had yet been nur-tured by all those agrar-i-an free-boot-ing im-pres-sions pop-u-lar-ly con-nect-ed with the open ocean For in their in-ter-flow-ing ag-gre-gate those grand fresh water seas of ours â Erie and On-tario and Huron and Su-pe-ri-or and Michi-gan â possess an ocean like ex-pan-sive-ness with many of the oceanâ s noblest traits with many of its rimmed va-ri-eties of races and of climes They con-tain round archipela-goes of ro-man-tic isles even as the Poly-ne-sian waters do in large part are shored by two great con-trast-ing na-tions as the At-lantic is they fur-nish long mar-itime ap-proach-es to our numer-ous ter-ri-to-ri-al colonies from the East dot-ted all round their banks here and there are frowned upon by bat-ter-ies and by the goat like crag-gy guns of lofty Mack-i-naw they have heard the fleet thun-der-ings of naval vic-to-ries at in-ter-vals they yield their beach-es to wild bar-bar-ians whose red paint-ed faces flash from out their pel-try wig-wams for leagues and leagues are flanked by an-cient and unen-tered forests where the gaunt pines stand like ser-ried lines of kings in Goth-ic ge-nealo-gies those same woods har-bor-ing wild Afric beasts of prey and silken crea-tures whose ex-port-ed furs give robes to Tar-tar Em-per-ors they mir-ror the paved cap-i-tals of Buf-fa-lo and Cleve-land as well as Win-neba-go vil-lages they float alike the full rigged mer-chant ship the armed cruis-er of the State the steam-er and the beech ca-noe they are swept by Bore-an and dis-mast-ing blasts as dire-ful as any that lash the salt-ed wave they know what ship-wrecks are for out of sight of land how-ev-er in-land they have drowned full many a mid-night ship with all its shriek-ing crew Thus gentle-men though an in-lan-der Steelk-ilt was wild ocean born and wild ocean nur-tured as much of an au-da-cious mariner as any And for Rad-ney though in his in-fan-cy he may have laid him down on the lone Nan-tuck-et beach to nurse at his ma-ter-nal sea though in after life he had long fol-lowed our aus-tere At-lantic and your con-tem-pla-tive Pa-cif-ic yet was he quite as venge-ful and full of so-cial quar-rel as the back-woods sea-man fresh from the lat-i-tudes of buck horn han-dled Bow-ie knives Yet was this Nan-tuck-eter a man with some good heart-ed traits and this Lake-man a mariner who though a sort of devil in-deed might yet by in-flex-i-ble firm-ness on-ly tem-pered by that com-mon de-cen-cy of hu-man recog-ni-tion which is the mean-est slaveâ s right thus treat-ed this Steelk-ilt had long been re-tained harm-less and docile At all even-ts he had proved so thus far but Rad-ney was doomed and made mad and Steelk-iltâ but gentle-men you shall hear â It was not more than a day or two at the fur-thest after point-ing her prow for her is-land haven that the Town Hoâ s leak seemed again in-creas-ing but on-ly so as to re-quire an hour or more at the pumps every day You must know that in a set-tled and civ-i-lized ocean like our At-lantic for ex-am-ple some skip-pers think lit-tle of pump-ing their whole way across it though of a still sleepy night should the of-fi-cer of the deck hap-pen to for-get his du-ty in that re-spect the prob-a-bil-i-ty would be that he and his ship-mates would nev-er again re-mem-ber it on ac-count of all hands gent-ly sub-sid-ing to the bot-tom Nor in the soli-tary and sav-age seas far from you to the west-ward gentle-men is it al-to-geth-er unusu-al for ships to keep clang-ing at their pump han-dles in full cho-rus even for a voy-age of con-sid-er-able length that is if it lie along a tol-er-a-bly ac-ces-si-ble coast or if any other rea-son-able re-treat is af-ford-ed them It is on-ly when a leaky ves-sel is in some very out of the way part of those waters some real-ly land-less lat-i-tude that her cap-tain be-gins to feel a lit-tle anx-ious â Much this way had it been with the Town Ho so when her leak was found gain-ing once more there was in truth some small con-cern man-i-fest-ed by sev-er-al of her com-pa-ny espe-cial-ly by Rad-ney the mate He com-mand-ed the up-per sails to be well hoist-ed sheet-ed home anew and every way ex-pand-ed to the breeze Now this Rad-ney I sup-pose was as lit-tle of a coward and as lit-tle in-clined to any sort of ner-vous ap-pre-hen-sive-ness touch-ing his own per-son as any fear-less un-think-ing crea-ture on land or on sea that you can con-ve-nient-ly imag-ine gentle-men There-fore when he be-trayed this solic-i-tude about the safe-ty of the ship some of the sea-men de-clared that it was on-ly on ac-count of his be-ing a part own-er in her So when they were work-ing that even-ing at the pumps there was on this head no small game-some-ness slily go-ing on among them as they stood with their feet con-tin-u-al-ly over-flowed by the rip-pling clear water clear as any moun-tain spring gentle-menâ that bub-bling from the pumps ran across the deck and poured it-self out in steady spouts at the lee scup-per holes â Now as you well know it is not sel-dom the case in this con-ven-tion-al world of oursâ watery or other-wise that when a per-son placed in com-mand over his fel-low men finds one of them to be very sig-nif-i-cant-ly his su-pe-ri-or in gen-er-al pride of man-hood straight-way against that man he con-ceives an un-con-quer-able dis-like and bit-ter-ness and if he have a chance he will pull down and pul-ver-ize that subal-ternâ s tow-er and make a lit-tle heap of dust of it Be this con-ceit of mine as it may gentle-men at all even-ts Steelk-ilt was a tall and noble an-i-mal with a head like a Ro-man and a flow-ing gold-en beard like the tas-seled hous-ings of your last viceroyâ s snort-ing charg-er and a brain and a heart and a soul in him gentle-men which had made Steelk-ilt Charle-magne had he been born son to Charle-mag-neâ s father But Rad-ney the mate was ug-ly as a mule yet as hardy as stub-born as ma-li-cious He did not love Steelk-ilt and Steelk-ilt knew it â Espy-ing the mate draw-ing near as he was toil-ing at the pump with the rest the Lake-man af-fect-ed not to no-tice him but unawed went on with his gay ban-ter-ings â â Aye aye my mer-ry lads itâ s a live-ly leak this hold a can-nikin one of ye and letâ s have a taste By the Lord itâ s worth bot-tling I tell ye what men old Radâ s in-vest-ment must go for it he had best cut away his part of the hull and tow it home The fact is boys that sword fish on-ly be-gan the job heâ s come back again with a gang of ship car-pen-ters saw fish and file fish and what not and the whole posse of â em are now hard at work cut-ting and slash-ing at the bot-tom mak-ing im-prove-men-ts I sup-pose If old Rad were here now Iâ d tell him to jump over-board and scat-ter â em Theyâ re play-ing the devil with his es-tate I can tell him But heâ s a sim-ple old soul â Rad and a beau-ty too Boys they say the rest of his prop-er-ty is in-vest-ed in look-ing glass-es I won-der if heâ d give a poor devil like me the model of his nose â â â Damn your eyes whatâ s that pump stop-ping for â roared Rad-ney pre-tend-ing not to have heard the sailorsâ talk â Thun-der away at it â â â Aye aye sir â said Steelk-ilt mer-ry as a crick-et â Live-ly boys live-ly now â And with that the pump clanged like fifty fire engines the men tossed their hats off to it and ere long that pe-cu-liar gasp-ing of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest ten-sion of lifeâ s ut-most en-er-gies â Quit-ting the pump at last with the rest of his band the Lake-man went for-ward all pant-ing and sat him-self down on the wind-lass his face fiery red his eyes blood-shot and wip-ing the pro-fuse sweat from his brow Now what cozen-ing fiend it was gentle-men that possessed Rad-ney to med-dle with such a man in that cor-po-re-al-ly ex-as-per-at-ed state I know not but so it hap-pened In-tol-er-a-bly strid-ing along the deck the mate com-mand-ed him to get a broom and sweep down the planks and al-so a shov-el and re-move some of-fen-sive mat-ters con-se-quent upon al-low-ing a pig to run at large â Now gentle-men sweep-ing a shipâ s deck at sea is a piece of house-hold work which in all times but rag-ing gales is reg-u-lar-ly at-tend-ed to every even-ing it has been known to be done in the case of ships ac-tu-al-ly founder-ing at the time Such gentle-men is the in-flex-i-bil-i-ty of sea usages and the in-stinc-tive love of neat-ness in sea-men some of whom would not willing-ly drown without first wash-ing their faces But in all ves-sels this broom busi-ness is the pre-scrip-tive province of the boys if boys there be aboard Be-sides it was the stronger men in the Town Ho that had been di-vid-ed in-to gangs tak-ing turns at the pumps and be-ing the most ath-let-ic sea-man of them all Steelk-ilt had been reg-u-lar-ly as-signed cap-tain of one of the gangs con-se-quent-ly he should have been freed from any triv-ial busi-ness not con-nect-ed with tru-ly nau-ti-cal du-ties such be-ing the case with his com-rades I men-tion all th-ese par-tic-u-lars so that you may un-der-stand ex-act-ly how this af-fair stood between the two men â But there was more than this the order about the shov-el was al-most as plain-ly meant to st-ing and in-sult Steelk-ilt as though Rad-ney had spat in his face Any man who has gone sailor in a whale ship will un-der-stand this and all this and doubt-less much more the Lake-man ful-ly com-pre-hend-ed when the mate ut-tered his com-mand But as he sat still for a mo-ment and as he stead-fast-ly looked in-to the mateâ s malig-nant eye and per-ceived the stacks of pow-der casks heaped up in him and the slow match si-lent-ly burn-ing along towards them as he in-stinc-tive-ly saw all this that strange for-bear-ance and un-will-ing-ness to stir up the deep-er pas-sion-ate-ness in any al-ready ire-ful be-ingâ a repug-nance most felt when felt at all by real-ly valiant men even when ag-grievedâ this name-less phan-tom feel-ing gentle-men stole over Steelk-ilt â There-fore in his or-di-nary tone on-ly a lit-tle bro-ken by the bodi-ly ex-haus-tion he was tem-porar-i-ly in he an-swered him say-ing that sweep-ing the deck was not his busi-ness and he would not do it And then without at all al-lud-ing to the shov-el he point-ed to three lads as the cus-tom-ary sweep-ers who not be-ing bil-let-ed at the pumps had done lit-tle or noth-ing all day To this Rad-ney replied with an oath in a most dom-i-neer-ing and ou-tra-geous man-ner un-con-di-tion-al-ly reit-er-at-ing his com-mand mean-while ad-vanc-ing upon the still seat-ed Lake-man with an uplift-ed coop-erâ s club ham-mer which he had snatched from a cask near by â Heat-ed and ir-ri-tat-ed as he was by his spas-mod-ic toil at the pumps for all his first name-less feel-ing of for-bear-ance the sweat-ing Steelk-ilt could but ill brook this bear-ing in the mate but some-how still smoth-er-ing the con-fla-gra-tion within him without speak-ing he re-mained dogged-ly root-ed to his seat till at last the in-censed Rad-ney shook the ham-mer within a few inch-es of his face fu-ri-ous-ly com-mand-ing him to do his bid-ding â Steelk-ilt rose and slow-ly re-treat-ing round the wind-lass steadi-ly fol-lowed by the mate with his me-nac-ing ham-mer de-lib-er-ate-ly re-peat-ed his in-ten-tion not to obey See-ing how-ev-er that his for-bear-ance had not the slight-est ef-fect by an aw-ful and un-speak-able in-ti-ma-tion with his twist-ed hand he warned off the fool-ish and in-fat-u-at-ed man but it was to no pur-pose And in this way the two went once slow-ly round the wind-lass when re-solved at last no longer to re-treat be-think-ing him that he had now for-borne as much as com-port-ed with his hu-mor the Lake-man paused on the hatch-es and thus spoke to the of-fi-cer â â Mr Rad-ney I will not obey you Take that ham-mer away or look to your-self â But the pre-des-ti-nat-ed mate com-ing still clos-er to him where the Lake-man stood fixed now shook the heavy ham-mer within an inch of his teeth mean-while re-peat-ing a string of in-suf-fer-able male-dic-tions Re-treat-ing not the thou-sandth part of an inch stab-bing him in the eye with the un-flinch-ing po-niard of his glance Steelk-ilt clench-ing his right hand be-hind him and creep-ing-ly draw-ing it back told his per-se-cu-tor that if the ham-mer but grazed his cheek he Steelk-ilt would mur-der him But gentle-men the fool had been brand-ed for the slaugh-ter by the gods Im-me-di-ate-ly the ham-mer touched the cheek the next in-stant the low-er jaw of the mate was stove in his head he fell on the hatch spout-ing blood like a whale â Ere the cry could go aft Steelk-ilt was shak-ing one of the back-stays lead-ing far aloft to where two of his com-rades were stand-ing their mast-heads They were both Canallers â â Canallers â cried Don Pe-dro â We have seen many whale ships in our har-bours but nev-er heard of your Canallers Par-don who and what are they â â â Canallers Don are the boat-men be-long-ing to our grand Erie Canal You must have heard of it â â â Nay Senor here-abouts in this dull warm most lazy and hered-i-tary land we know but lit-tle of your vig-or-ous North â â â Aye Well then Don re-fill my cup Your chichaâ s very fine and ere pro-ceed-ing fur-ther I will tell ye what our Canallers are for such in-for-ma-tion may throw side light upon my sto-ry â â For three hun-dred and six-ty miles gentle-men through the en-tire breadth of the state of New York through numer-ous pop-u-lous ci-ties and most thriv-ing vil-lages through long dis-mal un-in-hab-it-ed swamps and af-flu-ent cul-ti-vat-ed fields un-ri-valled for fer-til-i-ty by bil-liard room and bar room through the holy of holies of great forests on Ro-man arch-es over In-di-an rivers through sun and shade by hap-py hearts or bro-ken through all the wide con-trast-ing scenery of those noble Mo-hawk coun-ties and espe-cial-ly by rows of snow white chapels whose spires stand al-most like mile-stones flows one con-tin-u-al stream of Vene-tian-ly cor-rupt and often law-less life Thereâ s your true Ashantee gentle-men there howl your pa-gans where you ever find them next door to you un-der the long flung shad-ow and the snug pa-tro-n-is-ing lee of church-es For by some cu-ri-ous fatal-i-ty as it is often not-ed of your metropoli-tan free-boot-ers that they ever en-camp around the hal-ls of jus-tice so sin-ners gentle-men most abound in holi-est vicini-ties â â Is that a fri-ar pass-ing â said Don Pe-dro look-ing down-wards in-to the crowd-ed plaz-za with hu-mor-ous con-cern â â Well for our north-ern friend Dame Is-abel-laâ s In-qui-si-tion wanes in Li-ma â laughed Don Se-bas-tian â Pro-ceed Senor â â â A mo-ment Par-don â cried another of the com-pa-ny â In the name of all us Limeese I but de-sire to ex-press to you sir sailor that we have by no means over-looked your del-i-ca-cy in not sub-sti-tut-ing pre-sent Li-ma for dis-tant Venice in your cor-rupt com-par-i-son Oh do not bow and look sur-prised you know the proverb all along this coastâ â Cor-rupt as Li-ma â It but bears out your say-ing too church-es more plen-ti-ful than bil-liard tables and for ever openâ and â Cor-rupt as Li-ma â So too Venice I have been there the holy ci-ty of the blessed evan-ge-list St Mark â St Do-minic purge it Your cup Thanks here I re-fill now you pour out again â â Freely depict-ed in his own vo-ca-tion gentle-men the Canaller would make a fine dra-mat-ic hero so abun-dant-ly and pic-turesque-ly wicked is he Like Mark Antony for days and days along his green turfed flow-ery Nile he in-do-lent-ly floats open-ly toy-ing with his red cheeked Cleopa-tra ripen-ing his apri-cot thigh upon the sun-ny deck But ashore all this ef-fem-i-na-cy is dashed The bri-g-an-dish guise which the Canaller so proud-ly sports his slouched and gai-ly rib-boned hat be-to-ken his grand fea-tures A ter-ror to the smil-ing in-no-cence of the vil-lages through which he floats his swart vis-age and bold swag-ger are not un-shunned in ci-ties Once a vagabond on his own canal I have re-ceived good turns from one of th-ese Canallers I thank him hearti-ly would fain be not un-grate-ful but it is often one of the prime redeem-ing qual-i-ties of your man of vi-o-lence that at times he has as stiff an arm to back a poor stranger in a strait as to plun-der a wealthy one In sum gentle-men what the wild-ness of this canal life is is em-phat-i-cal-ly evinced by this that our wild whale fish-ery con-tains so many of its most fin-ished grad-u-ates and that scarce any race of mankind ex-cept Syd-ney men are so much distrust-ed by our whal-ing cap-tains Nor does it at all di-min-ish the cu-ri-ous-ness of this mat-ter that to many thou-sands of our ru-ral boys and young men born along its line the pro-ba-tion-ary life of the Grand Canal fur-nish-es the sole tran-si-tion between qui-et-ly reap-ing in a Chris-tian corn field and reck-less-ly plough-ing the waters of the most bar-bar-ic seas â â I see I see â im-petu-ous-ly ex-claimed Don Pe-dro spilling his chicha upon his sil-very ruf-fles â No need to trav-el The worldâ s one Li-ma I had thought now that at your tem-per-ate North the gen-er-a-tions were cold and holy as the hil-ls â But the sto-ry â â I left off gentle-men where the Lake-man shook the back-stay Hard-ly had he done so when he was sur-round-ed by the three ju-nior mates and the four har-pooneers who all crowd-ed him to the deck But slid-ing down the ropes like bale-ful comets the two Canallers rushed in-to the uproar and sought to drag their man out of it towards the fore-cas-tle Others of the sailors joined with them in this at-tempt and a twist-ed tur-moil en-sued while stand-ing out of har-mâ s way the valiant cap-tain danced up and down with a whale pike calling upon his of-fi-cers to man-han-dle that atro-cious scoundrel and smoke him along to the quar-ter deck At in-ter-vals he ran close up to the re-volv-ing border of the con-fu-sion and pry-ing in-to the heart of it with his pike sought to prick out the ob-ject of his re-sent-ment But Steelk-ilt and his des-per-a-does were too much for them all they suc-ceed-ed in gain-ing the fore-cas-tle deck where hasti-ly slew-ing about three or four large casks in a line with the wind-lass th-ese sea Parisians en-trenched them-selves be-hind the bar-ri-cade â â Come out of that ye pi-rates â roared the cap-tain now me-nac-ing them with a pis-tol in each hand just brought to him by the ste-ward â Come out of that ye cut throats â â Steelk-ilt leaped on the bar-ri-cade and strid-ing up and down there de-fied the worst the pis-tols could do but gave the cap-tain to un-der-stand distinct-ly that his Steelk-iltâ s death would be the sig-nal for a mur-der-ous mutiny on the part of all hands Fear-ing in his heart lest this might prove but too true the cap-tain a lit-tle de-sist-ed but still com-mand-ed the in-sur-gen-ts in-stant-ly to re-turn to their du-ty â â Will you promise not to touch us if we do â de-mand-ed their rin-glead-er â â Turn to turn to â I make no promise â to your du-ty Do you want to sink the ship by knock-ing off at a time like this Turn to â and he once more raised a pis-tol â â Sink the ship â cried Steelk-ilt â Aye let her sink Not a man of us turns to un-less you swear not to raise a rope yarn against us What say ye men â turn-ing to his com-rades A fierce cheer was their re-sponse â The Lake-man now pa-trolled the bar-ri-cade all the while keep-ing his eye on the Cap-tain and jerk-ing out such sen-tences as th-ese â â Itâ s not our fault we did-nâ t want it I told him to take his ham-mer away it was boyâ s busi-ness he might have known me be-fore this I told him not to prick the buf-fa-lo I believe I have bro-ken a finger here against his cursed jaw ainâ t those minc-ing knives down in the fore-cas-tle there men look to those hand-spikes my hearties Cap-tain by God look to your-self say the word donâ t be a fool for-get it all we are ready to turn to treat us de-cent-ly and weâ re your men but we wonâ t be flogged â â â Turn to I make no promis-es turn to I say â â â Look ye now â cried the Lake-man fling-ing out his arm towards him â there are a few of us here and I am one of them who have shipped for the cruise dâ ye see now as you well know sir we can claim our dis-charge as soon as the an-chor is down so we donâ t want a row itâ s not our in-ter-est we want to be peace-able we are ready to work but we wonâ t be flogged â â â Turn to â roared the Cap-tain â Steelk-ilt glanced round him a mo-ment and then said â â I tell you what it is now Cap-tain rather than kill ye and be hung for such a shab-by ras-cal we wonâ t lift a hand against ye un-less ye at-tack us but till you say the word about not flog-ging us we donâ t do a handâ s turn â â â Down in-to the fore-cas-tle then down with ye Iâ ll keep ye there till yeâ re sick of it Down ye go â â â Shall we â cried the rin-glead-er to his men Most of them were against it but at length in obe-di-ence to Steelk-ilt they pre-ced-ed him down in-to their dark den growl-ing-ly dis-ap-pear-ing like bears in-to a cave â As the Lake-manâ s bare head was just lev-el with the planks the Cap-tain and his posse leaped the bar-ri-cade and rapid-ly draw-ing over the slide of the scut-tle plant-ed their group of hands upon it and loud-ly called for the ste-ward to bring the heavy brass pad-lock be-long-ing to the com-pan-ion-way Then open-ing the slide a lit-tle the Cap-tain whis-pered some-thing down the crack closed it and turned the key upon themâ ten in num-berâ leav-ing on deck some twen-ty or more who thus far had re-mained neu-tral â All night a wide awake watch was kept by all the of-fi-cers for-ward and aft espe-cial-ly about the fore-cas-tle scut-tle and fore hatch-way at which last place it was feared the in-sur-gen-ts might emerge after break-ing through the bulk-head below But the hours of dark-ness passed in peace the men who still re-mained at their du-ty toil-ing hard at the pumps whose clink-ing and clank-ing at in-ter-vals through the dreary night dis-mal-ly re-sound-ed through the ship â At sun-rise the Cap-tain went for-ward and knock-ing on the deck sum-moned the prison-ers to work but with a yell they re-fused Water was then low-ered down to them and a cou-ple of hand-fuls of bis-cuit were tossed after it when again turn-ing the key upon them and pock-et-ing it the Cap-tain re-turned to the quar-ter deck Twice every day for three days this was re-peat-ed but on the fourth morn-ing a con-fused wran-gling and then a scuf-fling was heard as the cus-tom-ary sum-mons was de-liv-ered and sud-den-ly four men burst up from the fore-cas-tle say-ing they were ready to turn to The fetid close-ness of the air and a famish-ing di-et unit-ed per-haps to some fears of ul-ti-mate retri-bu-tion had con-strained them to sur-ren-der at dis-cre-tion Em-bold-ened by this the Cap-tain reit-er-at-ed his de-mand to the rest but Steelk-ilt shout-ed up to him a ter-rif-ic hint to stop his bab-bling and be-take him-self where he be-longed On the fifth morn-ing three others of the mu-ti-neers bolt-ed up in-to the air from the des-per-ate ar-ms below that sought to res-train them On-ly three were left â â Bet-ter turn to now â said the Cap-tain with a heart-less jeer â â Shut us up again will ye â cried Steelk-ilt â â Oh cer-tain-ly â said the Cap-tain and the key clicked â It was at this point gentle-men that en-raged by the de-fec-tion of seven of his former as-so-ci-ates and stung by the mock-ing voice that had last hailed him and mad-dened by his long en-tomb-ment in a place as black as the bow-els of de-s-pair it was then that Steelk-ilt pro-posed to the two Canallers thus far ap-par-ent-ly of one mind with him to burst out of their hole at the next sum-mon-ing of the gar-ri-son and armed with their keen minc-ing knives long cres-cen-tic heavy im-ple-men-ts with a han-dle at each end run amuck from the bowsprit to the taf-frail and if by any devil-ish-ness of des-per-a-tion pos-si-ble seize the ship For him-self he would do this he said whether they joined him or not That was the last night he should spend in that den But the scheme met with no op-po-si-tion on the part of the other two they swore they were ready for that or for any other mad thing for any-thing in short but a sur-ren-der And what was more they each in-sist-ed upon be-ing the first man on deck when the time to make the rush should come But to this their lead-er as fierce-ly ob-ject-ed re-serv-ing that pri-or-i-ty for him-self par-tic-u-lar-ly as his two com-rades would not yield the one to the other in the mat-ter and both of them could not be first for the lad-der would but ad-mit one man at a time And here gentle-men the foul play of th-ese mis-cre-an-ts must come out â Upon hear-ing the fran-tic pro-ject of their lead-er each in his own separate soul had sud-den-ly light-ed it would seem upon the same piece of treach-ery name-ly to be fore-most in break-ing out in order to be the first of the three though the last of the ten to sur-ren-der and there-by se-cure what-ev-er small chance of par-don such con-duct might mer-it But when Steelk-ilt made known his deter-mi-na-tion still to lead them to the last they in some way by some sub-tle chem-istry of vil-lany mixed their be-fore se-cret treacheries to-geth-er and when their lead-er fell in-to a doze ver-bal-ly opened their souls to each other in three sen-tences and bound the sleep-er with cords and gagged him with cords and shrieked out for the Cap-tain at mid-night â Think-ing mur-der at hand and smelling in the dark for the blood he and all his armed mates and har-pooneers rushed for the fore-cas-tle In a few min-utes the scut-tle was opened and bound hand and foot the still strug-gling rin-glead-er was shoved up in-to the air by his per-fid-i-ous al-lies who at once claimed the honor of se-cur-ing a man who had been ful-ly ripe for mur-der But all th-ese were col-lared and dragged along the deck like dead cat-tle and side by side were seized up in-to the mizzen rig-ging like three quar-ters of meat and there they hung till morn-ing â Damn ye â cried the Cap-tain pac-ing to and fro be-fore them â the vul-tures would not touch ye ye vil-lains â â At sun-rise he sum-moned all hands and separat-ing those who had re-belled from those who had tak-en no part in the mutiny he told the former that he had a good mind to flog them all roundâ thought upon the whole he would do soâ he ought toâ jus-tice de-mand-ed it but for the pre-sent con-sid-er-ing their time-ly sur-ren-der he would let them go with a rep-ri-mand which he ac-cord-ing-ly ad-min-is-tered in the ver-nac-u-lar â â But as for you ye car-rion rogues â turn-ing to the three men in the rig-gingâ â for you I mean to mince ye up for the try pots â and seiz-ing a rope he ap-plied it with all his might to the backs of the two traitors till they yelled no more but life-less-ly hung their heads side-ways as the two cru-ci-fied thieves are drawn â â My wrist is sprained with ye â he cried at last â but there is still rope enough left for you my fine ban-tam that would-nâ t give up Take that gag from his mouth and let us hear what he can say for him-self â â For a mo-ment the ex-haust-ed mu-ti-neer made a tremu-lous mo-tion of his cramped jaws and then pain-ful-ly twist-ing round his head said in a sort of hiss â What I say is thisâ and mind it wel-lâ if you flog me I mur-der you â â â Say ye so then see how ye fright-en meâ â and the Cap-tain drew off with the rope to strike â â Best not â hissed the Lake-man â â But I must â â and the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke â Steelk-ilt here hissed out some-thing inaudi-ble to all but the Cap-tain who to the amaze-ment of all hands start-ed back paced the deck rapid-ly two or three times and then sud-den-ly throw-ing down his rope said â I wonâ t do itâ let him goâ cut him down dâ ye hear â â But as the ju-nior mates were hur-ry-ing to ex-e-cute the order a pale man with a bandaged head ar-rest-ed themâ Rad-ney the chief mate Ever since the blow he had lain in his berth but that morn-ing hear-ing the tu-mult on the deck he had crept out and thus far had watched the whole scene Such was the state of his mouth that he could hard-ly speak but mum-bling some-thing about his be-ing willing and able to do what the cap-tain dared not at-tempt he snatched the rope and ad-vanced to his pin-ioned foe â â You are a coward â hissed the Lake-man â â So I am but take that â The mate was in the very act of strik-ing when another hiss stayed his uplift-ed arm He paused and then paus-ing no more made good his word spite of Steelk-iltâ s threat what-ev-er that might have been The three men were then cut down all hands were turned to and sul-len-ly worked by the moody sea-men the iron pumps clanged as be-fore â Just after dark that day when one watch had re-tired below a clam-or was heard in the fore-cas-tle and the two trem-bling traitors run-ning up be-sieged the cabin door say-ing they durst not con-sort with the crew En-treaties cuffs and kicks could not drive them back so at their own in-stance they were put down in the shipâ s run for sal-va-tion Still no sign of mutiny reap-peared among the rest On the con-trary it seemed that main-ly at Steelk-iltâ s in-sti-ga-tion they had re-solved to main-tain the strictest peace-ful-ness obey all orders to the last and when the ship reached port desert her in a body But in order to in-sure the speed-i-est end to the voy-age they all agreed to another thingâ name-ly not to sing out for whales in case any should be dis-cov-ered For spite of her leak and spite of all her other per-ils the Town Ho still main-tained her mast heads and her cap-tain was just as willing to low-er for a fish that mo-ment as on the day his craft first struck the cruis-ing ground and Rad-ney the mate was quite as ready to change his berth for a boat and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vi-tal jaw of the whale â But though the Lake-man had in-duced the sea-men to adopt this sort of pas-sive-ness in their con-duct he kept his own coun-sel at least till all was over con-cern-ing his own prop-er and pri-vate re-venge upon the man who had stung him in the ven-tri-cles of his heart He was in Rad-ney the chief mateâ s watch and as if the in-fat-u-at-ed man sought to run more than half way to meet his doom after the scene at the rig-ging he in-sist-ed against the ex-press coun-sel of the cap-tain upon re-sum-ing the head of his watch at night Upon this and one or two other cir-cum-stances Steelk-ilt sys-tem-at-i-cal-ly built the plan of his re-venge â Dur-ing the night Rad-ney had an unsea-man-like way of sit-ting on the bul-warks of the quar-ter deck and lean-ing his arm upon the gun-wale of the boat which was hoist-ed up there a lit-tle above the shipâ s side In this at-ti-tude it was well known he some-times dozed There was a con-sid-er-able va-can-cy between the boat and the ship and down between this was the sea Steelk-ilt cal-cu-lat-ed his time and found that his next trick at the helm would come round at two oâ clock in the morn-ing of the third day from that in which he had been be-trayed At his leisure he em-ployed the in-ter-val in braid-ing some-thing very care-ful-ly in his watch-es below â â What are you mak-ing there â said a ship-mate â â What do you think what does it look like â â â Like a lan-yard for your bag but itâ s an odd one seems to me â â â Yes rather od-dish â said the Lake-man hold-ing it at ar-mâ s length be-fore him â but I think it will an-swer Ship-mate I havenâ t enough twine â have you any â â But there was none in the fore-cas-tle â â Then I must get some from old Rad â and he rose to go aft â â You donâ t mean to go a beg-ging to him â said a sailor â â Why not Do you think he wonâ t do me a turn when itâ s to help him-self in the end ship-mate â and go-ing to the mate he looked at him qui-et-ly and asked him for some twine to mend his ham-mock It was giv-en himâ nei-ther twine nor lan-yard were seen again but the next night an iron ball close-ly net-ted part-ly rolled from the pock-et of the Lake-manâ s mon-key jack-et as he was tuck-ing the coat in-to his ham-mock for a pil-low Twen-ty four hours after his trick at the si-lent helmâ nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave al-ways ready dug to the sea-manâ s handâ that fatal hour was then to come and in the fore or-dain-ing soul of Steelk-ilt the mate was al-ready stark and stretched as a corpse with his fore-head crushed in â But gentle-men a fool saved the would be mur-derer from the bloody deed he had planned Yet com-plete re-venge he had and without be-ing the avenger For by a mys-te-ri-ous fatal-i-ty Heav-en it-self seemed to step in to take out of his hands in-to its own the damn-ing thing he would have done â It was just between day-break and sun-rise of the morn-ing of the se-cond day when they were wash-ing down the decks that a stupid Tener-iffe man draw-ing water in the main chains all at once shout-ed out â There she rol-ls there she rol-ls â Je-su what a whale It was Mo-by Dick â â Mo-by Dick â cried Don Se-bas-tian â St Do-minic Sir sailor but do whales have chris-ten-ings Whom call you Mo-by Dick â â â A very white and fa-mous and most dead-ly im-mor-tal mon-ster Don â but that would be too long a sto-ry â â â How how â cried all the young Spa-niards crowd-ing â â Nay Dons Don-sâ nay nay I can-not re-hearse that now Let me get more in-to the air Sirs â â â The chicha the chicha â cried Don Pe-dro â our vig-or-ous friend looks faint â fill up his emp-ty glass â â No need gentle-men one mo-ment and I pro-ceed â Now gentle-men so sud-den-ly per-ceiv-ing the snowy whale within fifty yards of the shipâ for-get-ful of the com-pact among the crewâ in the ex-cite-ment of the mo-ment the Tener-iffe man had in-stinc-tive-ly and in-vol-un-tar-i-ly lift-ed his voice for the mon-ster though for some lit-tle time past it had been plain-ly be-held from the three sullen mast heads All was now a phren-sy â The White Whaleâ the White Whale â was the cry from cap-tain mates and har-pooneers who un-de-terred by fear-ful ru-mours were all anx-ious to cap-ture so fa-mous and pre-cious a fish while the dogged crew eyed askance and with curs-es the ap-palling beau-ty of the vast milky mass that lit up by a hor-i-zon-tal span-gling sun shift-ed and glis-tened like a liv-ing opal in the blue morn-ing sea Gentle-men a strange fatal-i-ty per-vades the whole ca-reer of th-ese even-ts as if ver-i-ly mapped out be-fore the world it-self was chart-ed The mu-ti-neer was the bows-man of the mate and when fast to a fish it was his du-ty to sit next him while Rad-ney stood up with his lance in the prow and haul in or slack-en the line at the word of com-mand More-over when the four boats were low-ered the mateâ s got the start and none howled more fierce-ly with de-light than did Steelk-ilt as he strained at his oar After a stiff pull their har-pooneer got fast and spear in hand Rad-ney sprang to the bow He was al-ways a fu-ri-ous man it seems in a boat And now his bandaged cry was to beach him on the whaleâ s top-most back Noth-ing loath his bows-man hauled him up and up through a blind-ing foam that blent two white-ness-es to-geth-er till of a sud-den the boat struck as against a sunken ledge and keel-ing over spilled out the stand-ing mate That in-stant as he fell on the whaleâ s slip-pery back the boat right-ed and was dashed aside by the swell while Rad-ney was tossed over in-to the sea on the other flank of the whale He struck out through the spray and for an in-stant was dim-ly seen through that veil wild-ly seek-ing to re-move him-self from the eye of Mo-by Dick But the whale rushed round in a sud-den mael-strom seized the swim-mer between his jaws and rear-ing high up with him plunged head-long again and went down â Mean-time at the first tap of the boatâ s bot-tom the Lake-man had slack-ened the line so as to drop astern from the whirlpool calm-ly look-ing on he thought his own thoughts But a sud-den ter-rif-ic down-ward jerk-ing of the boat quick-ly brought his knife to the line He cut it and the whale was free But at some dis-tance Mo-by Dick rose again with some tat-ters of Rad-neyâ s red woollen shirt caught in the teeth that had de-stroyed him All four boats gave chase again but the whale elud-ed them and fi-nal-ly whol-ly dis-ap-peared â In good time the Town Ho reached her portâ a sav-age soli-tary placeâ where no civ-i-lized crea-ture resid-ed There head-ed by the Lake-man all but five or six of the fore-mast-men de-lib-er-ate-ly de-sert-ed among the palms even-tu-al-ly as it turned out seiz-ing a large dou-ble war ca-noe of the sav-ages and set-ting sail for some other har-bor â The shipâ s com-pa-ny be-ing re-duced to but a hand-ful the cap-tain called upon the Is-lan-ders to as-sist him in the la-bo-ri-ous busi-ness of heav-ing down the ship to stop the leak But to such un-rest-ing vig-i-lance over their danger-ous al-lies was this small band of whites ne-ces-si-tat-ed both by night and by day and so ex-treme was the hard work they un-der-went that upon the ves-sel be-ing ready again for sea they were in such a weak-ened con-di-tion that the cap-tain durst not put off with them in so heavy a ves-sel After tak-ing coun-sel with his of-fi-cers he an-chored the ship as far off shore as pos-si-ble load-ed and ran out his two can-non from the bows stacked his mus-kets on the poop and warn-ing the Is-lan-ders not to ap-proach the ship at their per-il took one man with him and set-ting the sail of his best whale boat steered straight be-fore the wind for Tahi-ti five hun-dred miles dis-tant to pro-cure a re-in-force-ment to his crew â On the fourth day of the sail a large ca-noe was de-scried which seemed to have touched at a low isle of co-rals He steered away from it but the sav-age craft bore down on him and soon the voice of Steelk-ilt hailed him to heave to or he would run him un-der water The cap-tain pre-sent-ed a pis-tol With one foot on each prow of the yoked war ca-noes the Lake-man laughed him to scorn as-sur-ing him that if the pis-tol so much as clicked in the lock he would bury him in bub-bles and foam â â What do you want of me â cried the cap-tain â â Where are you bound and for what are you bound â de-mand-ed Steelk-ilt â no lies â â â I am bound to Tahi-ti for more men â â â Very good Let me board you a mo-men-tâ I come in peace â With that he leaped from the ca-noe swam to the boat and climb-ing the gun-wale stood face to face with the cap-tain â â Cross your ar-ms sir throw back your head Now re-peat after me As soon as Steelk-ilt leaves me I swear to beach this boat on yon-der is-land and re-main there six days If I do not may light-nings strike me â â â A pret-ty schol-ar â laughed the Lake-man â Adios Senor â and leap-ing in-to the sea he swam back to his com-rades â Watch-ing the boat till it was fair-ly beached and drawn up to the roots of the co-coa nut trees Steelk-ilt made sail again and in due time ar-rived at Tahi-ti his own place of desti-na-tion There luck be-friend-ed him two ships were about to sail for France and were prov-i-den-tial-ly in want of pre-cise-ly that num-ber of men which the sailor head-ed They em-barked and so for ever got the start of their former cap-tain had he been at all mind-ed to work them le-gal retri-bu-tion â Some ten days after the French ships sailed the whale boat ar-rived and the cap-tain was forced to en-list some of the more civ-i-lized Tahi-tians who had been some-what used to the sea Char-ter-ing a small na-tive schooner he re-turned with them to his ves-sel and find-ing all right there again re-sumed his cruis-ings â Where Steelk-ilt now is gentle-men none know but upon the is-land of Nan-tuck-et the wi-d-ow of Rad-ney still turns to the sea which re-fus-es to give up its dead still in dreams sees the aw-ful white whale that de-stroyed him â â Are you through â said Don Se-bas-tian qui-et-ly â â I am Don â â â Then I en-treat you tell me if to the best of your own con-vic-tions this your sto-ry is in sub-stance real-ly true It is so pass-ing won-der-ful Did you get it from an un-ques-tion-able source Bear with me if I seem to press â â â Al-so bear with all of us sir sailor for we all join in Don Se-bas-tianâ s suit â cried the com-pa-ny with ex-ceed-ing in-ter-est â â Is there a copy of the Holy Evan-ge-lists in the Gold-en Inn gentle-men â â â Nay â said Don Se-bas-tian â but I know a wor-thy pri-est near by who will quick-ly pro-cure one for me I go for it but are you well ad-vised this may grow too se-ri-ous â â â Will you be so good as to bring the pri-est al-so Don â â â Though there are no Au-to da FÃ s in Li-ma now â said one of the com-pa-ny to another â I fear our sailor friend runs risk of the archiepis-co-pa-cy Let us with-draw more out of the moon-light I see no need of this â â â Ex-cuse me for run-ning after you Don Se-bas-tian but may I al-so beg that you will be par-tic-u-lar in procur-ing the largest sized Evan-ge-lists you can â â â This is the pri-est he brings you the Evan-ge-lists â said Don Se-bas-tian grave-ly re-turn-ing with a tall and solemn fig-ure â â Let me re-move my hat Now ven-er-a-ble pri-est fur-ther in-to the light and hold the Holy Book be-fore me that I may touch it â â So help me Heav-en and on my honor the sto-ry I have told ye gentle-men is in sub-stance and its great items true I know it to be true it hap-pened on this ball I trod the ship I knew the crew I have seen and talked with Steelk-ilt since the death of Rad-ney â â CHAPTER 55 Of the Mon-strous Pic-tures of Whales I shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without can-vas some-thing like the true form of the whale as he ac-tu-al-ly ap-pears to the eye of the whale-man when in his own ab-so-lute body the whale is moored along-side the whale ship so that he can be fair-ly stepped upon there It may be worth while there-fore pre-vi-ous-ly to ad-vert to those cu-ri-ous imag-i-nary por-traits of him which even down to the pre-sent day con-fi-dent-ly chal-lenge the faith of the lands-man It is time to set the world right in this mat-ter by prov-ing such pic-tures of the whale all wrong It may be that the pri-mal source of all those pic-to-ri-al delu-sions will be found among the oldest Hin-doo Egyp-tian and Gre-cian sculp-tures For ever since those in-ven-tive but un-scrupu-lous times when on the mar-ble panellings of tem-ples the pedestals of stat-ues and on shields medal-lions cups and coins the dol-phin was drawn in scales of chain ar-mor like Sal-ad-inâ s and a hel-met-ed head like St Ge-orgeâ s ever since then has some-thing of the same sort of li-cense pre-vailed not on-ly in most pop-u-lar pic-tures of the whale but in many sci-en-tif-ic pre-sen-ta-tions of him Now by all od-ds the most an-cient ex-tant por-trait any-ways pur-port-ing to be the whaleâ s is to be found in the fa-mous cav-ern pago-da of Ele-phan-ta in In-dia The Brah-mins main-tain that in the al-most end-less sculp-tures of that im-memo-ri-al pago-da all the trades and pur-suits every con-ceiv-able avo-ca-tion of man were pre-fig-ured ages be-fore any of them ac-tu-al-ly came in-to be-ing No won-der then that in some sort our noble pro-fes-sion of whal-ing should have been there shad-owed forth The Hin-doo whale re-ferred to oc-curs in a separate depart-ment of the wall depict-ing the in-car-na-tion of Vish-nu in the form of le-viathan learned-ly known as the Matse Avatar But though this sculp-ture is half man and half whale so as on-ly to give the tail of the lat-ter yet that small sec-tion of him is all wrong It looks more like the taper-ing tail of an ana-con-da than the broad palms of the true whaleâ s ma-jes-tic flukes But go to the old Gal-leries and look now at a great Chris-tian pain-terâ s por-trait of this fish for he suc-ceeds no bet-ter than the ante-dilu-vian Hin-doo It is Guidoâ s pic-ture of Perseus res-cu-ing An-drome-da from the sea mon-ster or whale Where did Gui-do get the model of such a strange crea-ture as that Nor does Hog-a-rth in paint-ing the same scene in his own â Perseus Descend-ing â make out one whit bet-ter The huge cor-pu-lence of that Hog-a-rthi-an mon-ster un-du-lates on the sur-face scarce-ly draw-ing one inch of water It has a sort of how-dah on its back and its dis-tend-ed tusked mouth in-to which the bil-lows are rolling might be tak-en for the Traitorsâ Gate lead-ing from the Thames by water in-to the Tow-er Then there are the Pro-dro-mus whales of old Scotch Sib-bald and Jon-ahâ s whale as depict-ed in the prin-ts of old Bi-bles and the cuts of old primers What shall be said of th-ese As for the book bin-derâ s whale wind-ing like a vine stalk round the stock of a descend-ing an-chorâ as stamped and gild-ed on the backs and ti-tle pages of many books both old and newâ that is a very pic-turesque but pure-ly fab-u-lous crea-ture imi-tat-ed I take it from the like fig-ures on an-tique vas-es Though univer-sal-ly denom-i-nat-ed a dol-phin I nev-er-the-less call this book bin-derâ s fish an at-tempt at a whale be-cause it was so in-tend-ed when the de-vice was first in-tro-duced It was in-tro-duced by an old Ital-ian pub-lish-er some-where about the 15th cen-tu-ry dur-ing the Re-vival of Learn-ing and in those days and even down to a com-par-a-tive-ly late pe-ri-od dol-phins were pop-u-lar-ly sup-posed to be a species of the Le-viathan In the vignettes and other em-bel-lish-men-ts of some an-cient books you will at times meet with very cu-ri-ous touch-es at the whale where all man-ner of spouts jets dâ eau hot springs and cold Sarato-ga and Baden Baden come bub-bling up from his unex-haust-ed brain In the ti-tle page of the orig-i-nal edi-tion of the â Ad-vance-ment of Learn-ingâ you will find some cu-ri-ous whales But quit-ting all th-ese un-pro-fes-sion-al at-temp-ts let us glance at those pic-tures of le-viathan pur-port-ing to be sober sci-en-tif-ic de-lin-eations by those who know In old Har-risâ s col-lec-tion of voy-ages there are some plates of whales ex-tract-ed from a Dutch book of voy-ages A D 1671 en-ti-tled â A Whal-ing Voy-age to Spitzber-gen in the ship Jonas in the Whale Peter Peter-son of Fries-land master â In one of those plates the whales like great rafts of logs are rep-re-sent-ed ly-ing among ice isles with white bears run-ning over their liv-ing backs In another plate the prodi-gious blun-der is made of rep-re-sent-ing the whale with per-pen-dic-u-lar flukes Then again there is an im-pos-ing quar-to writ-ten by one Cap-tain Col-nett a Post Cap-tain in the English navy en-ti-tled â A Voy-age round Cape Horn in-to the South Seas for the pur-pose of ex-tend-ing the Sper-ma-ceti Whale Fish-eries â In this book is an out-line pur-port-ing to be a â Pic-ture of a Phy-seter or Sper-ma-ceti whale drawn by scale from one killed on the coast of Mex-i-co Au-gust 1793 and hoist-ed on deck â I doubt not the cap-tain had this vera-cious pic-ture tak-en for the ben-e-fit of his marines To men-tion but one thing about it let me say that it has an eye which ap-plied ac-cord-ing to the ac-com-pa-ny-ing scale to a full grown sperm whale would make the eye of that whale a bow win-dow some five feet long Ah my gal-lant cap-tain why did ye not give us Jon-ah look-ing out of that eye Nor are the most con-sci-en-tious com-pi-la-tions of Nat-u-ral His-to-ry for the ben-e-fit of the young and ten-der free from the same heinous-ness of mis-take Look at that pop-u-lar work â Gold-smithâ s An-i-mat-ed Na-ture â In the abridged Lon-don edi-tion of 187 there are plates of an al-leged â whaleâ and a â nar-whale â I do not wish to seem inel-e-gant but this un-sight-ly whale looks much like an am-pu-tat-ed sow and as for the nar-whale one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one that in this nine-teenth cen-tu-ry such a hip-pogriff could be palmed for gen-uine upon any in-tel-li-gent public of school-boys Then again in 1825 Bernard Ger-main Count de LacÃ pÃ de a great nat-u-ral-ist pub-lished a sci-en-tif-ic sys-tem-ized whale book where-in are sev-er-al pic-tures of the dif-fer-ent species of the Le-viathan All th-ese are not on-ly in-cor-rect but the pic-ture of the Mys-tice-tus or Green-land whale that is to say the Right whale even Scores-by a long ex-pe-ri-enced man as touch-ing that species de-clares not to have its coun-ter-part in na-ture But the plac-ing of the cap sheaf to all this blun-der-ing busi-ness was re-served for the sci-en-tif-ic Fred-er-ick Cu-vi-er brother to the fa-mous Baron In 1836 he pub-lished a Nat-u-ral His-to-ry of Whales in which he gives what he cal-ls a pic-ture of the Sperm Whale Be-fore show-ing that pic-ture to any Nan-tuck-eter you had best pro-vide for your sum-ma-ry re-treat from Nan-tuck-et In a word Fred-er-ick Cu-vierâ s Sperm Whale is not a Sperm Whale but a squash Of course he nev-er had the ben-e-fit of a whal-ing voy-age such men sel-dom have but whence he derived that pic-ture who can tell Per-haps he got it as his sci-en-tif-ic pre-de-ces-sor in the same field Des-marest got one of his authen-tic abor-tions that is from a Chi-nese draw-ing And what sort of live-ly lads with the pen-cil those Chi-nese are many queer cups and saucers in-form us As for the sign pain-ter-sâ whales seen in the streets hang-ing over the shops of oil deal-ers what shall be said of them They are gen-er-al-ly Richard III whales with dromedary humps and very sav-age break-fast-ing on three or four sailor tarts that is whale-boats full of mariners their de-for-mi-ties floun-der-ing in seas of blood and blue paint But th-ese man-i-fold mis-takes in depict-ing the whale are not so very sur-pris-ing after all Con-sid-er Most of the sci-en-tif-ic draw-ings have been tak-en from the strand-ed fish and th-ese are about as cor-rect as a draw-ing of a wrecked ship with bro-ken back would cor-rect-ly rep-re-sent the noble an-i-mal it-self in all its un-dashed pride of hull and spars Though ele-phan-ts have stood for their full lengths the liv-ing Le-viathan has nev-er yet fair-ly float-ed him-self for his por-trait The liv-ing whale in his full majesty and sig-nif-i-cance is on-ly to be seen at sea in un-fath-omable waters and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight like a launched line of bat-tle ship and out of that ele-ment it is a thing eter-nal-ly im-pos-si-ble for mor-tal man to hoist him bodi-ly in-to the air so as to pre-serve all his mighty swells and un-du-la-tions And not to speak of the high-ly pre-sum-able dif-fer-ence of con-tour between a young suck-ing whale and a full grown Pla-to-ni-an Le-viathan yet even in the case of one of those young suck-ing whales hoist-ed to a shipâ s deck such is then the out-landish eel like lim-bered vary-ing shape of him that his pre-cise ex-pres-sion the devil him-self could not catch But it may be fan-cied that from the naked skele-ton of the strand-ed whale ac-cu-rate hin-ts may be derived touch-ing his true form Not at all For it is one of the more cu-ri-ous things about this Le-viathan that his skele-ton gives very lit-tle idea of his gen-er-al shape Though Jere-my Ben-thamâ s skele-ton which hangs for can-de-labra in the li-brary of one of his ex-ecu-tors cor-rect-ly con-veys the idea of a burly browed util-i-tar-i-an old gentle-man with all Jere-myâ s other lead-ing per-son-al char-ac-ter-is-tics yet noth-ing of this kind could be in-ferred from any le-viathanâ s ar-tic-u-lat-ed bones In fact as the great Hunter says the mere skele-ton of the whale bears the same re-la-tion to the ful-ly in-vest-ed and padded an-i-mal as the in-sect does to the chrysalis that so round-ing-ly en-velopes it This pe-cu-liar-i-ty is strik-ing-ly evinced in the head as in some part of this book will be in-ci-den-tal-ly shown It is al-so very cu-ri-ous-ly dis-played in the side fin the bones of which al-most ex-act-ly an-swer to the bones of the hu-man hand mi-nus on-ly the thumb This fin has four reg-u-lar bone fingers the in-dex mid-dle ring and lit-tle finger But all th-ese are per-ma-nent-ly lodged in their fleshy cover-ing as the hu-man fingers in an ar-ti-fi-cial cover-ing â How-ev-er reck-less-ly the whale may some-times serve us â said hu-mor-ous Stubb one day â he can nev-er be tru-ly said to han-dle us without mit-tens â For all th-ese rea-sons then any way you may look at it you must needs con-clude that the great Le-viathan is that one crea-ture in the world which must re-main un-paint-ed to the last True one por-trait may hit the mark much nearer than another but none can hit it with any very con-sid-er-able de-gree of ex-act-ness So there is no earth-ly way of find-ing out pre-cise-ly what the whale real-ly looks like And the on-ly mode in which you can derive even a tol-er-a-ble idea of his liv-ing con-tour is by go-ing a whal-ing your-self but by so do-ing you run no small risk of be-ing eter-nal-ly stove and sunk by him Where-fore it seems to me you had best not be too fas-tid-i-ous in your cu-rios-i-ty touch-ing this Le-viathan CHAPTER 56 Of the Less Er-ro-neous Pic-tures of Whales and the True Pic-tures of Whal-ing Scenes In con-nex-ion with the mon-strous pic-tures of whales I am strong-ly tempt-ed here to en-ter upon those still more mon-strous sto-ries of them which are to be found in cer-tain books both an-cient and modern espe-cial-ly in Pliny Pur-chas Hack-luyt Har-ris Cu-vi-er etc But I pass that mat-ter by I know of on-ly four pub-lished out-lines of the great Sperm Whale Col-net-tâ s Hug-gin-sâ s Fred-er-ick Cu-vierâ s and Bealeâ s In the pre-vi-ous chap-ter Col-nett and Cu-vi-er have been re-ferred to Hug-gin-sâ s is far bet-ter than theirs but by great od-ds Bealeâ s is the best All Bealeâ s draw-ings of this whale are good ex-cept-ing the mid-dle fig-ure in the pic-ture of three whales in var-i-ous at-ti-tudes cap-ping his se-cond chap-ter His fron-tispiece boats at-tack-ing Sperm Whales though no doubt cal-cu-lat-ed to ex-cite the civ-il scep-ti-cism of some par-lor men is ad-mirably cor-rect and life like in its gen-er-al ef-fect Some of the Sperm Whale draw-ings in J Ross Browne are pret-ty cor-rect in con-tour but they are wretched-ly en-graved That is not his fault though Of the Right Whale the best out-line pic-tures are in Scores-by but they are drawn on too small a scale to con-vey a de-sir-able im-pres-sion He has but one pic-ture of whal-ing scenes and this is a sad de-fi-cien-cy be-cause it is by such pic-tures on-ly when at all well done that you can derive any-thing like a truth-ful idea of the liv-ing whale as seen by his liv-ing hun-ters But tak-en for all in all by far the finest though in some de-tails not the most cor-rect pre-sen-ta-tions of whales and whal-ing scenes to be any-where found are two large French en-grav-ings well ex-e-cut-ed and tak-en from paint-ings by one Garn-ery Re-spec-tive-ly they rep-re-sent at-tacks on the Sperm and Right Whale In the first en-grav-ing a noble Sperm Whale is depict-ed in full majesty of might just risen be-neath the boat from the pro-fun-di-ties of the ocean and bear-ing high in the air upon his back the ter-rif-ic wreck of the stoven planks The prow of the boat is par-tial-ly un-bro-ken and is drawn just balanc-ing upon the mon-sterâ s spine and stand-ing in that prow for that one sin-gle in-com-putable flash of time you be-hold an oars-man half shroud-ed by the in-censed boil-ing spout of the whale and in the act of leap-ing as if from a precipice The ac-tion of the whole thing is won-der-ful-ly good and true The half emp-tied line tub floats on the whitened sea the wood-en poles of the spilled har-poons oblique-ly bob in it the heads of the swim-ming crew are scat-tered about the whale in con-trast-ing ex-pres-sions of af-fright while in the black stormy dis-tance the ship is bear-ing down upon the scene Se-ri-ous fault might be found with the anatom-i-cal de-tails of this whale but let that pass since for the life of me I could not draw so good a one In the se-cond en-grav-ing the boat is in the act of draw-ing along-side the bar-na-cled flank of a large run-ning Right Whale that rol-ls his black weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock slide from the Patag-o-ni-an cliffs His jets are erect full and black like soot so that from so abound-ing a smoke in the chim-ney you would think there must be a brave sup-per cook-ing in the great bow-els below Sea fowls are peck-ing at the small crabs shell fish and other sea candies and mac-ca-roni which the Right Whale some-times car-ries on his pesti-lent back And all the while the thick lipped le-viathan is rush-ing through the deep leav-ing tons of tu-mul-tuous white cur-ds in his wake and caus-ing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a sk-iff caught nigh the pad-dle wheels of an ocean steam-er Thus the fore-ground is all rag-ing com-mo-tion but be-hind in ad-mirable artis-tic con-trast is the glassy lev-el of a sea be-calmed the droop-ing un-starched sails of the pow-er-less ship and the in-ert mass of a dead whale a con-quered fortress with the flag of cap-ture lazi-ly hang-ing from the whale pole insert-ed in-to his spout hole Who Garn-ery the pain-ter is or was I know not But my life for it he was either prac-ti-cal-ly con-ver-sant with his sub-ject or else marvel-lous-ly tu-tored by some ex-pe-ri-enced whale-man The French are the lads for paint-ing ac-tion Go and gaze upon all the paint-ings of Europe and where will you find such a gallery of liv-ing and breath-ing com-mo-tion on can-vas as in that tri-umphal hall at Ver-sailles where the be-hold-er fights his way pell mell through the con-sec-u-tive great bat-tles of France where every sword seems a flash of the North-ern Lights and the suc-ces-sive armed kings and Em-per-ors dash by like a charge of crowned cen-tau-rs Not whol-ly un-wor-thy of a place in that gallery are th-ese sea bat-tle pieces of Garn-ery The nat-u-ral ap-ti-tude of the French for seiz-ing the pic-turesque-ness of things seems to be pe-cu-liar-ly evinced in what paint-ings and en-grav-ings they have of their whal-ing scenes With not one tenth of Eng-landâ s ex-pe-ri-ence in the fish-ery and not the thou-sandth part of that of the Amer-i-cans they have nev-er-the-less fur-nished both na-tions with the on-ly fin-ished sketch-es at all ca-pable of con-vey-ing the real spir-it of the whale hunt For the most part the English and Amer-i-can whale draughts-men seem en-tire-ly con-tent with pre-sent-ing the me-chan-i-cal out-line of things such as the va-cant pro-file of the whale which so far as pic-turesque-ness of ef-fect is con-cerned is about tan-ta-mount to sketch-ing the pro-file of a pyra-mid Even Scores-by the just-ly renowned Right whale-man after giv-ing us a stiff full length of the Green-land whale and three or four del-i-cate minia-tures of nar-whales and por-pois-es treats us to a series of clas-si-cal en-grav-ings of boat hooks chop-ping knives and grap-nels and with the mi-cro-scop-ic dili-gence of a Leuwen-hoeck sub-mits to the in-spec-tion of a shiver-ing world nine-ty six fac sim-i-les of mag-ni-fied Arc-tic snow crys-tals I mean no dis-par-age-ment to the ex-cel-lent voy-ager I honor him for a veter-an but in so im-por-tant a mat-ter it was cer-tain-ly an over-sight not to have pro-cured for every crys-tal a sworn af-fi-davit tak-en be-fore a Green-land Jus-tice of the Peace In ad-di-tion to those fine en-grav-ings from Garn-ery there are two other French en-grav-ings wor-thy of note by some one who sub-scribes him-self â H Du-rand â One of them though not pre-cise-ly adapt-ed to our pre-sent pur-pose nev-er-the-less de-serves men-tion on other ac-coun-ts It is a qui-et noon scene among the isles of the Pa-cif-ic a French whaler an-chored in-shore in a calm and lazi-ly tak-ing water on board the loos-ened sails of the ship and the long leaves of the palms in the back-ground both droop-ing to-geth-er in the breeze-less air The ef-fect is very fine when con-sid-ered with ref-er-ence to its pre-sent-ing the hardy fish-er-men un-der one of their few aspec-ts of ori-en-tal re-pose The other en-grav-ing is quite a dif-fer-ent af-fair the ship hove to upon the open sea and in the very heart of the Le-viathanic life with a Right Whale along-side the ves-sel in the act of cut-ting in hove over to the mon-ster as if to a quay and a boat hur-ried-ly push-ing off from this scene of ac-tiv-i-ty is about giv-ing chase to whales in the dis-tance The har-poons and lances lie lev-elled for use three oars-men are just set-ting the mast in its hole while from a sud-den roll of the sea the lit-tle craft stands half erect out of the water like a rear-ing horse From the ship the smoke of the tor-men-ts of the boil-ing whale is go-ing up like the smoke over a vil-lage of smithies and to wind-ward a black cloud ris-ing up with earnest of squal-ls and rains seems to quick-en the ac-tiv-i-ty of the ex-cit-ed sea-men CHAPTER 57 Of Whales in Paint in Teeth in Wood in Sheet Iron in Stone in Moun-tains in Stars On Tow-er hill as you go down to the Lon-don docks you may have seen a crip-pled beg-gar or kedger as the sailors say hold-ing a paint-ed board be-fore him rep-re-sent-ing the trag-ic scene in which he lost his leg There are three whales and three boats and one of the boats pre-sumed to con-tain the miss-ing leg in all its orig-i-nal in-tegri-ty is be-ing crunched by the jaws of the fore-most whale Any time th-ese ten years they tell me has that man held up that pic-ture and ex-hib-it-ed that stump to an in-cred-u-lous world But the time of his jus-ti-fi-ca-tion has now come His three whales are as good whales as were ever pub-lished in Wap-ping at any rate and his stump as un-ques-tion-able a stump as any you will find in the western clear-ings But though for ever mount-ed on that stump nev-er a stump speech does the poor whale-man make but with down-cast eyes stands rue-ful-ly con-tem-plat-ing his own am-pu-ta-tion Through-out the Pa-cif-ic and al-so in Nan-tuck-et and New Bed-ford and Sag Har-bor you will come across live-ly sketch-es of whales and whal-ing scenes graven by the fish-er-men them-selves on Sperm Whale teeth or ladiesâ busks wrought out of the Right Whale bone and other like skrimshan-der ar-ti-cles as the whale-men call the numer-ous lit-tle in-ge-nious con-trivances they elab-o-rate-ly carve out of the rough ma-te-ri-al in their hours of ocean leisure Some of them have lit-tle box-es of den-tis-ti-cal look-ing im-ple-men-ts spe-cial-ly in-tend-ed for the skrimshan-der-ing busi-ness But in gen-er-al they toil with their jack knives alone and with that al-most om-nipo-tent tool of the sailor they will turn you out any-thing you please in the way of a marinerâ s fan-cy Long ex-ile from Chris-ten-dom and civ-i-liza-tion inevitably re-stores a man to that con-di-tion in which God placed him i e what is called sav-agery Your true whale hunter is as much a sav-age as an Iro-quois I my-self am a sav-age own-ing no al-le-giance but to the King of the Can-ni-bals and ready at any mo-ment to rebel against him Now one of the pe-cu-liar char-ac-ter-is-tics of the sav-age in his do-mes-tic hours is his won-der-ful pa-tience of in-dus-try An an-cient Hawai-ian war club or spear pad-dle in its full mul-ti-plic-i-ty and elab-o-ra-tion of carv-ing is as great a tro-phy of hu-man per-se-ver-ance as a Latin lex-i-con For with but a bit of bro-ken sea shell or a sharkâ s tooth that mirac-u-lous in-tri-ca-cy of wood-en net work has been achieved and it has cost steady years of steady ap-pli-ca-tion As with the Hawai-ian sav-age so with the white sailor sav-age With the same marvel-lous pa-tience and with the same sin-gle sharkâ s tooth of his one poor jack knife he will carve you a bit of bone sculp-ture not quite as work-man-like but as close packed in its mazi-ness of de-sign as the Greek sav-age Achillesâ s shield and full of bar-bar-ic spir-it and sugges-tive-ness as the prin-ts of that fine old Dutch sav-age Al-bert Durer Wood-en whales or whales cut in pro-file out of the small dark slabs of the noble South Sea war wood are fre-quent-ly met with in the fore-cas-tles of Amer-i-can whalers Some of them are done with much ac-cu-ra-cy At some old gable roofed coun-try hous-es you will see brass whales hung by the tail for knock-ers to the road side door When the porter is sleepy the anvil head-ed whale would be best But th-ese knock-ing whales are sel-dom re-mark-able as faith-ful es-says On the spires of some old fash-ioned church-es you will see sheet iron whales placed there for weather cocks but they are so el-e-vat-ed and be-sides that are to all in-ten-ts and pur-pos-es so la-belled with â Hands off â you can-not ex-am-ine them close-ly enough to de-cide upon their mer-it In bony rib-by re-gions of the earth where at the base of high bro-ken cliffs mass-es of rock lie strewn in fan-tas-tic group-ings upon the plain you will often dis-cov-er images as of the pet-ri-fied for-ms of the Le-viathan part-ly merged in grass which of a windy day breaks against them in a surf of green surges Then again in moun-tain-ous coun-tries where the trav-eller is con-tin-u-al-ly gir-dled by am-phithe-atri-cal heights here and there from some lucky point of view you will catch pass-ing glimpses of the pro-files of whales de-fined along the un-du-lat-ing ridges But you must be a thor-ough whale-man to see th-ese sights and not on-ly that but if you wish to re-turn to such a sight again you must be sure and take the ex-act in-ter-sect-ing lat-i-tude and lon-gi-tude of your first stand point else so chance like are such ob-ser-va-tions of the hil-ls that your pre-cise pre-vi-ous stand point would re-quire a la-bo-ri-ous re dis-cov-ery like the Solo-ma Is-lands which still re-main incog-ni-ta though once high ruffed Men-dan-na trod them and old Figuera chron-i-cled them Nor when ex-pand-ing-ly lift-ed by your sub-ject can you fail to trace out great whales in the star-ry heav-ens and boats in pur-suit of them as when long filled with thoughts of war the Eastern na-tions saw ar-mies locked in bat-tle among the clouds Thus at the North have I chased Le-viathan round and round the Pole with the revo-lu-tions of the bright poin-ts that first de-fined him to me And be-neath the ef-ful-gent Antarc-tic skies I have board-ed the Ar-go Navis and joined the chase against the star-ry Ce-tus far beyond the ut-most stretch of Hy-drus and the Fly-ing Fish With a fri-gateâ s an-chors for my bri-dle bit-ts and fasces of har-poons for spurs would I could mount that whale and leap the top-most skies to see whether the fabled heav-ens with all their count-less ten-ts real-ly lie en-camped beyond my mor-tal sight CHAPTER 58 Brit Steer-ing north east-ward from the Crozetts we fell in with vast mead-ows of brit the minute yel-low sub-stance upon which the Right Whale large-ly feeds For leagues and leagues it un-du-lat-ed round us so that we seemed to be sail-ing through bound-less fields of ripe and gold-en wheat On the se-cond day num-bers of Right Whales were seen who se-cure from the at-tack of a Sperm Whaler like the Pe-quod with open jaws slug-gish-ly swam through the brit which ad-her-ing to the fring-ing fi-bres of that won-drous Vene-tian blind in their mouths was in that man-ner separat-ed from the water that es-caped at the lip As morn-ing mow-ers who side by side slow-ly and seething-ly ad-vance their scythes through the long wet grass of marshy meads even so th-ese mon-sters swam mak-ing a strange grassy cut-ting sound and leav-ing be-hind them end-less swaths of blue upon the yel-low sea That part of the sea known among whale-men as the â Brazil Banksâ does not bear that name as the Banks of New-found-land do be-cause of there be-ing shal-lows and sound-ings there but be-cause of this re-mark-able mead-ow like ap-pear-ance caused by the vast drifts of brit con-tin-u-al-ly float-ing in those lat-i-tudes where the Right Whale is often chased But it was on-ly the sound they made as they part-ed the brit which at all re-mind-ed one of mow-ers Seen from the mast heads espe-cial-ly when they paused and were sta-tion-ary for a while their vast black for-ms looked more like life-less mass-es of rock than any-thing else And as in the great hunt-ing coun-tries of In-dia the stranger at a dis-tance will some-times pass on the plains re-cum-bent ele-phan-ts without know-ing them to be such tak-ing them for bare black-ened el-e-va-tions of the soil even so often with him who for the first time be-holds this species of the le-viathans of the sea And even when recog-nised at last their im-mense mag-ni-tude ren-ders it very hard real-ly to believe that such bulky mass-es of over-growth can pos-si-bly be in-stinct in all parts with the same sort of life that lives in a dog or a horse In-deed in other re-spec-ts you can hard-ly re-gard any crea-tures of the deep with the same feel-ings that you do those of the shore For though some old nat-u-ral-ists have main-tained that all crea-tures of the land are of their kind in the sea and though tak-ing a broad gen-er-al view of the thing this may very well be yet com-ing to spe-cial-ties where for ex-am-ple does the ocean fur-nish any fish that in dis-po-si-tion an-swers to the sa-ga-cious kind-ness of the dog The ac-cursed shark alone can in any gener-ic re-spect be said to bear com-par-a-tive anal-o-gy to him But though to lands-men in gen-er-al the na-tive in-hab-i-tan-ts of the seas have ever been re-gard-ed with emo-tions un-speak-ably unso-cial and re-pelling though we know the sea to be an ever-last-ing ter-ra incog-ni-ta so that Colum-bus sailed over num-ber-less un-known worlds to dis-cov-er his one su-per-fi-cial western one though by vast od-ds the most ter-rif-ic of all mor-tal disas-ters have im-memo-ri-al-ly and indis-crim-i-nate-ly be-fall-en tens and hun-dreds of thou-sands of those who have gone upon the waters though but a mo-men-tâ s con-sid-er-a-tion will teach that how-ev-er ba-by man may brag of his science and skill and how-ev-er much in a flat-ter-ing fu-ture that science and skill may aug-ment yet for ever and for ever to the crack of doom the sea will in-sult and mur-der him and pul-ver-ize the stateliest stiffest fri-gate he can make nev-er-the-less by the con-tin-u-al rep-e-ti-tion of th-ese very im-pres-sions man has lost that sense of the full aw-ful-ness of the sea which abo-rig-i-nal-ly be-longs to it The first boat we read of float-ed on an ocean that with Por-tuguese vengeance had whelmed a whole world without leav-ing so much as a wi-d-ow That same ocean rol-ls now that same ocean de-stroyed the wrecked ships of last year Yea fool-ish mor-tals Noahâ s flood is not yet sub-sid-ed two thirds of the fair world it yet covers Where-in dif-fer the sea and the land that a mir-a-cle upon one is not a mir-a-cle upon the other Preter-nat-u-ral ter-rors rest-ed upon the He-brews when un-der the feet of Ko-rah and his com-pa-ny the live ground opened and swal-lowed them up for ever yet not a modern sun ever sets but in pre-cise-ly the same man-ner the live sea swal-lows up ships and crews But not on-ly is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it but it is al-so a fiend to its own off spring worse than the Per-sian host who mur-dered his own guests spar-ing not the crea-tures which it-self hath spawned Like a sav-age ti-gress that toss-ing in the jun-gle over-lays her own cubs so the sea dash-es even the might-i-est whales against the rocks and leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks of ships No mer-cy no pow-er but its own con-trols it Pant-ing and snort-ing like a mad bat-tle steed that has lost its rider the master-less ocean over-runs the globe Con-sid-er the subtle-ness of the sea how its most dread-ed crea-tures glide un-der water unap-par-ent for the most part and treach-er-ous-ly hid-den be-neath the loveli-est tin-ts of azure Con-sid-er al-so the devil-ish bril-liance and beau-ty of many of its most re-morse-less tribes as the dain-ty em-bel-lished shape of many species of sharks Con-sid-er once more the univer-sal can-ni-bal-ism of the sea all whose crea-tures prey upon each other car-ry-ing on eter-nal war since the world be-gan Con-sid-er all this and then turn to this green gen-tle and most docile earth con-sid-er them both the sea and the land and do you not find a strange anal-o-gy to some-thing in your-self For as this ap-palling ocean sur-rounds the ver-dant land so in the soul of man there lies one in-su-lar Tahi-ti full of peace and joy but en-com-passed by all the hor-rors of the half known life God keep thee Push not off from that isle thou canst nev-er re-turn CHAPTER 59 Squid Slow-ly wad-ing through the mead-ows of brit the Pe-quod still held on her way north east-ward towards the is-land of Ja-va a gen-tle air im-pelling her keel so that in the sur-round-ing seren-i-ty her three tall taper-ing masts mild-ly waved to that lan-guid breeze as three mild palms on a plain And still at wide in-ter-vals in the sil-very night the lone-ly al-lur-ing jet would be seen But one trans-par-ent blue morn-ing when a still-ness al-most preter-nat-u-ral spread over the sea how-ev-er unat-tend-ed with any stag-nant calm when the long bur-nished sun glade on the waters seemed a gold-en finger laid across them en-join-ing some se-cre-cy when the slip-pered waves whis-pered to-geth-er as they soft-ly ran on in this pro-found hush of the vis-i-ble sphere a strange spec-tre was seen by Dag-goo from the main mast head In the dis-tance a great white mass lazi-ly rose and ris-ing higher and higher and disen-tan-gling it-self from the azure at last gleamed be-fore our prow like a snow slide new slid from the hil-ls Thus glis-ten-ing for a mo-ment as slow-ly it sub-sid-ed and sank Then once more arose and si-lent-ly gleamed It seemed not a whale and yet is this Mo-by Dick thought Dag-goo Again the phan-tom went down but on re ap-pear-ing once more with a stilet-to like cry that star-tled every man from his nod the ne-gro yelled outâ â There there again there she breach-es right ahead The White Whale the White Whale â Upon this the sea-men rushed to the yard ar-ms as in swarm-ing time the bees rush to the boughs Bare head-ed in the sul-try sun Ahab stood on the bowsprit and with one hand pushed far be-hind in readi-ness to wave his orders to the helms-man cast his eager glance in the direc-tion indi-cat-ed aloft by the out-stretched mo-tion-less arm of Dag-goo Whether the flit-ting at-ten-dance of the one still and soli-tary jet had grad-u-al-ly worked upon Ahab so that he was now pre-pared to con-nect the ideas of mild-ness and re-pose with the first sight of the par-tic-u-lar whale he pur-sued how-ev-er this was or whether his eager-ness be-trayed him whichev-er way it might have been no soon-er did he distinct-ly per-ceive the white mass than with a quick in-ten-si-ty he in-stant-ly gave orders for low-er-ing The four boats were soon on the water Ahabâ s in ad-vance and all swift-ly pulling towards their prey Soon it went down and while with oars sus-pend-ed we were await-ing its reap-pear-ance lo in the same spot where it sank once more it slow-ly rose Al-most for-get-ting for the mo-ment all thoughts of Mo-by Dick we now gazed at the most won-drous phenomenon which the se-cret seas have hither-to re-vealed to mankind A vast pulpy mass fur-longs in length and breadth of a glanc-ing cream colour lay float-ing on the water in-nu-mer-able long ar-ms ra-di-at-ing from its cen-tre and curl-ing and twist-ing like a nest of ana-con-das as if blind-ly to clutch at any hap-less ob-ject within reach No per-cep-ti-ble face or front did it have no con-ceiv-able to-ken of either sen-sa-tion or in-stinct but un-du-lat-ed there on the bil-lows an un-earth-ly form-less chance like ap-pari-tion of life As with a low suck-ing sound it slow-ly dis-ap-peared again Star-buck still gaz-ing at the agi-tat-ed waters where it had sunk with a wild voice ex-claimedâ â Al-most rather had I seen Mo-by Dick and fought him than to have seen thee thou white ghost â â What was it Sir â said Flask â The great live squid which they say few whale ships ever be-held and re-turned to their ports to tell of it â But Ahab said noth-ing turn-ing his boat he sailed back to the ves-sel the rest as si-lent-ly fol-low-ing What-ev-er su-per-sti-tions the sperm whale-men in gen-er-al have con-nect-ed with the sight of this ob-ject cer-tain it is that a glimpse of it be-ing so very unusu-al that cir-cum-stance has gone far to in-vest it with por-ten-tous-ness So rare-ly is it be-held that though one and all of them de-clare it to be the largest an-i-mat-ed thing in the ocean yet very few of them have any but the most vague ideas con-cern-ing its true na-ture and form notwith-stand-ing they believe it to fur-nish to the sperm whale his on-ly food For though other species of whales find their food above water and may be seen by man in the act of feed-ing the sper-ma-ceti whale ob-tains his whole food in un-known zones below the sur-face and on-ly by in-fer-ence is it that any one can tell of what pre-cise-ly that food con-sists At times when close-ly pur-sued he will dis-gorge what are sup-posed to be the de-tached ar-ms of the squid some of them thus ex-hib-it-ed ex-ceed-ing twen-ty and thir-ty feet in length They fan-cy that the mon-ster to which th-ese ar-ms be-longed or-di-nar-i-ly clings by them to the bed of the ocean and that the sperm whale un-like other species is sup-plied with teeth in order to at-tack and tear it There seems some ground to imag-ine that the great Krak-en of Bish-op Pon-top-po-dan may ul-ti-mate-ly re-solve it-self in-to Squid The man-ner in which the Bish-op de-scribes it as al-ter-nate-ly ris-ing and sink-ing with some other par-tic-u-lars he nar-rates in all this the two cor-re-spond But much abate-ment is ne-c-es-sary with re-spect to the in-cred-i-ble bulk he as-signs it By some nat-u-ral-ists who have vague-ly heard ru-mors of the mys-te-ri-ous crea-ture here spo-ken of it is in-clud-ed among the class of cut-tle fish to which in-deed in cer-tain ex-ter-nal re-spec-ts it would seem to be-long but on-ly as the Anak of the tribe CHAPTER 6 The Line With ref-er-ence to the whal-ing scene short-ly to be de-scribed as well as for the bet-ter un-der-stand-ing of all sim-i-lar scenes else-where pre-sent-ed I have here to speak of the mag-i-cal some-times hor-ri-ble whale line The line orig-i-nal-ly used in the fish-ery was of the best hemp slight-ly va-pored with tar not im-preg-nat-ed with it as in the case of or-di-nary ropes for while tar as or-di-nar-i-ly used makes the hemp more pli-able to the rope mak-er and al-so ren-ders the rope it-self more con-ve-nient to the sailor for com-mon ship use yet not on-ly would the or-di-nary quan-ti-ty too much stiff-en the whale line for the close coil-ing to which it must be sub-ject-ed but as most sea-men are begin-ning to learn tar in gen-er-al by no means ad-ds to the ropeâ s dura-bil-i-ty or strength how-ev-er much it may give it com-pact-ness and gloss Of late years the Manil-la rope has in the Amer-i-can fish-ery al-most en-tire-ly su-per-seded hemp as a ma-te-ri-al for whale lines for though not so durable as hemp it is stronger and far more soft and elas-tic and I will add since there is an Ã sthet-ics in all things is much more hand-some and be-com-ing to the boat than hemp Hemp is a dusky dark fel-low a sort of In-di-an but Manil-la is as a gold-en haired Cir-cas-sian to be-hold The whale line is on-ly two thirds of an inch in thick-ness At first sight you would not think it so strong as it real-ly is By ex-per-i-ment its one and fifty yarns will each sus-pend a weight of one hun-dred and twen-ty pounds so that the whole rope will bear a strain near-ly equal to three tons In length the com-mon sperm whale line mea-sures some-thing over two hun-dred fath-oms Towards the stern of the boat it is spi-ral-ly coiled away in the tub not like the worm pipe of a still though but so as to form one round cheese shaped mass of dense-ly bed-ded â sheaves â or lay-ers of con-cen-tric spi-ral-iza-tions without any hol-low but the â heart â or minute ver-ti-cal tube formed at the ax-is of the cheese As the least tan-gle or kink in the coil-ing would in run-ning out in-fal-li-bly take some-bodyâ s arm leg or en-tire body off the ut-most pre-cau-tion is used in stow-ing the line in its tub Some har-pooneers will con-sume al-most an en-tire morn-ing in this busi-ness car-ry-ing the line high aloft and then reev-ing it down-wards through a block towards the tub so as in the act of coil-ing to free it from all pos-si-ble wrin-kles and twists In the English boats two tubs are used in-stead of one the same line be-ing con-tin-u-ous-ly coiled in both tubs There is some ad-van-tage in this be-cause th-ese twin tubs be-ing so small they fit more read-i-ly in-to the boat and do not strain it so much where-as the Amer-i-can tub near-ly three feet in di-am-e-ter and of pro-por-tion-ate depth makes a rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but one half inch in thick-ness for the bot-tom of the whale boat is like crit-i-cal ice which will bear up a con-sid-er-able distribut-ed weight but not very much of a con-cen-trat-ed one When the paint-ed can-vas cover is clapped on the Amer-i-can line tub the boat looks as if it were pulling off with a prodi-gious great wed-ding cake to pre-sent to the whales Both ends of the line are ex-posed the low-er end ter-mi-nat-ing in an eye splice or loop com-ing up from the bot-tom against the side of the tub and hang-ing over its edge com-plete-ly disen-gaged from every-thing This ar-range-ment of the low-er end is ne-c-es-sary on two ac-coun-ts First In order to fa-cil-i-tate the fas-ten-ing to it of an ad-di-tion-al line from a neigh-bor-ing boat in case the strick-en whale should sound so deep as to threat-en to car-ry off the en-tire line orig-i-nal-ly at-tached to the har-poon In th-ese in-stances the whale of course is shift-ed like a mug of ale as it were from the one boat to the other though the first boat al-ways hovers at hand to as-sist its con-sort Se-cond This ar-range-ment is indis-pens-able for com-mon safe-tyâ s sake for were the low-er end of the line in any way at-tached to the boat and were the whale then to run the line out to the end al-most in a sin-gle smok-ing minute as he some-times does he would not stop there for the doomed boat would in-fal-li-bly be dragged down after him in-to the pro-fun-di-ty of the sea and in that case no town cri-er would ever find her again Be-fore low-er-ing the boat for the chase the up-per end of the line is tak-en aft from the tub and pass-ing round the log-ger-head there is again car-ried for-ward the en-tire length of the boat rest-ing cross-wise upon the loom or han-dle of every manâ s oar so that it jogs against his wrist in row-ing and al-so pass-ing between the men as they al-ter-nate-ly sit at the op-po-site gun-wales to the lead-ed chocks or grooves in the ex-treme point-ed prow of the boat where a wood-en pin or skew-er the size of a com-mon quill preven-ts it from slip-ping out From the chocks it hangs in a slight festoon over the bows and is then passed in-side the boat again and some ten or twen-ty fath-oms called box line be-ing coiled upon the box in the bows it con-tin-ues its way to the gun-wale still a lit-tle fur-ther aft and is then at-tached to the short warpâ the rope which is im-me-di-ate-ly con-nect-ed with the har-poon but pre-vi-ous to that con-nex-ion the short warp goes through sundry mys-ti-fi-ca-tions too te-dious to de-tail Thus the whale line folds the whole boat in its com-pli-cat-ed coils twist-ing and writhing around it in al-most every direc-tion All the oars-men are in-volved in its per-ilous con-tor-tions so that to the timid eye of the lands-man they seem as In-di-an jug-glers with the dead-li-est snakes sportive-ly festoon-ing their lim-bs Nor can any son of mor-tal wo-man for the first time seat him-self amid those hem-pen in-tri-ca-cies and while strain-ing his ut-most at the oar be-think him that at any un-known in-stant the har-poon may be dart-ed and all th-ese hor-ri-ble con-tor-tions be put in play like ringed light-nings he can-not be thus cir-cum-stanced without a shud-der that makes the very mar-row in his bones to quiver in him like a shak-en jel-ly Yet habitâ strange thing what can-not habit ac-com-plish â Gay-er sal-lies more mer-ry mirth bet-ter jokes and brighter repar-tees you nev-er heard over your ma-hogany than you will hear over the half inch white cedar of the whale boat when thus hung in hang-manâ s noos-es and like the six burghers of Calais be-fore King Ed-ward the six men com-pos-ing the crew pull in-to the jaws of death with a hal-ter around every neck as you may say Per-haps a very lit-tle thought will now en-able you to ac-count for those re-peat-ed whal-ing disas-ter-sâ some few of which are ca-su-al-ly chron-i-cledâ of this man or that man be-ing tak-en out of the boat by the line and lost For when the line is dart-ing out to be seat-ed then in the boat is like be-ing seat-ed in the midst of the man-i-fold whizzings of a steam engine in full play when every fly-ing beam and shaft and wheel is graz-ing you It is worse for you can-not sit mo-tion-less in the heart of th-ese per-ils be-cause the boat is rock-ing like a cra-dle and you are pitched one way and the other without the slight-est warn-ing and on-ly by a cer-tain self ad-just-ing buoy-an-cy and si-mul-ta-ne-ous-ness of vo-li-tion and ac-tion can you es-cape be-ing made a Mazep-pa of and run away with where the all see-ing sun him-self could nev-er pierce you out Again as the pro-found calm which on-ly ap-par-ent-ly pre-cedes and proph-e-sies of the storm is per-haps more aw-ful than the storm it-self for in-deed the calm is but the wrap-per and en-ve-lope of the storm and con-tains it in it-self as the seem-ing-ly harm-less ri-fle holds the fatal pow-der and the ball and the ex-plo-sion so the grace-ful re-pose of the line as it si-lent-ly ser-pen-tines about the oars-men be-fore be-ing brought in-to ac-tu-al playâ this is a thing which car-ries more of true ter-ror than any other aspect of this danger-ous af-fair But why say more All men live en-veloped in whale lines All are born with hal-ters round their necks but it is on-ly when caught in the swift sud-den turn of death that mor-tals real-ize the si-lent sub-tle ever pre-sent per-ils of life And if you be a philoso-pher though seat-ed in the whale boat you would not at heart feel one whit more of ter-ror than though seat-ed be-fore your even-ing fire with a pok-er and not a har-poon by your side CHAPTER 61 Stubb Kil-ls a Whale If to Star-buck the ap-pari-tion of the Squid was a thing of por-ten-ts to Quee-queg it was quite a dif-fer-ent ob-ject â When you see him â quid â said the sav-age hon-ing his har-poon in the bow of his hoist-ed boat â then you quick see him â parm whale â The next day was ex-ceed-ing-ly still and sul-try and with noth-ing spe-cial to en-gage them the Pe-quodâ s crew could hard-ly re-sist the spell of sleep in-duced by such a va-cant sea For this part of the In-di-an Ocean through which we then were voy-ag-ing is not what whale-men call a live-ly ground that is it af-fords few-er glimpses of por-pois-es dol-phins fly-ing fish and other vi-va-cious denizens of more stir-ring waters than those off the Rio de la Pla-ta or the in shore ground off Peru It was my turn to stand at the fore-mast head and with my shoul-ders lean-ing against the slack-ened roy-al shrouds to and fro I id-ly swayed in what seemed an en-chant-ed air No res-o-lu-tion could with-stand it in that dreamy mood los-ing all con-scious-ness at last my soul went out of my body though my body still con-tin-ued to sway as a pen-du-lum will long after the pow-er which first moved it is with-drawn Ere for-get-ful-ness al-to-geth-er came over me I had no-ticed that the sea-men at the main and mizzen mast heads were al-ready drowsy So that at last all three of us life-less-ly swung from the spars and for every swing that we made there was a nod from below from the slum-ber-ing helms-man The waves too nod-ded their in-do-lent crests and across the wide trance of the sea east nod-ded to west and the sun over all Sud-den-ly bub-bles seemed burst-ing be-neath my closed eyes like vices my hands grasped the shrouds some in-vis-i-ble gra-cious agen-cy pre-served me with a shock I came back to life And lo close un-der our lee not forty fath-oms off a gi-gan-tic Sperm Whale lay rolling in the water like the cap-sized hull of a fri-gate his broad glossy back of an Ethiopi-an hue glis-ten-ing in the sunâ s rays like a mir-ror But lazi-ly un-du-lat-ing in the trough of the sea and ever and anon tran-quil-ly spout-ing his va-pory jet the whale looked like a port-ly burgher smok-ing his pipe of a warm after-noon But that pipe poor whale was thy last As if struck by some en-chanterâ s wand the sleepy ship and every sleep-er in it all at once start-ed in-to wake-ful-ness and more than a score of voic-es from all parts of the ves-sel si-mul-ta-ne-ous-ly with the three notes from aloft shout-ed forth the ac-cus-tomed cry as the great fish slow-ly and reg-u-lar-ly spout-ed the sparkling brine in-to the air â Clear away the boats Luff â cried Ahab And obey-ing his own order he dashed the helm down be-fore the helms-man could han-dle the spokes The sud-den ex-cla-ma-tions of the crew must have alarmed the whale and ere the boats were down ma-jes-ti-cal-ly turn-ing he swam away to the lee-ward but with such a steady tran-quil-li-ty and mak-ing so few rip-ples as he swam that think-ing after all he might not as yet be alarmed Ahab gave orders that not an oar should be used and no man must speak but in whis-pers So seat-ed like On-tario In-di-ans on the gun-wales of the boats we swift-ly but si-lent-ly pad-dled along the calm not ad-mit-ting of the noise-less sails be-ing set Present-ly as we thus glid-ed in chase the mon-ster per-pen-dic-u-lar-ly flit-ted his tail forty feet in-to the air and then sank out of sight like a tow-er swal-lowed up â There go flukes â was the cry an an-nounce-ment im-me-di-ate-ly fol-lowed by Stub-bâ s pro-duc-ing his match and ig-nit-ing his pipe for now a re-spite was grant-ed After the full in-ter-val of his sound-ing had elapsed the whale rose again and be-ing now in ad-vance of the smok-erâ s boat and much nearer to it than to any of the others Stubb count-ed upon the honor of the cap-ture It was ob-vi-ous now that the whale had at length be-come aware of his pur-suers All si-lence of cau-tious-ness was there-fore no longer of use Pad-dles were dropped and oars came loud-ly in-to play And still puff-ing at his pipe Stubb cheered on his crew to the as-sault Yes a mighty change had come over the fish All alive to his jeop-ardy he was go-ing â head outâ that part oblique-ly pro-ject-ing from the mad yeast which he brewed It will be seen in some other place of what a very light sub-stance the en-tire in-te-ri-or of the sperm whaleâ s enor-mous head con-sists Though ap-par-ent-ly the most mas-sive it is by far the most buoy-ant part about him So that with ease he el-e-vates it in the air and in-vari-ably does so when go-ing at his ut-most speed Be-sides such is the breadth of the up-per part of the front of his head and such the taper-ing cut water for-ma-tion of the low-er part that by oblique-ly el-e-vat-ing his head he there-by may be said to trans-form him-self from a bluff bowed slug-gish gal-liot in-to a sharp-point-ed New York pilot boat â Start her start her my men Donâ t hur-ry your-selves take plen-ty of timeâ but start her start her like thun-der claps thatâ s all â cried Stubb splut-ter-ing out the smoke as he spoke â Start her now give â em the long and strong stroke Tashtego Start her Tash my boyâ start her all but keep cool keep coolâ cu-cum-bers is the wordâ easy easyâ on-ly start her like grim death and grin-ning devils and raise the buried dead per-pen-dic-u-lar out of their graves boysâ thatâ s all Start her â â Woo hoo Wa hee â screamed the Gay Head-er in re-ply rais-ing some old war whoop to the skies as every oars-man in the strained boat in-vol-un-tar-i-ly bounced for-ward with the one tre-men-dous lead-ing stroke which the eager In-di-an gave But his wild screams were an-swered by others quite as wild â Kee hee Kee hee â yelled Dag-goo strain-ing for-wards and back-wards on his seat like a pac-ing tiger in his cage â Ka la Koo loo â howled Quee-queg as if smack-ing his lips over a mouth-ful of Gre-nadierâ s steak And thus with oars and yel-ls the keels cut the sea Mean-while Stubb re-tain-ing his place in the van still en-cour-aged his men to the onset all the while puff-ing the smoke from his mouth Like des-per-a-does they tugged and they strained till the wel-come cry was heardâ â Stand up Tashtego â give it to him â The har-poon was hurled â Stern all â The oars-men backed water the same mo-ment some-thing went hot and hiss-ing along every one of their wrists It was the mag-i-cal line An in-stant be-fore Stubb had swift-ly caught two ad-di-tion-al turns with it round the log-ger-head whence by rea-son of its in-creased rapid cir-clings a hem-pen blue smoke now jet-ted up and min-gled with the steady fumes from his pipe As the line passed round and round the log-ger-head so al-so just be-fore reach-ing that point it blis-ter-ing-ly passed through and through both of Stub-bâ s hands from which the hand cloths or squares of quilt-ed can-vas some-times worn at th-ese times had ac-ci-den-tal-ly dropped It was like hold-ing an ene-myâ s sharp two edged sword by the blade and that ene-my all the time striv-ing to wrest it out of your clutch â Wet the line wet the line â cried Stubb to the tub oars-man him seat-ed by the tub who snatch-ing off his hat dashed sea water in-to it More turns were tak-en so that the line be-gan hold-ing its place The boat now flew through the boil-ing water like a shark all fins Stubb and Tashtego here changed placesâ stem for sternâ a stag-ger-ing busi-ness tru-ly in that rock-ing com-mo-tion Part-ly to show the indis-pens-able-ness of this act it may here be stat-ed that in the old Dutch fish-ery a mop was used to dash the run-ning line with water in many other ships a wood-en pig-gin or bail-er is set apart for that pur-pose Your hat how-ev-er is the most con-ve-nient From the vi-brat-ing line ex-tend-ing the en-tire length of the up-per part of the boat and from its now be-ing more tight than a harp-string you would have thought the craft had two keel-sâ one cleav-ing the water the other the airâ as the boat churned on through both op-pos-ing ele-men-ts at once A con-tin-u-al cas-cade played at the bows a cease-less whirling ed-dy in her wake and at the slight-est mo-tion from within even but of a lit-tle finger the vi-brat-ing crack-ing craft cant-ed over her spas-mod-ic gun-wale in-to the sea Thus they rushed each man with might and main cling-ing to his seat to prevent be-ing tossed to the foam and the tall form of Tashtego at the steer-ing oar crouch-ing al-most dou-ble in order to bring down his cen-tre of grav-i-ty Whole At-lantics and Pacifics seemed passed as they shot on their way till at length the whale some-what slack-ened his flight â Haul inâ haul in â cried Stubb to the bows-man and fac-ing round towards the whale all hands be-gan pulling the boat up to him while yet the boat was be-ing towed on Soon rang-ing up by his flank Stubb firm-ly plant-ing his knee in the clum-sy cleat dart-ed dart after dart in-to the fly-ing fish at the word of com-mand the boat al-ter-nate-ly stern-ing out of the way of the whaleâ s hor-ri-ble wal-low and then rang-ing up for another fling The red tide now poured from all sides of the mon-ster like brooks down a hill His tor-ment-ed body rolled not in brine but in blood which bub-bled and seethed for fur-longs be-hind in their wake The slant-ing sun play-ing upon this crim-son pond in the sea sent back its re-flec-tion in-to every face so that they all glowed to each other like red men And all the while jet after jet of white smoke was ago-niz-ing-ly shot from the spir-a-cle of the whale and ve-he-ment puff after puff from the mouth of the ex-cit-ed heads-man as at every dart haul-ing in upon his crooked lance by the line at-tached to it Stubb straight-ened it again and again by a few rapid blows against the gun-wale then again and again sent it in-to the whale â Pull upâ pull up â he now cried to the bows-man as the wan-ing whale re-laxed in his wrath â Pull up â close to â and the boat ranged along the fishâ s flank When reach-ing far over the bow Stubb slow-ly churned his long sharp lance in-to the fish and kept it there care-ful-ly churn-ing and churn-ing as if cau-tious-ly seek-ing to feel after some gold watch that the whale might have swal-lowed and which he was fear-ful of break-ing ere he could hook it out But that gold watch he sought was the in-ner-most life of the fish And now it is struck for start-ing from his trance in-to that un-speak-able thing called his â flur-ry â the mon-ster hor-ri-bly wal-lowed in his blood over-wrapped him-self in im-pen-e-tra-ble mad boil-ing spray so that the im-per-illed craft in-stant-ly drop-ping astern had much ado blind-ly to strug-gle out from that phren-sied twi-light in-to the clear air of the day And now abat-ing in his flur-ry the whale once more rolled out in-to view surg-ing from side to side spas-mod-i-cal-ly di-lat-ing and con-tract-ing his spout hole with sharp crack-ing ago-nized re-s-pi-ra-tions At last gush after gush of clot-ted red gore as if it had been the pur-ple lees of red wine shot in-to the fright-ed air and falling back again ran drip-ping down his mo-tion-less flanks in-to the sea His heart had burst â Heâ s dead Mr Stubb â said Dag-goo â Yes both pipes smoked out â and with-draw-ing his own from his mouth Stubb scat-tered the dead ash-es over the water and for a mo-ment stood thought-ful-ly eye-ing the vast corpse he had made CHAPTER 62 The Dart A word con-cern-ing an in-ci-dent in the last chap-ter Ac-cord-ing to the in-vari-able usage of the fish-ery the whale boat push-es off from the ship with the heads-man or whale killer as tem-po-rary steers-man and the har-pooneer or whale fas-ten-er pulling the fore-most oar the one known as the har-pooneer oar Now it needs a strong ner-vous arm to strike the first iron in-to the fish for often in what is called a long dart the heavy im-ple-ment has to be flung to the dis-tance of twen-ty or thir-ty feet But how-ev-er pro-longed and ex-haust-ing the chase the har-pooneer is ex-pect-ed to pull his oar mean-while to the ut-ter-most in-deed he is ex-pect-ed to set an ex-am-ple of su-per-hu-man ac-tiv-i-ty to the rest not on-ly by in-cred-i-ble row-ing but by re-peat-ed loud and in-trepid ex-cla-ma-tions and what it is to keep shout-ing at the top of oneâ s com-pass while all the other mus-cles are strained and half start-edâ what that is none know but those who have tried it For one I can-not bawl very hearti-ly and work very reck-less-ly at one and the same time In this strain-ing bawl-ing state then with his back to the fish all at once the ex-haust-ed har-pooneer hears the ex-cit-ing cryâ â Stand up and give it to him â He now has to drop and se-cure his oar turn round on his cen-tre half way seize his har-poon from the crotch and with what lit-tle strength may re-main he es-says to pitch it some-how in-to the whale No won-der tak-ing the whole fleet of whale-men in a body that out of fifty fair chances for a dart not five are suc-cess-ful no won-der that so many hap-less har-pooneers are mad-ly cursed and dis-rat-ed no won-der that some of them ac-tu-al-ly burst their blood ves-sels in the boat no won-der that some sperm whale-men are ab-sent four years with four bar-rels no won-der that to many ship own-ers whal-ing is but a los-ing con-cern for it is the har-pooneer that makes the voy-age and if you take the breath out of his body how can you ex-pect to find it there when most want-ed Again if the dart be suc-cess-ful then at the se-cond crit-i-cal in-stant that is when the whale starts to run the boat-head-er and har-pooneer like-wise start to run-ning fore and aft to the im-mi-nent jeop-ardy of them-selves and every one else It is then they change places and the heads-man the chief of-fi-cer of the lit-tle craft takes his prop-er sta-tion in the bows of the boat Now I care not who main-tains the con-trary but all this is both fool-ish and un-nec-es-sary The heads-man should stay in the bows from first to last he should both dart the har-poon and the lance and no row-ing what-ev-er should be ex-pect-ed of him ex-cept un-der cir-cum-stances ob-vi-ous to any fish-er-man I know that this would some-times in-volve a slight loss of speed in the chase but long ex-pe-ri-ence in var-i-ous whale-men of more than one na-tion has con-vinced me that in the vast ma-jor-i-ty of fail-ures in the fish-ery it has not by any means been so much the speed of the whale as the be-fore de-scribed ex-haus-tion of the har-pooneer that has caused them To in-sure the great-est ef-fi-cien-cy in the dart the har-pooneers of this world must start to their feet from out of idle-ness and not from out of toil CHAPTER 63 The Crotch Out of the trunk the branch-es grow out of them the twigs So in pro-duc-tive sub-jec-ts grow the chap-ters The crotch al-lud-ed to on a pre-vi-ous page de-serves in-de-pen-dent men-tion It is a notched stick of a pe-cu-liar form some two feet in length which is per-pen-dic-u-lar-ly insert-ed in-to the star-board gun-wale near the bow for the pur-pose of fur-nish-ing a rest for the wood-en ex-trem-i-ty of the har-poon whose other naked barbed end slop-ing-ly pro-jec-ts from the prow There-by the weapon is in-stant-ly at hand to its hurler who snatch-es it up as read-i-ly from its rest as a back-woods-man swings his ri-fle from the wall It is cus-tom-ary to have two har-poons re-pos-ing in the crotch re-spec-tive-ly called the first and se-cond irons But th-ese two har-poons each by its own cord are both con-nect-ed with the line the ob-ject be-ing this to dart them both if pos-si-ble one in-stant-ly after the other in-to the same whale so that if in the com-ing drag one should draw out the other may still re-tain a hold It is a dou-bling of the chances But it very often hap-pens that owing to the in-stan-ta-neous vi-o-lent con-vul-sive run-ning of the whale upon re-ceiv-ing the first iron it be-comes im-pos-si-ble for the har-pooneer how-ev-er light-ning like in his move-men-ts to pitch the se-cond iron in-to him Nev-er-the-less as the se-cond iron is al-ready con-nect-ed with the line and the line is run-ning hence that weapon must at all even-ts be an-tic-i-pat-ing-ly tossed out of the boat some-how and some-where else the most ter-ri-ble jeop-ardy would in-volve all hands Tum-bled in-to the water it ac-cord-ing-ly is in such cas-es the spare coils of box line men-tioned in a pre-ced-ing chap-ter mak-ing this feat in most in-stances pru-dent-ly prac-ti-ca-ble But this crit-i-cal act is not al-ways unat-tend-ed with the sad-dest and most fatal ca-su-al-ties Fur-ther-more you must know that when the se-cond iron is thrown over-board it thence-forth be-comes a dan-gling sharp edged ter-ror skit-tish-ly curvet-ting about both boat and whale en-tan-gling the lines or cut-ting them and mak-ing a prodi-gious sen-sa-tion in all direc-tions Nor in gen-er-al is it pos-si-ble to se-cure it again un-til the whale is fair-ly cap-tured and a corpse Con-sid-er now how it must be in the case of four boats all en-gag-ing one unusu-al-ly strong ac-tive and know-ing whale when owing to th-ese qual-i-ties in him as well as to the thou-sand con-cur-ring ac-ci-den-ts of such an au-da-cious en-ter-prise eight or ten loose se-cond irons may be si-mul-ta-ne-ous-ly dan-gling about him For of course each boat is sup-plied with sev-er-al har-poons to bend on to the line should the first one be in-ef-fec-tu-al-ly dart-ed without re-cov-ery All th-ese par-tic-u-lars are faith-ful-ly nar-rat-ed here as they will not fail to elu-ci-date sev-er-al most im-por-tant how-ev-er in-tri-cate pas-sages in scenes hereafter to be paint-ed CHAPTER 64 Stub-bâ s Sup-per Stub-bâ s whale had been killed some dis-tance from the ship It was a calm so form-ing a tan-dem of three boats we com-menced the slow busi-ness of tow-ing the tro-phy to the Pe-quod And now as we eigh-teen men with our thir-ty six ar-ms and one hun-dred and eighty thum-bs and fingers slow-ly toiled hour after hour upon that in-ert slug-gish corpse in the sea and it seemed hard-ly to budge at all ex-cept at long in-ter-vals good ev-i-dence was here-by fur-nished of the enor-mous-ness of the mass we moved For upon the great canal of Hang Ho or what-ev-er they call it in Chi-na four or five la-bor-ers on the foot path will draw a bulky freight-ed junk at the rate of a mile an hour but this grand ar-gosy we towed heav-i-ly forged along as if laden with pig lead in bulk Dark-ness came on but three lights up and down in the Pe-quodâ s main rig-ging dim-ly guid-ed our way till draw-ing nearer we saw Ahab drop-ping one of sev-er-al more lan-terns over the bul-warks Va-cant-ly eye-ing the heav-ing whale for a mo-ment he is-sued the usu-al orders for se-cur-ing it for the night and then hand-ing his lan-tern to a sea-man went his way in-to the cabin and did not come for-ward again un-til morn-ing Though in oversee-ing the pur-suit of this whale Cap-tain Ahab had evinced his cus-tom-ary ac-tiv-i-ty to call it so yet now that the crea-ture was dead some vague dis-sat-is-fac-tion or im-pa-tience or de-s-pair seemed work-ing in him as if the sight of that dead body re-mind-ed him that Mo-by Dick was yet to be slain and though a thou-sand other whales were brought to his ship all that would not one jot ad-vance his grand mono-ma-ni-ac ob-ject Very soon you would have thought from the sound on the Pe-quodâ s decks that all hands were prepar-ing to cast an-chor in the deep for heavy chains are be-ing dragged along the deck and thrust rat-tling out of the port holes But by those clank-ing links the vast corpse it-self not the ship is to be moored Tied by the head to the stern and by the tail to the bows the whale now lies with its black hull close to the ves-selâ s and seen through the dark-ness of the night which ob-scured the spars and rig-ging aloft the twoâ ship and whale seemed yoked to-geth-er like colos-sal bul-locks where-of one re-clines while the other re-mains stand-ing A lit-tle item may as well be re-lat-ed here The strongest and most reli-able hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored along-side is by the flukes or tail and as from its greater den-si-ty that part is rel-a-tive-ly heav-ier than any other ex-cept-ing the side fins its flex-i-bil-i-ty even in death caus-es it to sink low be-neath the sur-face so that with the hand you can-not get at it from the boat in order to put the chain round it But this dif-fi-cul-ty is in-ge-nious-ly over-come a small strong line is pre-pared with a wood-en float at its outer end and a weight in its mid-dle while the other end is se-cured to the ship By adroit man-age-ment the wood-en float is made to rise on the other side of the mass so that now hav-ing gir-dled the whale the chain is read-i-ly made to fol-low suit and be-ing slipped along the body is at last locked fast round the smallest part of the tail at the point of junc-tion with its broad flukes or lobes If moody Ahab was now all qui-es-cence at least so far as could be known on deck Stubb his se-cond mate flushed with con-quest be-trayed an unusu-al but still good na-tured ex-cite-ment Such an un-wont-ed bus-tle was he in that the staid Star-buck his of-fi-cial su-pe-ri-or qui-et-ly re-signed to him for the time the sole man-age-ment of af-fairs One small help-ing cause of all this live-li-ness in Stubb was soon made strange-ly man-i-fest Stubb was a high liv-er he was some-what in-tem-per-ate-ly fond of the whale as a fla-vor-ish thing to his palate â A steak a steak ere I sleep You Dag-goo over-board you go and cut me one from his small â Here be it known that though th-ese wild fish-er-men do not as a gen-er-al thing and ac-cord-ing to the great mil-i-tary max-im make the ene-my de-fray the cur-rent ex-pens-es of the war at least be-fore real-iz-ing the pro-ceeds of the voy-age yet now and then you find some of th-ese Nan-tuck-eters who have a gen-uine rel-ish for that par-tic-u-lar part of the Sperm Whale des-ig-nat-ed by Stubb com-pris-ing the taper-ing ex-trem-i-ty of the body About mid-night that steak was cut and cooked and light-ed by two lan-terns of sperm oil Stubb stout-ly stood up to his sper-ma-ceti sup-per at the cap-stan head as if that cap-stan were a side-board Nor was Stubb the on-ly ban-queter on whaleâ s flesh that night Min-gling their mum-blings with his own mas-ti-ca-tions thou-sands on thou-sands of sharks swarm-ing round the dead le-viathan smack-ing-ly feast-ed on its fat-ness The few sleep-ers below in their bunks were often star-tled by the sharp slap-ping of their tails against the hull within a few inch-es of the sleep-er-sâ hearts Peer-ing over the side you could just see them as be-fore you heard them wal-low-ing in the sullen black waters and turn-ing over on their backs as they scooped out huge glob-u-lar pieces of the whale of the big-ness of a hu-man head This par-tic-u-lar feat of the shark seems all but mirac-u-lous How at such an ap-par-ent-ly unas-sail-able sur-face they con-trive to gouge out such sym-met-ri-cal mouth-fuls re-mains a part of the univer-sal prob-lem of all things The mark they thus leave on the whale may best be likened to the hol-low made by a car-pen-ter in coun-ter-sink-ing for a screw Though amid all the smok-ing hor-ror and di-abolism of a sea fight sharks will be seen long-ing-ly gaz-ing up to the shipâ s decks like hun-gry dogs round a table where red meat is be-ing carved ready to bolt down every killed man that is tossed to them and though while the valiant butch-ers over the deck table are thus can-ni-bal-ly carv-ing each otherâ s live meat with carv-ing knives all gild-ed and tas-selled the sharks al-so with their jewel hilt-ed mouths are quar-rel-some-ly carv-ing away un-der the table at the dead meat and though were you to turn the whole af-fair up-side down it would still be pret-ty much the same thing that is to say a shock-ing shark-ish busi-ness enough for all par-ties and though sharks al-so are the in-vari-able outrid-ers of all slave ships cross-ing the At-lantic sys-tem-at-i-cal-ly trot-ting along-side to be handy in case a par-cel is to be car-ried any-where or a dead slave to be de-cent-ly buried and though one or two other like in-stances might be set down touch-ing the set ter-ms places and oc-ca-sions when sharks do most so-cial-ly con-gre-gate and most hi-lar-i-ous-ly feast yet is there no con-ceiv-able time or oc-ca-sion when you will find them in such count-less num-bers and in gay-er or more jovial spir-its than around a dead sperm whale moored by night to a whale-ship at sea If you have nev-er seen that sight then sus-pend your de-ci-sion about the pro-pri-ety of devil wor-ship and the ex-pe-di-en-cy of con-cil-i-at-ing the devil But as yet Stubb heed-ed not the mum-blings of the ban-quet that was go-ing on so nigh him no more than the sharks heed-ed the smack-ing of his own epi-cure-an lips â Cook cook â whereâ s that old Fleece â he cried at length wi-den-ing his legs still fur-ther as if to form a more se-cure base for his sup-per and at the same time dart-ing his fork in-to the dish as if stab-bing with his lance â cook you cook â sail this way cook â The old black not in any very high glee at hav-ing been pre-vi-ous-ly roused from his warm ham-mock at a most unsea-son-able hour came sham-bling along from his gal-ley for like many old blacks there was some-thing the mat-ter with his knee pans which he did not keep well scoured like his other pans this old Fleece as they called him came shuf-fling and limp-ing along as-sist-ing his step with his tongs which after a clum-sy fash-ion were made of straight-ened iron hoops this old Ebony floun-dered along and in obe-di-ence to the word of com-mand came to a dead stop on the op-po-site side of Stub-bâ s side-board when with both hands fold-ed be-fore him and rest-ing on his two legged cane he bowed his arched back still fur-ther over at the same time side-ways in-clin-ing his head so as to bring his best ear in-to play â Cook â said Stubb rapid-ly lift-ing a rather red-dish morsel to his mouth â donâ t you think this steak is rather over-done Youâ ve been beat-ing this steak too much cook itâ s too ten-der Donâ t I al-ways say that to be good a whale steak must be tough There are those sharks now over the side donâ t you see they pre-fer it tough and rare What a shindy they are kick-ing up Cook go and talk to â em tell â em they are wel-come to help them-selves civil-ly and in moder-a-tion but they must keep qui-et Blast me if I can hear my own voice Away cook and de-liv-er my mes-sage Here take this lan-tern â snatch-ing one from his side-board â now then go and preach to â em â Sul-len-ly tak-ing the of-fered lan-tern old Fleece limped across the deck to the bul-warks and then with one hand drop-ping his light low over the sea so as to get a good view of his con-gre-ga-tion with the other hand he solemn-ly flour-ished his tongs and lean-ing far over the side in a mum-bling voice be-gan ad-dress-ing the sharks while Stubb soft-ly crawl-ing be-hind over-heard all that was said â Fel-low crit-ters Iâ se ordered here to say dat you must stop dat dam noise dare You hear Stop dat dam smack-inâ ob de lip Mas-sa Stubb say dat you can fill your dam bel-lies up to de hatch-ings but by Gor you must stop dat dam rack-et â â Cook â here in-ter-posed Stubb ac-com-pa-ny-ing the word with a sud-den slap on the shoul-der â â Cook why damn your eyes you

raised his shrill voice and criedâ â Cussed fel-low crit-ters Kick up de dam-n-d-est row as ever you can fill your damâ bel-lies â till dey bustâ and den die â â Now cook â said Stubb re-sum-ing his sup-per at the cap-stan â stand just where you stood be-fore there over against me and pay par-tic-u-lar at-ten-tion â â All den-tion â said Fleece again stoop-ing over upon his tongs in the de-sired po-si-tion â Well â said Stubb help-ing him-self freely mean-while â I shall now go back to the sub-ject of this steak In the first place how old are you cook â â What dat do wid de â teak â said the old black testi-ly â Si-lence How old are you cook â â â Bout nine-ty dey say â he gloomi-ly mut-tered â And you have lived in this world hard upon one hun-dred years cook and donâ t know yet how to cook a whale steak â rapid-ly bolt-ing another mouth-ful at the last word so that morsel seemed a con-tin-u-a-tion of the ques-tion â Where were you born cook â â â Hind de hatch-way in fer-ry boat goinâ ober de Roanoke â â Born in a fer-ry boat Thatâ s queer too But I want to know what coun-try you were born in cook â â Did-nâ t I say de Roanoke coun-try â he cried sharply â No you did-nâ t cook but Iâ ll tell you what Iâ m com-ing to cook You must go home and be born over again you donâ t know how to cook a whale steak yet â â Bress my soul if I cook noder one â he growled an-gri-ly turn-ing round to depart â Come back cook â here hand me those tongs â now take that bit of steak there and tell me if you think that steak cooked as it should be Take it I sayâ â hold-ing the tongs towards himâ â take it and taste it â Faint-ly smack-ing his withered lips over it for a mo-ment the old ne-gro mut-tered â Best cooked â teak I eber taste joosy ber-ry joosy â â Cook â said Stubb squar-ing him-self once more â do you be-long to the church â â Passed one once in Cape Down â said the old man sul-len-ly â And you have once in your life passed a holy church in Cape Town where you doubt-less over-heard a holy par-son ad-dress-ing his hear-ers as his beloved fel-low crea-tures have you cook And yet you come here and tell me such a dread-ful lie as you did just now eh â said Stubb â Where do you ex-pect to go to cook â â Go to bed ber-ry soon â he mum-bled half turn-ing as he spoke â Avast heave to I mean when you die cook Itâ s an aw-ful ques-tion Now whatâ s your an-swer â â When dis old brack man dies â said the ne-gro slow-ly chang-ing his whole air and de-meanor â he his-self wonâ t go nowhere but some bressed an-gel will come and fetch him â â Fetch him How In a coach and four as they fetched Eli-jah And fetch him where â â Up dere â said Fleece hold-ing his tongs straight over his head and keep-ing it there very solemn-ly â So then you ex-pect to go up in-to our main top do you cook when you are dead But donâ t you know the higher you climb the cold-er it gets Main top eh â â Did-nâ t say dat tâ all â said Fleece again in the sulks â You said up there did-nâ t you and now look your-self and see where your tongs are point-ing But per-haps you ex-pect to get in-to heav-en by crawl-ing through the lub-berâ s hole cook but no no cook you donâ t get there ex-cept you go the reg-u-lar way round by the rig-ging Itâ s a tick-lish busi-ness but must be done or else itâ s no go But none of us are in heav-en yet Drop your tongs cook and hear my orders Do ye hear Hold your hat in one hand and clap tâ other aâ top of your heart when Iâ m giv-ing my orders cook What that your heart there â thatâ s your giz-zard Aloft aloft â thatâ s itâ now you have it Hold it there now and pay at-ten-tion â â All â den-tion â said the old black with both hands placed as de-sired vain-ly wrig-gling his griz-zled head as if to get both ears in front at one and the same time â Well then cook you see this whale steak of yours was so very bad that I have put it out of sight as soon as pos-si-ble you see that donâ t you Well for the fu-ture when you cook another whale steak for my pri-vate table here the cap-stan Iâ ll tell you what to do so as not to spoil it by over-do-ing Hold the steak in one hand and show a live coal to it with the other that done dish it dâ ye hear And now to mor-row cook when we are cut-ting in the fish be sure you stand by to get the tips of his fins have them put in pick-le As for the ends of the flukes have them soused cook There now ye may go â But Fleece had hard-ly got three paces off when he was re-called â Cook give me cut-lets for sup-per to mor-row night in the mid watch Dâ ye hear away you sail then â Hal-loa stop make a bow be-fore you go â Avast heav-ing again Whale bal-ls for break-fastâ donâ t for-get â â Wish by gor whale eat him â stead of him eat whale Iâ m bressed if he ainâ t more of shark dan Mas-sa Shark his-self â mut-tered the old man limp-ing away with which sage ejac-u-la-tion he went to his ham-mock CHAPTER 65 The Whale as a Dish That mor-tal man should feed upon the crea-ture that feeds his lamp and like Stubb eat him by his own light as you may say this seems so out-landish a thing that one must needs go a lit-tle in-to the his-to-ry and phi-los-o-phy of it It is upon record that three cen-turies ago the tongue of the Right Whale was es-teemed a great del-i-ca-cy in France and com-mand-ed large prices there Al-so that in Hen-ry VIIIthâ s time a cer-tain cook of the court ob-tained a hand-some re-ward for in-vent-ing an ad-mirable sauce to be eat-en with bar-bacued por-pois-es which you re-mem-ber are a species of whale Por-pois-es in-deed are to this day con-sid-ered fine eat-ing The meat is made in-to bal-ls about the size of bil-liard bal-ls and be-ing well sea-soned and spiced might be tak-en for tur-tle bal-ls or veal bal-ls The old monks of Dun-fermline were very fond of them They had a great por-poise grant from the crown The fact is that among his hun-ters at least the whale would by all hands be con-sid-ered a noble dish were there not so much of him but when you come to sit down be-fore a meat pie near-ly one hun-dred feet long it takes away your ap-petite On-ly the most un-prej-u-diced of men like Stubb nowa-days par-take of cooked whales but the Esquimaux are not so fas-tid-i-ous We all know how they live upon whales and have rare old vin-tages of prime old train oil Zo-gran-da one of their most fa-mous doc-tors rec-om-mends strips of blub-ber for in-fan-ts as be-ing ex-ceed-ing-ly juicy and nour-ish-ing And this re-minds me that cer-tain English-men who long ago were ac-ci-den-tal-ly left in Green-land by a whal-ing ves-selâ that th-ese men ac-tu-al-ly lived for sev-er-al months on the mouldy scraps of whales which had been left ashore after try-ing out the blub-ber Among the Dutch whale-men th-ese scraps are called â frit-ter-sâ which in-deed they great-ly re-sem-ble be-ing brown and crisp and smelling some-thing like old Am-s-ter-dam housewivesâ dough nuts or oly cooks when fresh They have such an eat-able look that the most self deny-ing stranger can hard-ly keep his hands off But what fur-ther de-pre-ci-ates the whale as a civ-i-lized dish is his ex-ceed-ing rich-ness He is the great prize ox of the sea too fat to be del-i-cate-ly good Look at his hump which would be as fine eat-ing as the buf-faloâ s which is es-teemed a rare dish were it not such a sol-id pyra-mid of fat But the sper-ma-ceti it-self how bland and creamy that is like the trans-par-ent half jel-lied white meat of a co-coanut in the third month of its growth yet far too rich to sup-ply a sub-sti-tute for but-ter Nev-er-the-less many whale-men have a method of ab-sorb-ing it in-to some other sub-stance and then par-tak-ing of it In the long try watch-es of the night it is a com-mon thing for the sea-men to dip their ship bis-cuit in-to the huge oil pots and let them fry there awhile Many a good sup-per have I thus made In the case of a small Sperm Whale the brains are ac-count-ed a fine dish The cas-ket of the skull is bro-ken in-to with an axe and the two plump whi-tish lobes be-ing with-drawn pre-cise-ly re-sem-bling two large pud-dings they are then mixed with flour and cooked in-to a most delectable mess in fla-vor some-what re-sem-bling calvesâ head which is quite a dish among some epi-cures and every one knows that some young bucks among the epi-cures by con-tin-u-al-ly din-ing upon calvesâ brains by and by get to have a lit-tle brains of their own so as to be able to tell a calfâ s head from their own heads which in-deed re-quires un-com-mon dis-crim-i-na-tion And that is the rea-son why a young buck with an in-tel-li-gent look-ing calfâ s head be-fore him is some-how one of the sad-dest sights you can see The head looks a sort of re-proach-ful-ly at him with an â Et tu Brute â ex-pres-sion It is not per-haps en-tire-ly be-cause the whale is so ex-ces-sive-ly unc-tu-ous that lands-men seem to re-gard the eat-ing of him with ab-hor-rence that ap-pears to re-sult in some way from the con-sid-er-a-tion be-fore men-tioned i e that a man should eat a new-ly mur-dered thing of the sea and eat it too by its own light But no doubt the first man that ever mur-dered an ox was re-gard-ed as a mur-derer per-haps he was hung and if he had been put on his tri-al by ox-en he cer-tain-ly would have been and he cer-tain-ly de-served it if any mur-derer does Go to the meat mar-ket of a Satur-day night and see the crowds of live bipeds star-ing up at the long rows of dead quadrupeds Does not that sight take a tooth out of the can-ni-balâ s jaw Can-ni-bals who is not a can-ni-bal I tell you it will be more tol-er-a-ble for the Fe-jee that salt-ed down a lean mis-sion-ary in his cel-lar against a com-ing famine it will be more tol-er-a-ble for that prov-i-dent Fe-jee I say in the day of judg-ment than for thee civ-i-lized and en-light-ened gour-mand who nailest geese to the ground and feast-est on their bloat-ed livers in thy patÃ de foie gras But Stubb he eats the whale by its own light does he and that is ad-ding in-sult to in-jury is it Look at your knife han-dle there my civ-i-lized and en-light-ened gour-mand din-ing off that roast beef what is that han-dle made of â what but the bones of the brother of the very ox you are eat-ing And what do you pick your teeth with after devour-ing that fat goose With a feather of the same fowl And with what quill did the Sec-re-tary of the So-ci-ety for the Sup-pres-sion of Cru-el-ty to Gan-ders for-mal-ly in-dite his cir-cu-lars It is on-ly within the last month or two that that so-ci-ety passed a res-o-lu-tion to pa-tron-ize noth-ing but steel pens CHAPTER 66 The Shark Mas-sacre When in the South-ern Fish-ery a cap-tured Sperm Whale after long and weary toil is brought along-side late at night it is not as a gen-er-al thing at least cus-tom-ary to pro-ceed at once to the busi-ness of cut-ting him in For that busi-ness is an ex-ceed-ing-ly la-bo-ri-ous one is not very soon com-plet-ed and re-quires all hands to set about it There-fore the com-mon usage is to take in all sail lash the helm aâ lee and then send every one below to his ham-mock till day-light with the reser-va-tion that un-til that time an-chor watch-es shall be kept that is two and two for an hour each cou-ple the crew in ro-ta-tion shall mount the deck to see that all goes well But some-times espe-cial-ly upon the Line in the Pa-cif-ic this plan will not an-swer at all be-cause such in-cal-cu-la-ble hosts of sharks gather round the moored car-case that were he left so for six hours say on a stretch lit-tle more than the skele-ton would be vis-i-ble by morn-ing In most other parts of the ocean how-ev-er where th-ese fish do not so large-ly abound their won-drous vo-rac-i-ty can be at times con-sid-er-ably di-min-ished by vig-or-ous-ly stir-ring them up with sharp whal-ing spades a pro-ce-dure notwith-stand-ing which in some in-stances on-ly seems to tick-le them in-to still greater ac-tiv-i-ty But it was not thus in the pre-sent case with the Pe-quodâ s sharks though to be sure any man unac-cus-tomed to such sights to have looked over her side that night would have al-most thought the whole round sea was one huge cheese and those sharks the mag-gots in it Nev-er-the-less upon Stubb set-ting the an-chor watch after his sup-per was con-clud-ed and when ac-cord-ing-ly Quee-queg and a fore-cas-tle sea-man came on deck no small ex-cite-ment was creat-ed among the sharks for im-me-di-ate-ly sus-pend-ing the cut-ting stages over the side and low-er-ing three lan-terns so that they cast long gleams of light over the tur-bid sea th-ese two mariners dart-ing their long whal-ing spades kept up an inces-sant mur-der-ing of the sharks by strik-ing the keen steel deep in-to their skul-ls seem-ing-ly their on-ly vi-tal part But in the foamy con-fu-sion of their mixed and strug-gling hosts the marks-men could not al-ways hit their mark and this brought about new reve-la-tions of the in-cred-i-ble fe-roc-i-ty of the foe They vi-cious-ly snapped not on-ly at each otherâ s disem-bow-el-men-ts but like flex-i-ble bows bent round and bit their own till those en-trails seemed swal-lowed over and over again by the same mouth to be op-po-site-ly void-ed by the gap-ing wound Nor was this all It was un-safe to med-dle with the corpses and ghosts of th-ese crea-tures A sort of gener-ic or Pan-the-is-tic vi-tal-i-ty seemed to lurk in their very join-ts and bones after what might be called the in-di-vid-u-al life had depart-ed Killed and hoist-ed on deck for the sake of his skin one of th-ese sharks al-most took poor Quee-quegâ s hand off when he tried to shut down the dead lid of his mur-der-ous jaw The whal-ing spade used for cut-ting in is made of the very best steel is about the big-ness of a manâ s spread hand and in gen-er-al shape cor-re-sponds to the gar-den im-ple-ment after which it is named on-ly its sides are per-fect-ly flat and its up-per end con-sid-er-ably nar-row-er than the low-er This weapon is al-ways kept as sharp as pos-si-ble and when be-ing used is oc-ca-sion-al-ly honed just like a ra-zor In its sock-et a stiff pole from twen-ty to thir-ty feet long is insert-ed for a han-dle â Quee-queg no care what god made him shark â said the sav-age ago-niz-ing-ly lift-ing his hand up and down â wed-der Fe-jee god or Nan-tuck-et god but de god wat made shark must be one dam In-gin â CHAPTER 67 Cut-ting In It was a Satur-day night and such a Sab-bath as fol-lowed Ex of-fi-cio pro-fes-sors of Sab-bath break-ing are all whale-men The ivory Pe-quod was turned in-to what seemed a sham-ble every sailor a butch-er You would have thought we were of-fer-ing up ten thou-sand red ox-en to the sea gods In the first place the enor-mous cut-ting tack-les among other pon-der-ous things com-pris-ing a clus-ter of blocks gen-er-al-ly paint-ed green and which no sin-gle man can pos-si-bly liftâ this vast bunch of grapes was swayed up to the main top and firm-ly lashed to the low-er mast head the strongest point any-where above a shipâ s deck The end of the hawser like rope wind-ing through th-ese in-tri-ca-cies was then con-duct-ed to the wind-lass and the huge low-er block of the tack-les was swung over the whale to this block the great blub-ber hook weigh-ing some one hun-dred pounds was at-tached And now sus-pend-ed in stages over the side Star-buck and Stubb the mates armed with their long spades be-gan cut-ting a hole in the body for the inser-tion of the hook just above the near-est of the two side fins This done a broad semi-cir-cu-lar line is cut round the hole the hook is insert-ed and the main body of the crew strik-ing up a wild cho-rus now com-mence heav-ing in one dense crowd at the wind-lass When in-stant-ly the en-tire ship ca-reens over on her side every bolt in her starts like the nail heads of an old house in frosty weather she trem-bles quiv-ers and nods her fright-ed mast heads to the sky More and more she leans over to the whale while every gasp-ing heave of the wind-lass is an-swered by a help-ing heave from the bil-lows till at last a swift startling snap is heard with a great swash the ship rol-ls up-wards and back-wards from the whale and the tri-umphant tack-le ris-es in-to sight drag-ging after it the disen-gaged semi-cir-cu-lar end of the first strip of blub-ber Now as the blub-ber en-velopes the whale pre-cise-ly as the rind does an orange so is it stripped off from the body pre-cise-ly as an orange is some-times stripped by spi-ral-iz-ing it For the strain con-stant-ly kept up by the wind-lass con-tin-u-al-ly keeps the whale rolling over and over in the water and as the blub-ber in one strip uni-form-ly peels off along the line called the â scarf â si-mul-ta-ne-ous-ly cut by the spades of Star-buck and Stubb the mates and just as fast as it is thus peeled off and in-deed by that very act it-self it is all the time be-ing hoist-ed higher and higher aloft till its up-per end grazes the main top the men at the wind-lass then cease heav-ing and for a mo-ment or two the prodi-gious blood drip-ping mass sways to and fro as if let down from the sky and every one pre-sent must take good heed to dodge it when it swings else it may box his ears and pitch him head-long over-board One of the at-tend-ing har-pooneers now ad-vances with a long keen weapon called a board-ing sword and watch-ing his chance he dex-ter-ous-ly slices out a con-sid-er-able hole in the low-er part of the sway-ing mass In-to this hole the end of the se-cond al-ter-nat-ing great tack-le is then hooked so as to re-tain a hold upon the blub-ber in order to pre-pare for what fol-lows Where-upon this ac-com-plished swords-man warn-ing all hands to stand off once more makes a sci-en-tif-ic dash at the mass and with a few side-long des-per-ate lung-ing slic-ings sev-ers it com-plete-ly in twain so that while the short low-er part is still fast the long up-per strip called a blan-ket piece swings clear and is all ready for low-er-ing The heavers for-ward now re-sume their song and while the one tack-le is peel-ing and hoist-ing a se-cond strip from the whale the other is slow-ly slack-ened away and down goes the first strip through the main hatch-way right be-neath in-to an un-fur-nished par-lor called the blub-ber room In-to this twi-light apart-ment sundry nim-ble hands keep coil-ing away the long blan-ket piece as if it were a great live mass of plait-ed ser-pen-ts And thus the work pro-ceeds the two tack-les hoist-ing and low-er-ing si-mul-ta-ne-ous-ly both whale and wind-lass heav-ing the heavers sing-ing the blub-ber room gentle-men coil-ing the mates scarf-ing the ship strain-ing and all hands swear-ing oc-ca-sion-al-ly by way of as-suag-ing the gen-er-al fric-tion CHAPTER 68 The Blan-ket I have giv-en no small at-ten-tion to that not un-vexed sub-ject the skin of the whale I have had con-tro-ver-sies about it with ex-pe-ri-enced whale-men afloat and learned nat-u-ral-ists ashore My orig-i-nal opin-ion re-mains un-changed but it is on-ly an opin-ion The ques-tion is what and where is the skin of the whale Al-ready you know what his blub-ber is That blub-ber is some-thing of the con-sis-tence of firm close grained beef but tougher more elas-tic and com-pact and ranges from eight or ten to twelve and fif-teen inch-es in thick-ness Now how-ev-er pre-pos-ter-ous it may at first seem to talk of any crea-tureâ s skin as be-ing of that sort of con-sis-tence and thick-ness yet in point of fact th-ese are no ar-gu-men-ts against such a pre-sump-tion be-cause you can-not raise any other dense en-velop-ing lay-er from the whaleâ s body but that same blub-ber and the outer-most en-velop-ing lay-er of any an-i-mal if rea-son-ably dense what can that be but the skin True from the un-marred dead body of the whale you may scrape off with your hand an in-finite-ly thin trans-par-ent sub-stance some-what re-sem-bling the thinnest shreds of is-in-glass on-ly it is al-most as flex-i-ble and soft as satin that is pre-vi-ous to be-ing dried when it not on-ly con-trac-ts and thick-ens but be-comes rather hard and brit-tle I have sev-er-al such dried bits which I use for marks in my whale books It is trans-par-ent as I said be-fore and be-ing laid upon the print-ed page I have some-times pleased my-self with fan-cy-ing it ex-ert-ed a mag-ni-fy-ing in-flu-ence At any rate it is pleas-ant to read about whales through their own spec-ta-cles as you may say But what I am driv-ing at here is this That same in-finite-ly thin is-in-glass sub-stance which I ad-mit in-vests the en-tire body of the whale is not so much to be re-gard-ed as the skin of the crea-ture as the skin of the skin so to speak for it were sim-ply ridicu-lous to say that the prop-er skin of the tre-men-dous whale is thin-ner and more ten-der than the skin of a new born child But no more of this As-sum-ing the blub-ber to be the skin of the whale then when this skin as in the case of a very large Sperm Whale will yield the bulk of one hun-dred bar-rels of oil and when it is con-sid-ered that in quan-ti-ty or rather weight that oil in its ex-pressed state is on-ly three fourths and not the en-tire sub-stance of the coat some idea may hence be had of the enor-mous-ness of that an-i-mat-ed mass a mere part of whose mere in-tegu-ment yields such a lake of liq-uid as that Reck-on-ing ten bar-rels to the ton you have ten tons for the net weight of on-ly three quar-ters of the stuff of the whaleâ s skin In life the vis-i-ble sur-face of the Sperm Whale is not the least among the many marvels he pre-sen-ts Al-most in-vari-ably it is all over oblique-ly crossed and re crossed with num-ber-less straight marks in thick ar-ray some-thing like those in the finest Ital-ian line en-grav-ings But th-ese marks do not seem to be im-pressed upon the is-in-glass sub-stance above men-tioned but seem to be seen through it as if they were en-graved upon the body it-self Nor is this all In some in-stances to the quick ob-ser-vant eye those lin-ear marks as in a ver-i-ta-ble en-grav-ing but af-ford the ground for far other de-lin-eations Th-ese are hiero-glyph-i-cal that is if you call those mys-te-ri-ous cyphers on the wal-ls of pyra-mids hiero-glyph-ics then that is the prop-er word to use in the pre-sent con-nex-ion By my re-ten-tive me-mory of the hiero-glyph-ics upon one Sperm Whale in par-tic-u-lar I was much struck with a plate rep-re-sent-ing the old In-di-an char-ac-ters chis-elled on the fa-mous hiero-glyph-ic pal-isades on the banks of the Up-per Mis-sis-sip-pi Like those mys-tic rocks too the mys-tic marked whale re-mains un-de-ci-pher-able This al-lu-sion to the In-di-an rocks re-minds me of another thing Be-sides all the other phenom-e-na which the ex-te-ri-or of the Sperm Whale pre-sen-ts he not sel-dom dis-plays the back and more espe-cial-ly his flanks ef-faced in great part of the reg-u-lar lin-ear ap-pear-ance by rea-son of numer-ous rude scratch-es al-to-geth-er of an ir-reg-u-lar ran-dom aspect I should say that those New Eng-land rocks on the sea coast which Agas-siz imag-ines to bear the marks of vi-o-lent scrap-ing con-tact with vast float-ing ice-bergsâ I should say that those rocks must not a lit-tle re-sem-ble the Sperm Whale in this par-tic-u-lar It al-so seems to me that such scratch-es in the whale are prob-a-bly made by hos-tile con-tact with other whales for I have most re-marked them in the large full grown bul-ls of the species A word or two more con-cern-ing this mat-ter of the skin or blub-ber of the whale It has al-ready been said that it is stript from him in long pieces called blan-ket pieces Like most sea ter-ms this one is very hap-py and sig-nif-i-cant For the whale is in-deed wrapt up in his blub-ber as in a real blan-ket or coun-ter-pane or still bet-ter an In-di-an poncho slipt over his head and skirt-ing his ex-trem-i-ty It is by rea-son of this cosy blan-ket-ing of his body that the whale is en-abled to keep him-self com-fort-able in all weathers in all seas times and tides What would be-come of a Green-land whale say in those shud-der-ing icy seas of the North if un-sup-plied with his cosy surtout True other fish are found ex-ceed-ing-ly brisk in those Hyper-bore-an waters but th-ese be it ob-served are your cold blood-ed lun-g-less fish whose very bel-lies are re-frig-er-a-tors crea-tures that warm them-selves un-der the lee of an ice-berg as a trav-eller in win-ter would bask be-fore an inn fire where-as like man the whale has lungs and warm blood Freeze his blood and he dies How won-der-ful is it thenâ ex-cept after ex-pla-na-tionâ that this great mon-ster to whom cor-po-re-al warmth is as indis-pens-able as it is to man how won-der-ful that he should be found at home im-mersed to his lips for life in those Arc-tic waters where when sea-men fall over-board they are some-times found months after-wards per-pen-dic-u-lar-ly frozen in-to the hearts of fields of ice as a fly is found glued in am-ber But more sur-pris-ing is it to know as has been proved by ex-per-i-ment that the blood of a Po-lar whale is warmer than that of a Bor-neo ne-gro in sum-mer It does seem to me that here-in we see the rare virtue of a strong in-di-vid-u-al vi-tal-i-ty and the rare virtue of thick wal-ls and the rare virtue of in-te-ri-or spa-cious-ness Oh man ad-mire and model thy-self after the whale Do thou too re-main warm among ice Do thou too live in this world without be-ing of it Be cool at the equa-tor keep thy blood flu-id at the Pole Like the great dome of St Peterâ s and like the great whale re-tain O man in all sea-sons a tem-per-a-ture of thine own But how easy and how hope-less to teach th-ese fine things Of erec-tions how few are domed like St Peterâ s of crea-tures how few vast as the whale CHAPTER 69 The Funer-al â Haul in the chains Let the car-case go astern â The vast tack-les have now done their du-ty The peeled white body of the be-head-ed whale flash-es like a mar-ble sepul-chre though changed in hue it has not per-cep-ti-bly lost any-thing in bulk It is still colos-sal Slow-ly it floats more and more away the water round it torn and splashed by the in-sa-tiate sharks and the air above vexed with ra-pa-cious flights of scream-ing fowls whose beaks are like so many in-sult-ing po-niards in the whale The vast white head-less phan-tom floats fur-ther and fur-ther from the ship and every rod that it so floats what seem square roods of sharks and cu-bic roods of fowls aug-ment the mur-der-ous din For hours and hours from the al-most sta-tion-ary ship that hideous sight is seen Be-neath the un-cloud-ed and mild azure sky upon the fair face of the pleas-ant sea waft-ed by the joy-ous breezes that great mass of death floats on and on till lost in in-fi-nite per-spec-tives Thereâ s a most dole-ful and most mock-ing funer-al The sea vul-tures all in pious mourn-ing the air sharks all punc-til-ious-ly in black or speck-led In life but few of them would have helped the whale I ween if per-ad-ven-ture he had need-ed it but upon the ban-quet of his funer-al they most pious-ly do pounce Oh hor-ri-ble vul-tureism of earth from which not the might-i-est whale is free Nor is this the end Des-e-crat-ed as the body is a venge-ful ghost sur-vives and hovers over it to scare Espied by some timid man of war or blun-der-ing dis-cov-ery ves-sel from afar when the dis-tance ob-scur-ing the swarm-ing fowls nev-er-the-less still shows the white mass float-ing in the sun and the white spray heav-ing high against it straight-way the whaleâ s un-harm-ing corpse with trem-bling fingers is set down in the logâ shoals rocks and break-ers here-abouts be-ware And for years after-wards per-haps ships shun the place leap-ing over it as sil-ly sheep leap over a vacu-um be-cause their lead-er orig-i-nal-ly leaped there when a stick was held Thereâ s your law of prece-den-ts thereâ s your util-i-ty of tra-di-tions thereâ s the sto-ry of your ob-sti-nate sur-vival of old beliefs nev-er bot-tomed on the earth and now not even hover-ing in the air Thereâ s ortho-doxy Thus while in life the great whaleâ s body may have been a real ter-ror to his foes in his death his ghost be-comes a pow-er-less pan-ic to a world Are you a believ-er in ghosts my friend There are other ghosts than the Cock Lane one and far deep-er men than Doc-tor John-son who believe in them CHAPTER 7 The Sph-ynx It should not have been omit-ted that pre-vi-ous to com-plete-ly strip-ping the body of the le-viathan he was be-head-ed Now the be-head-ing of the Sperm Whale is a sci-en-tif-ic anatom-i-cal feat upon which ex-pe-ri-enced whale sur-geons very much pride them-selves and not without rea-son Con-sid-er that the whale has noth-ing that can prop-er-ly be called a neck on the con-trary where his head and body seem to join there in that very place is the thick-est part of him Re-mem-ber al-so that the sur-geon must oper-ate from above some eight or ten feet in-ter-ven-ing between him and his sub-ject and that sub-ject al-most hid-den in a dis-coloured rolling and of-ten-times tu-mul-tuous and burst-ing sea Bear in mind too that un-der th-ese un-to-ward cir-cum-stances he has to cut many feet deep in the flesh and in that subter-ra-ne-ous man-ner without so much as get-ting one sin-gle peep in-to the ever con-tract-ing gash thus made he must sk-il-ful-ly steer clear of all ad-ja-cent in-ter-dict-ed parts and ex-act-ly di-vide the spine at a crit-i-cal point hard by its inser-tion in-to the skull Do you not marvel then at Stub-bâ s boast that he de-mand-ed but ten min-utes to be-head a sperm whale When first sev-ered the head is dropped astern and held there by a cable till the body is stripped That done if it be-long to a small whale it is hoist-ed on deck to be de-lib-er-ate-ly dis-posed of But with a full grown le-viathan this is im-pos-si-ble for the sperm whaleâ s head em-braces near-ly one third of his en-tire bulk and com-plete-ly to sus-pend such a bur-den as that even by the im-mense tack-les of a whaler this were as vain a thing as to at-tempt weigh-ing a Dutch barn in jeweller-sâ scales The Pe-quodâ s whale be-ing de-cap-i-tat-ed and the body stripped the head was hoist-ed against the shipâ s sideâ about half way out of the sea so that it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its na-tive ele-ment And there with the strained craft steeply lean-ing over to it by rea-son of the enor-mous down-ward drag from the low-er mast head and every yard arm on that side pro-ject-ing like a crane over the waves there that blood drip-ping head hung to the Pe-quodâ s waist like the giant Holofer-nesâ s from the gir-dle of Ju-dith When this last task was ac-com-plished it was noon and the sea-men went below to their din-ner Si-lence reigned over the be-fore tu-mul-tuous but now de-sert-ed deck An in-tense cop-per calm like a univer-sal yel-low lo-tus was more and more un-fold-ing its noise-less mea-sure-less leaves upon the sea A short space elapsed and up in-to this noise-less-ness came Ahab alone from his cabin Tak-ing a few turns on the quar-ter deck he paused to gaze over the side then slow-ly get-ting in-to the main chains he took Stub-bâ s long spadeâ still re-main-ing there after the whaleâ s de-cap-i-ta-tionâ and strik-ing it in-to the low-er part of the half sus-pend-ed mass placed its other end crutch wise un-der one arm and so stood lean-ing over with eyes at-ten-tive-ly fixed on this head It was a black and hood-ed head and hang-ing there in the midst of so in-tense a calm it seemed the Sph-ynxâ s in the desert â Speak thou vast and ven-er-a-ble head â mut-tered Ahab â which though un-gar-nished with a beard yet here and there look-est hoary with moss-es speak mighty head and tell us the se-cret thing that is in thee Of all divers thou hast dived the deep-est That head upon which the up-per sun now gleams has moved amid this worldâ s foun-da-tions Where un-record-ed names and navies rust and un-told hopes and an-chors rot where in her mur-der-ous hold this fri-gate earth is bal-last-ed with bones of mil-lions of the drowned there in that aw-ful water land there was thy most fa-mil-iar home Thou hast been where bell or div-er nev-er went hast slept by many a sailorâ s side where sleep-less mothers would give their lives to lay them down Thou sawâ st the locked lovers when leap-ing from their flam-ing ship heart to heart they sank be-neath the ex-ult-ing wave true to each other when heav-en seemed false to them Thou sawâ st the mur-dered mate when tossed by pi-rates from the mid-night deck for hours he fell in-to the deep-er mid-night of the in-sa-tiate maw and his mur-der-ers still sailed on un-harmedâ while swift light-nings shivered the neigh-bor-ing ship that would have borne a righ-teous hus-band to out-stretched long-ing ar-ms O head thou hast seen enough to split the plan-ets and make an in-fi-del of Abra-ham and not one syl-la-ble is thine â â Sail ho â cried a tri-umphant voice from the main mast head â Aye Well now thatâ s cheer-ing â cried Ahab sud-den-ly erect-ing him-self while whole thun-der clouds swept aside from his brow â That live-ly cry upon this dead-ly calm might al-most con-vert a bet-ter man â Where away â â Three poin-ts on the star-board bow sir and bring-ing down her breeze to us â Bet-ter and bet-ter man Would now St Paul would come along that way and to my breeze-less-ness bring his breeze O Na-ture and O soul of man how far beyond all ut-ter-ance are your linked analo-gies not the smallest atom stirs or lives on mat-ter but has its cun-ning du-pli-cate in mind â CHAPTER 71 The Jer-oboamâ s Sto-ry Hand in hand ship and breeze blew on but the breeze came faster than the ship and soon the Pe-quod be-gan to rock By and by through the glass the strangerâ s boats and manned mast heads proved her a whale ship But as she was so far to wind-ward and shoot-ing by ap-par-ent-ly mak-ing a pas-sage to some other ground the Pe-quod could not hope to reach her So the sig-nal was set to see what re-sponse would be made Here be it said that like the ves-sels of mil-i-tary marines the ships of the Amer-i-can Whale Fleet have each a pri-vate sig-nal all which sig-nals be-ing col-lect-ed in a book with the names of the re-spec-tive ves-sels at-tached every cap-tain is pro-vid-ed with it There-by the whale com-man-ders are en-abled to recog-nise each other upon the ocean even at con-sid-er-able dis-tances and with no small fa-cil-i-ty The Pe-quodâ s sig-nal was at last re-spond-ed to by the strangerâ s set-ting her own which proved the ship to be the Jer-oboam of Nan-tuck-et Squar-ing her yards she bore down ranged abeam un-der the Pe-quodâ s lee and low-ered a boat it soon drew nigh but as the side lad-der was be-ing rigged by Star-buckâ s order to ac-com-mo-date the visit-ing cap-tain the stranger in ques-tion waved his hand from his boatâ s stern in to-ken of that pro-ceed-ing be-ing en-tire-ly un-nec-es-sary It turned out that the Jer-oboam had a malig-nant epi-dem-ic on board and that May-hew her cap-tain was fear-ful of in-fect-ing the Pe-quodâ s com-pa-ny For though him-self and boatâ s crew re-mained un-taint-ed and though his ship was half a ri-fle shot off and an in-cor-rupt-ible sea and air rolling and flow-ing between yet con-sci-en-tious-ly ad-her-ing to the timid quar-an-tine of the land he peremp-to-ri-ly re-fused to come in-to direct con-tact with the Pe-quod But this did by no means prevent all com-mu-ni-ca-tions Pre-serv-ing an in-ter-val of some few yards between it-self and the ship the Jer-oboamâ s boat by the oc-ca-sion-al use of its oars con-trived to keep par-al-lel to the Pe-quod as she heav-i-ly forged through the sea for by this time it blew very fresh with her main top-sail aback though in-deed at times by the sud-den onset of a large rolling wave the boat would be pushed some way ahead but would be soon sk-il-ful-ly brought to her prop-er bear-ings again Sub-ject to this and other the like in-ter-rup-tions now and then a con-ver-sa-tion was sus-tained between the two par-ties but at in-ter-vals not without still another in-ter-rup-tion of a very dif-fer-ent sort Pulling an oar in the Jer-oboamâ s boat was a man of a sin-gu-lar ap-pear-ance even in that wild whal-ing life where in-di-vid-u-al nota-bil-i-ties make up all to-tal-i-ties He was a small short youngish man sprin-kled all over his face with freck-les and wear-ing re-dun-dant yel-low hair A long skirt-ed ca-bal-is-ti-cal-ly cut coat of a fad-ed wal-nut tinge en-veloped him the over-lap-ping sleeves of which were rolled up on his wrists A deep set-tled fa-nat-ic delir-i-um was in his eyes So soon as this fig-ure had been first de-scried Stubb had ex-claimedâ â Thatâ s he thatâ s he â the long togged scaramouch the Town Hoâ s com-pa-ny told us of â Stubb here al-lud-ed to a strange sto-ry told of the Jer-oboam and a cer-tain man among her crew some time pre-vi-ous when the Pe-quod spoke the Town Ho Ac-cord-ing to this ac-count and what was sub-se-quent-ly learned it seemed that the scaramouch in ques-tion had gained a won-der-ful as-cen-den-cy over al-most every-body in the Jer-oboam His sto-ry was this He had been orig-i-nal-ly nur-tured among the crazy so-ci-ety of Neskye-u-na Shak-ers where he had been a great prophet in their cracked se-cret meet-ings hav-ing sev-er-al times descend-ed from heav-en by the way of a trap door an-nounc-ing the speedy open-ing of the seventh vial which he car-ried in his vest pock-et but which in-stead of con-tain-ing gun-pow-der was sup-posed to be charged with lau-danum A strange apos-tolic whim hav-ing seized him he had left Neskye-u-na for Nan-tuck-et where with that cun-ning pe-cu-liar to crazi-ness he as-sumed a steady com-mon sense ex-te-ri-or and of-fered him-self as a green hand can-di-date for the Jer-oboamâ s whal-ing voy-age They en-gaged him but straight-way upon the shipâ s get-ting out of sight of land his in-san-i-ty broke out in a freshet He an-nounced him-self as the ar-changel Gabriel and com-mand-ed the cap-tain to jump over-board He pub-lished his man-i-festo where-by he set him-self forth as the de-liv-erer of the isles of the sea and vicar gen-er-al of all Ocean-i-ca The un-flinch-ing earnest-ness with which he de-clared th-ese things â the dark dar-ing play of his sleep-less ex-cit-ed imag-i-na-tion and all the preter-nat-u-ral ter-rors of real delir-i-um unit-ed to in-vest this Gabriel in the minds of the ma-jor-i-ty of the ig-no-rant crew with an at-mo-sphere of sa-cred-ness More-over they were afraid of him As such a man how-ev-er was not of much prac-ti-cal use in the ship espe-cial-ly as he re-fused to work ex-cept when he pleased the in-cred-u-lous cap-tain would fain have been rid of him but ap-prised that that in-di-vid-u-alâ s in-ten-tion was to land him in the first con-ve-nient port the ar-changel forth-with opened all his seals and vial-sâ devot-ing the ship and all hands to un-con-di-tion-al perdi-tion in case this in-ten-tion was car-ried out So strong-ly did he work upon his dis-ci-ples among the crew that at last in a body they went to the cap-tain and told him if Gabriel was sent from the ship not a man of them would re-main He was there-fore forced to relin-quish his plan Nor would they per-mit Gabriel to be any way mal-treat-ed say or do what he would so that it came to pass that Gabriel had the com-plete free-dom of the ship The con-se-quence of all this was that the ar-changel cared lit-tle or noth-ing for the cap-tain and mates and since the epi-dem-ic had bro-ken out he car-ried a higher hand than ever declar-ing that the plague as he called it was at his sole com-mand nor should it be stayed but ac-cord-ing to his good plea-sure The sailors most-ly poor devils cringed and some of them fawned be-fore him in obe-di-ence to his in-struc-tions some-times ren-der-ing him per-son-al ho-mage as to a god Such things may seem in-cred-i-ble but how-ev-er won-drous they are true Nor is the his-to-ry of fa-nat-ics half so strik-ing in re-spect to the mea-sure-less self de-cep-tion of the fa-nat-ic him-self as his mea-sure-less pow-er of de-ceiv-ing and bedev-illing so many others But it is time to re-turn to the Pe-quod â I fear not thy epi-dem-ic man â said Ahab from the bul-warks to Cap-tain May-hew who stood in the boatâ s stern â come on board â But now Gabriel start-ed to his feet â Think think of the fev-ers yel-low and bil-ious Be-ware of the hor-ri-ble plague â â Gabriel Gabriel â cried Cap-tain May-hew â thou must eitherâ â But that in-stant a head-long wave shot the boat far ahead and its seethings drowned all speech â Hast thou seen the White Whale â de-mand-ed Ahab when the boat drift-ed back â Think think of thy whale boat stoven and sunk Be-ware of the hor-ri-ble tail â â I tell thee again Gabriel thatâ â But again the boat tore ahead as if dragged by fiends Noth-ing was said for some mo-men-ts while a suc-ces-sion of riotous waves rolled by which by one of those oc-ca-sion-al caprices of the seas were tum-bling not heav-ing it Mean-time the hoist-ed sperm whaleâ s head jogged about very vi-o-lent-ly and Gabriel was seen eye-ing it with rather more ap-pre-hen-sive-ness than his ar-changel na-ture seemed to war-rant When this in-ter-lude was over Cap-tain May-hew be-gan a dark sto-ry con-cern-ing Mo-by Dick not how-ev-er without fre-quent in-ter-rup-tions from Gabriel when-ev-er his name was men-tioned and the crazy sea that seemed leagued with him It seemed that the Jer-oboam had not long left home when upon speak-ing a whale ship her peo-ple were reli-ably ap-prised of the ex-is-tence of Mo-by Dick and the hav-oc he had made Greed-i-ly suck-ing in this in-tel-li-gence Gabriel solemn-ly warned the cap-tain against at-tack-ing the White Whale in case the mon-ster should be seen in his gib-ber-ing in-san-i-ty pro-nounc-ing the White Whale to be no less a be-ing than the Shak-er God in-car-nat-ed the Shak-ers re-ceiv-ing the Bi-ble But when some year or two after-wards Mo-by Dick was fair-ly sight-ed from the mast heads Macey the chief mate burned with ar-dour to en-counter him and the cap-tain him-self be-ing not un-will-ing to let him have the op-por-tu-ni-ty de-spite all the ar-changelâ s de-nun-ci-a-tions and fore-warn-ings Macey suc-ceed-ed in per-suad-ing five men to man his boat With them he pushed off and after much weary pulling and many per-ilous un-suc-cess-ful onsets he at last suc-ceed-ed in get-ting one iron fast Mean-time Gabriel as-cend-ing to the main roy-al mast head was toss-ing one arm in fran-tic ges-tures and hurl-ing forth prophe-cies of speedy doom to the sacri-le-gious as-sailan-ts of his divin-i-ty Now while Macey the mate was stand-ing up in his boatâ s bow and with all the reck-less en-er-gy of his tribe was vent-ing his wild ex-cla-ma-tions upon the whale and es-say-ing to get a fair chance for his poised lance lo a broad white shad-ow rose from the sea by its quick fan-ning mo-tion tem-porar-i-ly tak-ing the breath out of the bodies of the oars-men Next in-stant the luck-less mate so full of fu-ri-ous life was smit-ten bodi-ly in-to the air and mak-ing a long arc in his des-cent fell in-to the sea at the dis-tance of about fifty yards Not a chip of the boat was harmed nor a hair of any oars-manâ s head but the mate for ever sank It is well to paren-the-size here that of the fatal ac-ci-den-ts in the Sperm Whale Fish-ery this kind is per-haps al-most as fre-quent as any Some-times noth-ing is in-jured but the man who is thus an-ni-hi-lat-ed often-er the boatâ s bow is knocked off or the thigh board in which the heads-man stands is torn from its place and ac-com-pa-nies the body But strangest of all is the cir-cum-stance that in more in-stances than one when the body has been re-cov-ered not a sin-gle mark of vi-o-lence is dis-cernible the man be-ing stark dead The whole calami-ty with the falling form of Macey was plain-ly de-scried from the ship Rais-ing a pierc-ing shriekâ â The vial the vial â Gabriel called off the ter-ror strick-en crew from the fur-ther hunt-ing of the whale This ter-ri-ble event clothed the ar-changel with added in-flu-ence be-cause his cred-u-lous dis-ci-ples believed that he had specif-i-cal-ly fore an-nounced it in-stead of on-ly mak-ing a gen-er-al prophe-cy which any one might have done and so have chanced to hit one of many marks in the wide mar-gin al-lowed He be-came a name-less ter-ror to the ship May-hew hav-ing con-clud-ed his nar-ra-tion Ahab put such ques-tions to him that the stranger cap-tain could not for-bear in-quir-ing whether he in-tend-ed to hunt the White Whale if op-por-tu-ni-ty should of-fer To which Ahab an-sweredâ â Aye â Straight-way then Gabriel once more start-ed to his feet glar-ing upon the old man and ve-he-ment-ly ex-claimed with down-ward point-ed fingerâ â Think think of the blas-phe-merâ dead and down there â be-ware of the blas-phe-merâ s end â Ahab stolid-ly turned aside then said to May-hew â Cap-tain I have just bethought me of my let-ter bag there is a let-ter for one of thy of-fi-cers if I mis-take not Star-buck look over the bag â Every whale ship takes out a good-ly num-ber of let-ters for var-i-ous ships whose de-liv-ery to the per-sons to whom they may be ad-dressed depends upon the mere chance of en-coun-ter-ing them in the four oceans Thus most let-ters nev-er reach their mark and many are on-ly re-ceived after at-tain-ing an age of two or three years or more Soon Star-buck re-turned with a let-ter in his hand It was sore-ly tum-bled damp and covered with a dull spot-ted green mould in con-se-quence of be-ing kept in a dark lock-er of the cabin Of such a let-ter Death him-self might well have been the post boy â Canâ st not read it â cried Ahab â Give it me man Aye aye itâ s but a dim scrawl â whatâ s this â As he was study-ing it out Star-buck took a long cut-ting spade pole and with his knife slight-ly split the end to insert the let-ter there and in that way hand it to the boat without its com-ing any clos-er to the ship Mean-time Ahab hold-ing the let-ter mut-tered â Mr Harâ yes Mr Har-ryâ a wo-manâ s pin-ny hand â the manâ s wife Iâ ll wager â Ayeâ Mr Har-ry Macey Ship Jer-oboam â why itâ s Macey and heâ s dead â â Poor fel-low poor fel-low and from his wife â sighed May-hew â but let me have it â â Nay keep it thy-self â cried Gabriel to Ahab â thou art soon go-ing that way â â Curs-es throt-tle thee â yelled Ahab â Cap-tain May-hew stand by now to re-ceive itâ and tak-ing the fatal mis-sive from Star-buckâ s hands he caught it in the slit of the pole and reached it over towards the boat But as he did so the oars-men ex-pec-tant-ly de-sist-ed from row-ing the boat drift-ed a lit-tle towards the shipâ s stern so that as if by mag-ic the let-ter sud-den-ly ranged along with Gabrielâ s eager hand He clutched it in an in-stant seized the boat knife and im-pal-ing the let-ter on it sent it thus load-ed back in-to the ship It fell at Ahabâ s feet Then Gabriel shrieked out to his com-rades to give way with their oars and in that man-ner the muti-nous boat rapid-ly shot away from the Pe-quod As after this in-ter-lude the sea-men re-sumed their work upon the jack-et of the whale many strange things were hint-ed in ref-er-ence to this wild af-fair CHAPTER 72 The Mon-key Rope In the tu-mul-tuous busi-ness of cut-ting in and at-tend-ing to a whale there is much run-ning back-wards and for-wards among the crew Now hands are want-ed here and then again hands are want-ed there There is no stay-ing in any one place for at one and the same time every-thing has to be done every-where It is much the same with him who en-deav-ors the de-scrip-tion of the scene We must now re-trace our way a lit-tle It was men-tioned that upon first break-ing ground in the whaleâ s back the blub-ber hook was insert-ed in-to the orig-i-nal hole there cut by the spades of the mates But how did so clum-sy and weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that hole It was insert-ed there by my par-tic-u-lar friend Quee-queg whose du-ty it was as har-pooneer to descend upon the mon-sterâ s back for the spe-cial pur-pose re-ferred to But in very many cas-es cir-cum-stances re-quire that the har-pooneer shall re-main on the whale till the whole flens-ing or strip-ping oper-a-tion is con-clud-ed The whale be it ob-served lies al-most en-tire-ly sub-merged ex-cept-ing the im-me-di-ate parts oper-at-ed upon So down there some ten feet below the lev-el of the deck the poor har-pooneer floun-ders about half on the whale and half in the water as the vast mass re-volves like a tread mill be-neath him On the oc-ca-sion in ques-tion Quee-queg fig-ured in the High-land cos-tumeâ a shirt and sock-sâ in which to my eyes at least he ap-peared to un-com-mon ad-van-tage and no one had a bet-ter chance to ob-serve him as will present-ly be seen Be-ing the sav-ageâ s bows-man that is the per-son who pulled the bow oar in his boat the se-cond one from for-ward it was my cheer-ful du-ty to at-tend upon him while tak-ing that hard scrab-ble scram-ble upon the dead whaleâ s back You have seen Ital-ian or-gan boys hold-ing a danc-ing ape by a long cord Just so from the shipâ s steep side did I hold Quee-queg down there in the sea by what is tech-ni-cal-ly called in the fish-ery a mon-key rope at-tached to a strong strip of can-vas belt-ed round his waist It was a hu-mor-ous-ly per-ilous busi-ness for both of us For be-fore we pro-ceed fur-ther it must be said that the mon-key rope was fast at both ends fast to Quee-quegâ s broad can-vas belt and fast to my nar-row leather one So that for bet-ter or for worse we two for the time were wed-ded and should poor Quee-queg sink to rise no more then both usage and honor de-mand-ed that in-stead of cut-ting the cord it should drag me down in his wake So then an elon-gat-ed Si-amese li-ga-ture unit-ed us Quee-queg was my own insep-a-ra-ble twin brother nor could I any way get rid of the danger-ous li-a-bil-i-ties which the hem-pen bond en-tailed So strong-ly and me-ta-phys-i-cal-ly did I con-ceive of my si-t-u-a-tion then that while earnest-ly watch-ing his mo-tions I seemed distinct-ly to per-ceive that my own in-di-vid-u-al-i-ty was now merged in a joint stock com-pa-ny of two that my free will had re-ceived a mor-tal wound and that anotherâ s mis-take or mis-for-tune might plunge in-no-cent me in-to un-mer-it-ed disas-ter and death There-fore I saw that here was a sort of in-ter-reg-num in Prov-i-dence for its even hand-ed equity nev-er could have so gross an in-jus-tice And yet still fur-ther pon-der-ingâ while I jerked him now and then from between the whale and ship which would threat-en to jam himâ still fur-ther pon-der-ing I say I saw that this si-t-u-a-tion of mine was the pre-cise si-t-u-a-tion of every mor-tal that breathes on-ly in most cas-es he one way or other has this Si-amese con-nex-ion with a plu-ral-i-ty of other mor-tals If your banker breaks you snap if your apothe-cary by mis-take sends you poi-son in your pil-ls you die True you may say that by ex-ceed-ing cau-tion you may pos-si-bly es-cape th-ese and the mul-ti-tudi-nous other evil chances of life But han-dle Quee-quegâ s mon-key rope heed-ful-ly as I would some-times he jerked it so that I came very near slid-ing over-board Nor could I pos-si-bly for-get that do what I would I on-ly had the man-age-ment of one end of it The mon-key rope is found in all whalers but it was on-ly in the Pe-quod that the mon-key and his hold-er were ever tied to-geth-er This im-prove-ment upon the orig-i-nal usage was in-tro-duced by no less a man than Stubb in order to af-ford the im-per-illed har-pooneer the strongest pos-si-ble guar-an-tee for the faith-ful-ness and vig-i-lance of his mon-key rope hold-er I have hint-ed that I would often jerk poor Quee-queg from between the whale and the shipâ where he would oc-ca-sion-al-ly fall from the inces-sant rolling and sway-ing of both But this was not the on-ly jam-ming jeop-ardy he was ex-posed to Unap-palled by the mas-sacre made upon them dur-ing the night the sharks now fresh-ly and more keen-ly al-lured by the be-fore pent blood which be-gan to flow from the car-cassâ the rabid crea-tures swarmed round it like bees in a bee-hive And right in among those sharks was Quee-queg who often pushed them aside with his floun-der-ing feet A thing al-to-geth-er in-cred-i-ble were it not that at-tract-ed by such prey as a dead whale the other-wise mis-cel-la-neous-ly car-niv-o-rous shark will sel-dom touch a man Nev-er-the-less it may well be believed that since they have such a ravenous finger in the pie it is deemed but wise to look sharp to them Ac-cord-ing-ly be-sides the mon-key rope with which I now and then jerked the poor fel-low from too close a vicin-i-ty to the maw of what seemed a pe-cu-liar-ly fe-ro-cious sharkâ he was pro-vid-ed with still another pro-tec-tion Sus-pend-ed over the side in one of the stages Tashtego and Dag-goo con-tin-u-al-ly flour-ished over his head a cou-ple of keen whale spades where-with they slaugh-tered as many sharks as they could reach This pro-ce-dure of theirs to be sure was very dis-in-ter-est-ed and benev-o-lent of them They meant Quee-quegâ s best hap-pi-ness I ad-mit but in their hasty zeal to be-friend him and from the cir-cum-stance that both he and the sharks were at times half hid-den by the blood mud-dled water those indis-creet spades of theirs would come nearer am-pu-tat-ing a leg than a tail But poor Quee-queg I sup-pose strain-ing and gasp-ing there with that great iron hookâ poor Quee-queg I sup-pose on-ly prayed to his Yo-jo and gave up his life in-to the hands of his gods Well well my dear com-rade and twin brother thought I as I drew in and then slacked off the rope to every swell of the seaâ what mat-ters it after all Are you not the pre-cious image of each and all of us men in this whal-ing world That un-sound-ed ocean you gasp in is Life those sharks your foes those spades your friends and what between sharks and spades you are in a sad pick-le and per-il poor lad But courage there is good cheer in store for you Quee-queg For now as with blue lips and blood shot eyes the ex-haust-ed sav-age at last clim-bs up the chains and stands all drip-ping and in-vol-un-tar-i-ly trem-bling over the side the ste-ward ad-vances and with a benev-o-lent con-so-la-to-ry glance hands himâ what Some hot Cognac No hands him ye gods hands him a cup of tepid ginger and water â Ginger Do I smell ginger â sus-pi-cious-ly asked Stubb com-ing near â Yes this must be ginger â peer-ing in-to the as yet un-tast-ed cup Then stand-ing as if in-cred-u-lous for a while he calm-ly walked towards the as-ton-ished ste-ward slow-ly say-ing â Ginger ginger and will you have the good-ness to tell me Mr Dough Boy where lies the virtue of ginger Ginger is ginger the sort of fuel you use Dough boy to kin-dle a fire in this shiver-ing can-ni-bal Ginger â what the devil is ginger Sea coal fire-wood â lu-cifer match-es â tin-der â gun-pow-der â what the devil is ginger I say that you of-fer this cup to our poor Quee-queg here â â There is some sneak-ing Tem-per-ance So-ci-ety move-ment about this busi-ness â he sud-den-ly added now ap-proach-ing Star-buck who had just come from for-ward â Will you look at that kan-nakin sir smell of it if you please â Then watch-ing the mateâ s coun-te-nance he added â The ste-ward Mr Star-buck had the face to of-fer that calomel and jalap to Quee-queg there this in-stant off the whale Is the ste-ward an apothe-cary sir and may I ask whether this is the sort of bit-ters by which he blows back the life in-to a half drowned man â â I trust not â said Star-buck â it is poor stuff enough â â Aye aye ste-ward â cried Stubb â weâ ll teach you to drug a har-pooneer none of your apothe-caryâ s medicine here you want to poi-son us do ye You have got out in-surances on our lives and want to mur-der us all and pock-et the pro-ceeds do ye â â It was not me â cried Dough Boy â it was Aunt Char-i-ty that brought the ginger on board and bade me nev-er give the har-pooneers any spir-its but on-ly this ginger jubâ so she called it â â Ginger jub you ginger-ly ras-cal take that and run along with ye to the lock-ers and get some-thing bet-ter I hope I do no wrong Mr Star-buck It is the cap-tainâ s order-sâ grog for the har-pooneer on a whale â â Enough â replied Star-buck â on-ly donâ t hit him again butâ â â Oh I nev-er hurt when I hit ex-cept when I hit a whale or some-thing of that sort and this fel-lowâ s a weazel What were you about say-ing sir â â On-ly this go down with him and get what thou wan-test thy-self â When Stubb reap-peared he came with a dark flask in one hand and a sort of tea cad-dy in the other The first con-tained strong spir-its and was hand-ed to Quee-queg the se-cond was Aunt Char-i-tyâ s gift and that was freely giv-en to the waves CHAPTER 73 Stubb and Flask kill a Right Whale and Then Have a Talk over Him It must be borne in mind that all this time we have a Sperm Whaleâ s prodi-gious head hang-ing to the Pe-quodâ s side But we must let it con-tin-ue hang-ing there a while till we can get a chance to at-tend to it For the pre-sent other mat-ters press and the best we can do now for the head is to pray heav-en the tack-les may hold Now dur-ing the past night and forenoon the Pe-quod had grad-u-al-ly drift-ed in-to a sea which by its oc-ca-sion-al patch-es of yel-low brit gave unusu-al to-kens of the vicin-i-ty of Right Whales a species of the Le-viathan that but few sup-posed to be at this par-tic-u-lar time lurk-ing any-where near And though all hands com-mon-ly dis-dained the cap-ture of those in-fe-ri-or crea-tures and though the Pe-quod was not com-mis-sioned to cruise for them at all and though she had passed num-bers of them near the Crozetts without low-er-ing a boat yet now that a Sperm Whale had been brought along-side and be-head-ed to the sur-prise of all the an-nounce-ment was made that a Right Whale should be cap-tured that day if op-por-tu-ni-ty of-fered Nor was this long want-ing Tall spouts were seen to lee-ward and two boats Stub-bâ s and Flaskâ s were de-tached in pur-suit Pulling fur-ther and fur-ther away they at last be-came al-most in-vis-i-ble to the men at the mast head But sud-den-ly in the dis-tance they saw a great heap of tu-mul-tuous white water and soon after news came from aloft that one or both the boats must be fast An in-ter-val passed and the boats were in plain sight in the act of be-ing dragged right towards the ship by the tow-ing whale So close did the mon-ster come to the hull that at first it seemed as if he meant it mal-ice but sud-den-ly go-ing down in a mael-strom within three rods of the planks he whol-ly dis-ap-peared from view as if div-ing un-der the keel â Cut cut â was the cry from the ship to the boats which for one in-stant seemed on the point of be-ing brought with a dead-ly dash against the ves-selâ s side But hav-ing plen-ty of line yet in the tubs and the whale not sound-ing very rapid-ly they paid out abun-dance of rope and at the same time pulled with all their might so as to get ahead of the ship For a few min-utes the strug-gle was in-tense-ly crit-i-cal for while they still slacked out the tight-ened line in one direc-tion and still plied their oars in another the con-tend-ing strain threat-ened to take them un-der But it was on-ly a few feet ad-vance they sought to gain And they stuck to it till they did gain it when in-stant-ly a swift tre-mor was felt run-ning like light-ning along the keel as the strained line scrap-ing be-neath the ship sud-den-ly rose to view un-der her bows snap-ping and quiv-er-ing and so fling-ing off its drip-pings that the drops fell like bits of bro-ken glass on the water while the whale beyond al-so rose to sight and once more the boats were free to fly But the fagged whale abat-ed his speed and blind-ly al-ter-ing his course went round the stern of the ship tow-ing the two boats after him so that they per-formed a com-plete cir-cuit Mean-time they hauled more and more upon their lines till close flank-ing him on both sides Stubb an-swered Flask with lance for lance and thus round and round the Pe-quod the bat-tle went while the mul-ti-tudes of sharks that had be-fore swum round the Sperm Whaleâ s body rushed to the fresh blood that was spilled thirsti-ly drink-ing at every new gash as the eager Is-raelites did at the new burst-ing foun-tains that poured from the smit-ten rock At last his spout grew thick and with a fright-ful roll and vomit he turned upon his back a corpse While the two heads-men were en-gaged in mak-ing fast cords to his flukes and in other ways get-ting the mass in readi-ness for tow-ing some con-ver-sa-tion en-sued between them â I won-der what the old man wan-ts with this lump of foul lard â said Stubb not without some dis-gust at the thought of hav-ing to do with so ig-no-ble a le-viathan â Wan-ts with it â said Flask coil-ing some spare line in the boatâ s bow â did you nev-er hear that the ship which but once has a Sperm Whaleâ s head hoist-ed on her star-board side and at the same time a Right Whaleâ s on the lar-board did you nev-er hear Stubb that that ship can nev-er after-wards cap-size â â Why not â I donâ t know but I heard that gam-boge ghost of a Fedal-lah say-ing so and he seems to know all about ship-sâ char-ms But I some-times think heâ ll charm the ship to no good at last I donâ t half like that chap Stubb Did you ever no-tice how that tusk of his is a sort of carved in-to a snakeâ s head Stubb â â Sink him I nev-er look at him at all but if ever I get a chance of a dark night and he stand-ing hard by the bul-warks and no one by look down there Flaskâ â point-ing in-to the sea with a pe-cu-liar mo-tion of both hand-sâ â Aye will I Flask I take that Fedal-lah to be the devil in dis-guise Do you believe that cock and bull sto-ry about his hav-ing been stowed away on board ship Heâ s the devil I say The rea-son why you donâ t see his tail is be-cause he tucks it up out of sight he car-ries it coiled away in his pock-et I guess Blast him now that I think of it heâ s al-ways want-ing oakum to stuff in-to the toes of his boots â â He sleeps in his boots donâ t he He has-nâ t got any ham-mock but Iâ ve seen him lay of nights in a coil of rig-ging â â No doubt and itâ s be-cause of his cursed tail he coils it down do ye see in the eye of the rig-ging â â Whatâ s the old man have so much to do with him for â â Strik-ing up a swap or a bar-gain I sup-pose â â Bar-gain â about what â â Why do ye see the old man is hard bent after that White Whale and the devil there is try-ing to come round him and get him to swap away his sil-ver watch or his soul or some-thing of that sort and then heâ ll sur-ren-der Mo-by Dick â â Pooh Stubb you are sky-lark-ing how can Fedal-lah do that â â I donâ t know Flask but the devil is a cu-ri-ous chap and a wicked one I tell ye Why they say as how he went a saun-ter-ing in-to the old flag ship once switch-ing his tail about devil-ish easy and gentle-man-like and in-quir-ing if the old gover-nor was at home Well he was at home and asked the devil what he want-ed The devil switch-ing his hoofs up and says â I want John â â What for â says the old gover-nor â What busi-ness is that of yours â says the devil get-ting mad â â I want to use him â â Take him â says the gover-norâ and by the Lord Flask if the devil did-nâ t give John the Asi-at-ic cholera be-fore he got through with him Iâ ll eat this whale in one mouth-ful But look sharpâ ainâ t you all ready there Well then pull ahead and letâ s get the whale along-side â â I think I re-mem-ber some such sto-ry as you were telling â said Flask when at last the two boats were slow-ly ad-vanc-ing with their bur-den towards the ship â but I canâ t re-mem-ber where â â Three Spa-niards Ad-ven-tures of those three bloody mind-ed solda-does Did ye read it there Flask I guess ye did â â No nev-er saw such a book heard of it though But now tell me Stubb do you sup-pose that that devil you was speak-ing of just now was the same you say is now on board the Pe-quod â â Am I the same man that helped kill this whale Does-nâ t the devil live for ever who ever heard that the devil was dead Did you ever see any par-son a wear-ing mourn-ing for the devil And if the devil has a latch key to get in-to the ad-mi-ralâ s cabin donâ t you sup-pose he can crawl in-to a port-hole Tell me that Mr Flask â â How old do you sup-pose Fedal-lah is Stubb â â Do you see that main-mast there â point-ing to the ship â well thatâ s the fig-ure one now take all the hoops in the Pe-quodâ s hold and string along in a row with that mast for oughts do you see well that would-nâ t be-gin to be Fedal-lahâ s age Nor all the coop-ers in creation could-nâ t show hoops enough to make oughts enough â â But see here Stubb I thought you a lit-tle boast-ed just now that you meant to give Fedal-lah a sea toss if you got a good chance Now if heâ s so old as all those hoops of yours come to and if he is go-ing to live for ever what good will it do to pitch him over-boardâ tell me that â Give him a good duck-ing any-how â â But heâ d crawl back â â Duck him again and keep duck-ing him â â Sup-pose he should take it in-to his head to duck you thoughâ yes and drown youâ what then â â I should like to see him try it Iâ d give him such a pair of black eyes that he would-nâ t dare to show his face in the ad-mi-ralâ s cabin again for a long while let alone down in the or-lop there where he lives and here-abouts on the up-per decks where he sneaks so much Damn the devil Flask so you sup-pose Iâ m afraid of the devil Whoâ s afraid of him ex-cept the old gover-nor who dares-nâ t catch him and put him in dou-ble dar-bies as he de-serves but lets him go about kid-nap-ping peo-ple aye and signed a bond with him that all the peo-ple the devil kid-napped heâ d roast for him Thereâ s a gover-nor â â Do you sup-pose Fedal-lah wan-ts to kid-nap Cap-tain Ahab â â Do I sup-pose it Youâ ll know it be-fore long Flask But I am go-ing now to keep a sharp look out on him and if I see any-thing very sus-pi-cious go-ing on Iâ ll just take him by the nape of his neck and sayâ Look here Beelze-bub you donâ t do it and if he makes any fuss by the Lord Iâ ll make a grab in-to his pock-et for his tail take it to the cap-stan and give him such a wrench-ing and heav-ing that his tail will come short off at the stumpâ do you see and then I rather guess when he finds him-self docked in that queer fash-ion heâ ll sneak off without the poor sat-is-fac-tion of feel-ing his tail between his legs â â And what will you do with the tail Stubb â â Do with it Sell it for an ox whip when we get home â what else â â Now do you mean what you say and have been say-ing all along Stubb â â Mean or not mean here we are at the ship â The boats were here hailed to tow the whale on the lar-board side where fluke chains and other ne-c-es-saries were al-ready pre-pared for se-cur-ing him â Did-nâ t I tell you so â said Flask â yes youâ ll soon see this right whaleâ s head hoist-ed up op-po-site that par-ma-cettiâ s â In good time Flaskâ s say-ing proved true As be-fore the Pe-quod steeply leaned over towards the sperm whaleâ s head now by the coun-ter-poise of both heads she re-gained her even keel though sore-ly strained you may well believe So when on one side you hoist in Lock-eâ s head you go over that way but now on the other side hoist in Kan-tâ s and you come back again but in very poor plight Thus some minds for ever keep trim-ming boat Oh ye fool-ish throw all th-ese thun-der heads over-board and then you will float light and right In dis-pos-ing of the body of a right whale when brought along-side the ship the same pre-lim-i-nary pro-ceed-ings com-mon-ly take place as in the case of a sperm whale on-ly in the lat-ter in-stance the head is cut off whole but in the former the lips and tongue are separate-ly re-moved and hoist-ed on deck with all the well known black bone at-tached to what is called the crown piece But noth-ing like this in the pre-sent case had been done The car-cas-es of both whales had dropped astern and the head laden ship not a lit-tle re-sem-bled a mule car-ry-ing a pair of over-bur-den-ing pan-niers Mean-time Fedal-lah was calm-ly eye-ing the right whaleâ s head and ever and anon glanc-ing from the deep wrin-kles there to the lines in his own hand And Ahab chanced so to stand that the Parsee oc-cu-pied his shad-ow while if the Parseeâ s shad-ow was there at all it seemed on-ly to blend with and length-en Ahabâ s As the crew toiled on La-p-lan-dish spec-u-la-tions were bandied among them con-cern-ing all th-ese pass-ing things CHAPTER 74 The Sperm Whaleâ s Headâ Con-trast-ed View Here now are two great whales lay-ing their heads to-geth-er let us join them and lay to-geth-er our own Of the grand order of fo-lio le-viathans the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale are by far the most note-wor-thy They are the on-ly whales reg-u-lar-ly hunt-ed by man To the Nan-tuck-eter they pre-sent the two ex-tremes of all the known va-ri-eties of the whale As the ex-ter-nal dif-fer-ence between them is main-ly ob-serv-able in their heads and as a head of each is this mo-ment hang-ing from the Pe-quodâ s side and as we may freely go from one to the other by mere-ly step-ping across the deck â where I should like to know will you ob-tain a bet-ter chance to study prac-ti-cal ce-tol-o-gy than here In the first place you are struck by the gen-er-al con-trast between th-ese heads Both are mas-sive enough in all con-science but there is a cer-tain math-e-mat-i-cal sym-me-try in the Sperm Whaleâ s which the Right Whaleâ s sad-ly lacks There is more char-ac-ter in the Sperm Whaleâ s head As you be-hold it you in-vol-un-tar-i-ly yield the im-mense su-pe-ri-or-i-ty to him in point of per-vad-ing dig-ni-ty In the pre-sent in-stance too this dig-ni-ty is height-ened by the pep-per and salt colour of his head at the sum-mit giv-ing to-ken of ad-vanced age and large ex-pe-ri-ence In short he is what the fish-er-men tech-ni-cal-ly call a â grey head-ed whale â Let us now note what is least dis-sim-i-lar in th-ese head-sâ name-ly the two most im-por-tant or-gans the eye and the ear Far back on the side of the head and low down near the an-gle of either whaleâ s jaw if you nar-row-ly search you will at last see a lash-less eye which you would fan-cy to be a young coltâ s eye so out of all pro-por-tion is it to the mag-ni-tude of the head Now from this pe-cu-liar side-way po-si-tion of the whaleâ s eyes it is plain that he can nev-er see an ob-ject which is ex-act-ly ahead no more than he can one ex-act-ly astern In a word the po-si-tion of the whaleâ s eyes cor-re-sponds to that of a manâ s ears and you may fan-cy for your-self how it would fare with you did you side-ways sur-vey ob-jec-ts through your ears You would find that you could on-ly com-mand some thir-ty de-grees of vi-sion in ad-vance of the straight side line of sight and about thir-ty more be-hind it If your bit-ter-est foe were walk-ing straight towards you with dag-ger uplift-ed in broad day you would not be able to see him any more than if he were steal-ing upon you from be-hind In a word you would have two backs so to speak but at the same time al-so two fron-ts side fron-ts for what is it that makes the front of a manâ what in-deed but his eyes More-over while in most other an-i-mals that I can now think of the eyes are so plant-ed as im-per-cep-ti-bly to blend their visu-al pow-er so as to pro-duce one pic-ture and not two to the brain the pe-cu-liar po-si-tion of the whaleâ s eyes ef-fec-tu-al-ly di-vid-ed as they are by many cu-bic feet of sol-id head which tow-ers between them like a great moun-tain separat-ing two lakes in val-leys this of course must whol-ly separate the im-pres-sions which each in-de-pen-dent or-gan im-parts The whale there-fore must see one distinct pic-ture on this side and another distinct pic-ture on that side while all between must be pro-found dark-ness and noth-ing-ness to him Man may in ef-fect be said to look out on the world from a sen-try box with two joined sash-es for his win-dow But with the whale th-ese two sash-es are separate-ly insert-ed mak-ing two distinct win-dows but sad-ly im-pair-ing the view This pe-cu-liar-i-ty of the whaleâ s eyes is a thing al-ways to be borne in mind in the fish-ery and to be re-mem-bered by the read-er in some sub-se-quent scenes A cu-ri-ous and most puz-zling ques-tion might be start-ed con-cern-ing this visu-al mat-ter as touch-ing the Le-viathan But I must be con-tent with a hint So long as a manâ s eyes are open in the light the act of see-ing is in-vol-un-tary that is he can-not then help me-chan-i-cal-ly see-ing what-ev-er ob-jec-ts are be-fore him Nev-er-the-less any oneâ s ex-pe-ri-ence will teach him that though he can take in an undis-crim-i-nat-ing sweep of things at one glance it is quite im-pos-si-ble for him at-ten-tive-ly and com-plete-ly to ex-am-ine any two thingsâ how-ev-er large or how-ev-er smal-lâ at one and the same in-stant of time nev-er mind if they lie side by side and touch each other But if you now come to separate th-ese two ob-jec-ts and sur-round each by a cir-cle of pro-found dark-ness then in order to see one of them in such a man-ner as to bring your mind to bear on it the other will be ut-ter-ly ex-clud-ed from your con-tem-po-rary con-scious-ness How is it then with the whale True both his eyes in them-selves must si-mul-ta-ne-ous-ly act but is his brain so much more com-pre-hen-sive com-bin-ing and sub-tle than manâ s that he can at the same mo-ment of time at-ten-tive-ly ex-am-ine two distinct prospec-ts one on one side of him and the other in an ex-act-ly op-po-site direc-tion If he can then is it as marvel-lous a thing in him as if a man were able si-mul-ta-ne-ous-ly to go through the de-mon-stra-tions of two distinct prob-lems in Eu-clid Nor strict-ly in-ves-ti-gat-ed is there any in-con-gruity in this com-par-i-son It may be but an idle whim but it has al-ways seemed to me that the ex-traor-di-nary vacil-la-tions of move-ment dis-played by some whales when be-set by three or four boats the timid-i-ty and li-a-bil-i-ty to queer frights so com-mon to such whales I think that all this indi-rect-ly pro-ceeds from the help-less per-plex-i-ty of vo-li-tion in which their di-vid-ed and di-a-met-ri-cal-ly op-po-site pow-ers of vi-sion must in-volve them But the ear of the whale is full as cu-ri-ous as the eye If you are an en-tire stranger to their race you might hunt over th-ese two heads for hours and nev-er dis-cov-er that or-gan The ear has no ex-ter-nal leaf what-ev-er and in-to the hole it-self you can hard-ly insert a quill so won-drous-ly minute is it It is lodged a lit-tle be-hind the eye With re-spect to their ears this im-por-tant dif-fer-ence is to be ob-served between the sperm whale and the right While the ear of the former has an ex-ter-nal open-ing that of the lat-ter is en-tire-ly and even-ly covered over with a mem-brane so as to be quite im-per-cep-ti-ble from without Is it not cu-ri-ous that so vast a be-ing as the whale should see the world through so small an eye and hear the thun-der through an ear which is smaller than a hareâ s But if his eyes were broad as the lens of Her-schelâ s great te-le-scope and his ears ca-pa-cious as the porch-es of cathe-drals would that make him any longer of sight or sharp-er of hear-ing Not at all â Why then do you try to â en-largeâ your mind Subtilize it Let us now with what-ev-er lev-ers and steam engines we have at hand cant over the sperm whaleâ s head that it may lie bot-tom up then as-cend-ing by a lad-der to the sum-mit have a peep down the mouth and were it not that the body is now com-plete-ly separat-ed from it with a lan-tern we might descend in-to the great Ken-tucky Mam-moth Cave of his stomach But let us hold on here by this tooth and look about us where we are What a real-ly beau-ti-ful and chaste look-ing mouth from floor to ceil-ing lined or rather papered with a glis-ten-ing white mem-brane glossy as bri-dal satins But come out now and look at this por-ten-tous low-er jaw which seems like the long nar-row lid of an im-mense snuff box with the hinge at one end in-stead of one side If you pry it up so as to get it over-head and ex-pose its rows of teeth it seems a ter-rif-ic portcullis and such alas it proves to many a poor wight in the fish-ery upon whom th-ese spikes fall with im-pal-ing force But far more ter-ri-ble is it to be-hold when fath-oms down in the sea you see some sulky whale float-ing there sus-pend-ed with his prodi-gious jaw some fif-teen feet long hang-ing straight down at right an-gles with his body for all the world like a shipâ s jib boom This whale is not dead he is on-ly dispir-it-ed out of sorts per-haps hypochon-dri-ac and so supine that the hinges of his jaw have re-laxed leav-ing him there in that un-gain-ly sort of plight a re-proach to all his tribe who must no doubt im-pre-cate lock jaws upon him In most cas-es this low-er jawâ be-ing easi-ly un-hinged by a prac-tised artistâ is disen-gaged and hoist-ed on deck for the pur-pose of ex-tract-ing the ivory teeth and fur-nish-ing a sup-ply of that hard white whale-bone with which the fish-er-men fash-ion all sorts of cu-ri-ous ar-ti-cles in-clud-ing canes um-brel-la stocks and han-dles to rid-ing whips With a long weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board as if it were an an-chor and when the prop-er time comesâ some few days after the other workâ Quee-queg Dag-goo and Tashtego be-ing all ac-com-plished den-tists are set to draw-ing teeth With a keen cut-ting spade Quee-queg lances the gums then the jaw is lashed down to ring-bolts and a tack-le be-ing rigged from aloft they drag out th-ese teeth as Michi-gan ox-en drag stumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands There are gen-er-al-ly forty two teeth in all in old whales much worn down but un-de-cayed nor filled after our ar-ti-fi-cial fash-ion The jaw is after-wards sawn in-to slabs and piled away like joists for build-ing hous-es CHAPTER 75 The Right Whaleâ s Headâ Con-trast-ed View Cross-ing the deck let us now have a good long look at the Right Whaleâ s head As in gen-er-al shape the noble Sperm Whaleâ s head may be com-pared to a Ro-man war char-i-ot espe-cial-ly in front where it is so broad-ly round-ed so at a broad view the Right Whaleâ s head bears a rather inel-e-gant re-sem-blance to a gi-gan-tic gal-liot toed shoe Two hun-dred years ago an old Dutch voy-ager likened its shape to that of a shoe-mak-erâ s last And in this same last or shoe that old wo-man of the nurs-ery tale with the swarm-ing brood might very com-fort-ably be lodged she and all her proge-ny But as you come nearer to this great head it be-gins to as-sume dif-fer-ent aspec-ts ac-cord-ing to your point of view If you stand on its sum-mit and look at th-ese two F shaped spout-holes you would take the whole head for an enor-mous bass vi-ol and th-ese spir-a-cles the aper-tures in its sound-ing board Then again if you fix your eye upon this strange crest-ed comb like in-crus-ta-tion on the top of the massâ this green bar-na-cled thing which the Green-lan-ders call the â crown â and the South-ern fish-ers the â bon-netâ of the Right Whale fix-ing your eyes sole-ly on this you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak with a birdâ s nest in its crotch At any rate when you watch those live crabs that nes-tle here on this bon-net such an idea will be al-most sure to oc-cur to you un-less in-deed your fan-cy has been fixed by the tech-ni-cal term â crownâ al-so bestowed upon it in which case you will take great in-ter-est in think-ing how this mighty mon-ster is ac-tu-al-ly a di-ademed king of the sea whose green crown has been put to-geth-er for him in this marvel-lous man-ner But if this whale be a king he is a very sulky look-ing fel-low to grace a di-a-dem Look at that hang-ing low-er lip what a huge sulk and pout is there a sulk and pout by car-pen-terâ s mea-sure-ment about twen-ty feet long and five feet deep a sulk and pout that will yield you some 5 gal-lons of oil and more A great pi-ty now that this un-for-tu-nate whale should be hare lipped The fis-sure is about a foot across Prob-a-bly the mother dur-ing an im-por-tant in-ter-val was sail-ing down the Peru-vian coast when earthquakes caused the beach to gape Over this lip as over a slip-pery thresh-old we now slide in-to the mouth Upon my word were I at Mack-i-naw I should take this to be the in-side of an In-di-an wig-wam Good Lord is this the road that Jon-ah went The roof is about twelve feet high and runs to a pret-ty sharp an-gle as if there were a reg-u-lar ridge pole there while th-ese ribbed arched hairy sides pre-sent us with those won-drous half ver-ti-cal scimetar shaped slats of whale-bone say three hun-dred on a side which depend-ing from the up-per part of the head or crown bone form those Vene-tian blinds which have else-where been cur-so-ri-ly men-tioned The edges of th-ese bones are fringed with hairy fi-bres through which the Right Whale strains the water and in whose in-tri-ca-cies he re-tains the small fish when open-mouthed he goes through the seas of brit in feed-ing time In the cen-tral blinds of bone as they stand in their nat-u-ral order there are cer-tain cu-ri-ous marks curves hol-lows and ridges where-by some whale-men cal-cu-late the crea-tureâ s age as the age of an oak by its cir-cu-lar rings Though the cer-tain-ty of this cri-te-ri-on is far from de-mon-stra-ble yet it has the sa-vor of ana-log-i-cal prob-a-bil-i-ty At any rate if we yield to it we must grant a far greater age to the Right Whale than at first glance will seem rea-son-able In old times there seem to have pre-vailed the most cu-ri-ous fan-cies con-cern-ing th-ese blinds One voy-ager in Pur-chas cal-ls them the won-drous â whisker-sâ in-side of the whaleâ s mouth another â hogsâ bristlesâ a third old gentle-man in Hack-luyt us-es the fol-low-ing ele-gant lan-guage â There are about two hun-dred and fifty fins grow-ing on each side of his up-per chop which arch over his tongue on each side of his mouth â This re-minds us that the Right Whale real-ly has a sort of whisker or rather a mous-tache con-sist-ing of a few scat-tered white hairs on the up-per part of the outer end of the low-er jaw Some-times th-ese tufts im-part a rather bri-g-an-dish ex-pres-sion to his other-wise solemn coun-te-nance As every one knows th-ese same â hogsâ bris-tles â â fins â â whiskers â â blinds â or what-ev-er you please fur-nish to the ladies their busks and other stiff-en-ing con-trivances But in this par-tic-u-lar the de-mand has long been on the de-cline It was in Queen An-neâ s time that the bone was in its glo-ry the farthin-gale be-ing then all the fash-ion And as those an-cient dames moved about gai-ly though in the jaws of the whale as you may say even so in a show-er with the like thought-less-ness do we nowa-days fly un-der the same jaws for pro-tec-tion the um-brel-la be-ing a tent spread over the same bone But now for-get all about blinds and whiskers for a mo-ment and stand-ing in the Right Whaleâ s mouth look around you afresh See-ing all th-ese colon-nades of bone so me-thod-i-cal-ly ranged about would you not think you were in-side of the great Haar-lem or-gan and gaz-ing upon its thou-sand pipes For a car-pet to the or-gan we have a rug of the softest Turkeyâ the tongue which is glued as it were to the floor of the mouth It is very fat and ten-der and apt to tear in pieces in hoist-ing it on deck This par-tic-u-lar tongue now be-fore us at a pass-ing glance I should say it was a six bar-rel-er that is it will yield you about that amount of oil Ere this you must have plain-ly seen the truth of what I start-ed withâ that the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale have al-most en-tire-ly dif-fer-ent heads To sum up then in the Right Whaleâ s there is no great well of sperm no ivory teeth at all no long slen-der mandible of a low-er jaw like the Sperm Whaleâ s Nor in the Sperm Whale are there any of those blinds of bone no huge low-er lip and scarce-ly any-thing of a tongue Again the Right Whale has two ex-ter-nal spout holes the Sperm Whale on-ly one Look your last now on th-ese ven-er-a-ble hood-ed heads while they yet lie to-geth-er for one will soon sink un-record-ed in the sea the other will not be very long in fol-low-ing Can you catch the ex-pres-sion of the Sperm Whaleâ s there It is the same he died with on-ly some of the longer wrin-kles in the fore-head seem now fad-ed away I think his broad brow to be full of a prair-ie like placid-i-ty born of a spec-u-la-tive in-dif-fer-ence as to death But mark the other headâ s ex-pres-sion See that amaz-ing low-er lip pressed by ac-ci-dent against the ves-selâ s side so as firm-ly to em-brace the jaw Does not this whole head seem to speak of an enor-mous prac-ti-cal res-o-lu-tion in fac-ing death This Right Whale I take to have been a Sto-ic the Sperm Whale a Pla-to-ni-an who might have tak-en up Spinoza in his lat-ter years CHAPTER 76 The Bat-ter-ing Ram Ere quit-ting for the nonce the Sperm Whaleâ s head I would have you as a sen-si-ble phys-i-ol-o-gist sim-plyâ par-tic-u-lar-ly re-mark its front aspect in all its com-pact-ed col-lect-ed-ness I would have you in-ves-ti-gate it now with the sole view of form-ing to your-self some unex-ag-ger-at-ed in-tel-li-gent es-ti-mate of what-ev-er bat-ter-ing ram pow-er may be lodged there Here is a vi-tal point for you must either sat-is-fac-to-ri-ly set-tle this mat-ter with your-self or for ever re-main an in-fi-del as to one of the most ap-palling but not the less true even-ts per-haps any-where to be found in all record-ed his-to-ry You ob-serve that in the or-di-nary swim-ming po-si-tion of the Sperm Whale the front of his head pre-sen-ts an al-most whol-ly ver-ti-cal plane to the water you ob-serve that the low-er part of that front slopes con-sid-er-ably back-wards so as to fur-nish more of a re-treat for the long sock-et which re-ceives the boom like low-er jaw you ob-serve that the mouth is en-tire-ly un-der the head much in the same way in-deed as though your own mouth were en-tire-ly un-der your chin More-over you ob-serve that the whale has no ex-ter-nal nose and that what nose he hasâ his spout holeâ is on the top of his head you ob-serve that his eyes and ears are at the sides of his head near-ly one third of his en-tire length from the front Where-fore you must now have per-ceived that the front of the Sperm Whaleâ s head is a dead blind wall without a sin-gle or-gan or ten-der promi-nence of any sort what-so-ev-er Fur-ther-more you are now to con-sid-er that on-ly in the ex-treme low-er back-ward slop-ing part of the front of the head is there the slight-est ves-tige of bone and not till you get near twen-ty feet from the fore-head do you come to the full cra-nial devel-op-ment So that this whole enor-mous bone-less mass is as one wad Fi-nal-ly though as will soon be re-vealed its con-tents part-ly com-prise the most del-i-cate oil yet you are now to be ap-prised of the na-ture of the sub-stance which so im-preg-nably in-vests all that ap-par-ent ef-fem-i-na-cy In some pre-vi-ous place I have de-scribed to you how the blub-ber wraps the body of the whale as the rind wraps an orange Just so with the head but with this dif-fer-ence about the head this en-ve-lope though not so thick is of a bone-less tough-ness ines-timable by any man who has not han-dled it The sever-est point-ed har-poon the sharpest lance dart-ed by the strongest hu-man arm im-po-tent-ly re-bounds from it It is as though the fore-head of the Sperm Whale were paved with hors-esâ hoofs I do not think that any sen-sa-tion lurks in it Be-think your-self al-so of another thing When two large load-ed In-di-a-men chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks what do the sailors do They do not sus-pend between them at the point of com-ing con-tact any mere-ly hard sub-stance like iron or wood No they hold there a large round wad of tow and cork en-veloped in the thick-est and tough-est of ox hide That brave-ly and un-in-jured takes the jam which would have snapped all their oak-en hand-spikes and iron crow bars By it-self this suf-fi-cient-ly il-lus-trates the ob-vi-ous fact I drive at But sup-ple-men-tary to this it has hy-po-thet-i-cal-ly oc-curred to me that as or-di-nary fish possess what is called a swim-ming blad-der in them ca-pable at will of dis-ten-sion or con-trac-tion and as the Sperm Whale as far as I know has no such pro-vi-sion in him con-sid-er-ing too the other-wise in-ex-pli-ca-ble man-ner in which he now de-press-es his head al-to-geth-er be-neath the sur-face and anon swims with it high el-e-vat-ed out of the water con-sid-er-ing the unob-struct-ed elas-tic-i-ty of its en-ve-lope con-sid-er-ing the unique in-te-ri-or of his head it has hy-po-thet-i-cal-ly oc-curred to me I say that those mys-ti-cal lung celled hon-ey-combs there may pos-si-bly have some hither-to un-known and un-sus-pect-ed con-nex-ion with the outer air so as to be sus-cep-ti-ble to at-mo-spher-ic dis-ten-sion and con-trac-tion If this be so fan-cy the ir-re-sistible-ness of that might to which the most im-pal-pa-ble and destruc-tive of all ele-men-ts con-tributes Now mark Un-erring-ly im-pelling this dead im-preg-nable un-in-jurable wall and this most buoy-ant thing within there swims be-hind it all a mass of tre-men-dous life on-ly to be ad-e-quate-ly es-ti-mat-ed as piled wood isâ by the cord and all obe-di-ent to one vo-li-tion as the smallest in-sect So that when I shall hereafter de-tail to you all the spe-cial-i-ties and con-cen-tra-tions of po-ten-cy every-where lurk-ing in this ex-pan-sive mon-ster when I shall show you some of his more in-con-sid-er-able brain-ing feats I trust you will have re-nounced all ig-no-rant in-creduli-ty and be ready to abide by this that though the Sperm Whale stove a pas-sage through the Isth-mus of Darien and mixed the At-lantic with the Pa-cif-ic you would not el-e-vate one hair of your eye brow For un-less you own the whale you are but a provin-cial and sen-ti-men-tal-ist in Truth But clear Truth is a thing for sala-man-der giants on-ly to en-counter how small the chances for the provin-cials then What be-fell the weak-ling youth lift-ing the dread god-dessâ s veil at Lais CHAPTER 77 The Great Hei-del-burgh Tun Now comes the Bal-ing of the Case But to com-pre-hend it aright you must know some-thing of the cu-ri-ous in-ter-nal struc-ture of the thing oper-at-ed upon Re-gard-ing the Sperm Whaleâ s head as a sol-id ob-long you may on an in-clined plane side-ways di-vide it in-to two quoins where-of the low-er is the bony struc-ture form-ing the cra-ni-um and jaws and the up-per an unc-tu-ous mass whol-ly free from bones its broad for-ward end form-ing the ex-pand-ed ver-ti-cal ap-par-ent fore-head of the whale At the mid-dle of the fore-head hor-i-zon-tal-ly sub-di-vide this up-per quoin and then you have two al-most equal parts which be-fore were nat-u-ral-ly di-vid-ed by an in-ter-nal wall of a thick tendi-nous sub-stance Quoin is not a Eu-clidean term It be-longs to the pure nau-ti-cal math-e-mat-ics I know not that it has been de-fined be-fore A quoin is a sol-id which dif-fers from a wedge in hav-ing its sharp end formed by the steep in-cli-na-tion of one side in-stead of the mu-tu-al taper-ing of both sides The low-er sub-di-vid-ed part called the junk is one im-mense hon-ey-comb of oil formed by the cross-ing and re-cross-ing in-to ten thou-sand in-fil-trat-ed cel-ls of tough elas-tic white fi-bres through-out its whole ex-tent The up-per part known as the Case may be re-gard-ed as the great Hei-del-burgh Tun of the Sperm Whale And as that fa-mous great tierce is mys-ti-cal-ly carved in front so the whaleâ s vast plait-ed fore-head for-ms in-nu-mer-able strange de-vices for the em-blem-at-i-cal adorn-ment of his won-drous tun More-over as that of Hei-del-burgh was al-ways re-plen-ished with the most ex-cel-lent of the wines of the Rhen-ish val-leys so the tun of the whale con-tains by far the most pre-cious of all his oi-ly vin-tages name-ly the high-ly prized sper-ma-ceti in its ab-so-lute-ly pure limpid and odorif-er-ous state Nor is this pre-cious sub-stance found unal-loyed in any other part of the crea-ture Though in life it re-mains per-fect-ly flu-id yet upon ex-po-sure to the air after death it soon be-gins to con-crete send-ing forth beau-ti-ful crys-talline shoots as when the first thin del-i-cate ice is just form-ing in water A large whaleâ s case gen-er-al-ly yields about five hun-dred gal-lons of sperm though from unavoid-able cir-cum-stances con-sid-er-able of it is spilled leaks and drib-bles away or is other-wise ir-re-vo-ca-bly lost in the tick-lish busi-ness of se-cur-ing what you can I know not with what fine and cost-ly ma-te-ri-al the Hei-del-burgh Tun was coat-ed within but in su-perla-tive rich-ness that coat-ing could not pos-si-bly have com-pared with the silken pearl coloured mem-brane like the lin-ing of a fine pelisse form-ing the in-ner sur-face of the Sperm Whaleâ s case It will have been seen that the Hei-del-burgh Tun of the Sperm Whale em-braces the en-tire length of the en-tire top of the head and sinceâ as has been else-where set forthâ the head em-braces one third of the whole length of the crea-ture then set-ting that length down at eighty feet for a good sized whale you have more than twen-ty six feet for the depth of the tun when it is length-wise hoist-ed up and down against a shipâ s side As in de-cap-i-tat-ing the whale the oper-a-torâ s in-stru-ment is brought close to the spot where an en-trance is sub-se-quent-ly forced in-to the sper-ma-ceti magazine he has there-fore to be un-com-mon-ly heed-ful lest a care-less un-time-ly stroke should in-vade the sanc-tu-ary and wast-ing-ly let out its in-valu-able con-tents It is this de-cap-i-tat-ed end of the head al-so which is at last el-e-vat-ed out of the water and re-tained in that po-si-tion by the enor-mous cut-ting tack-les whose hem-pen com-bi-na-tions on one side make quite a wilder-ness of ropes in that quar-ter Thus much be-ing said at-tend now I pray you to that marvel-lous andâ in this par-tic-u-lar in-stanceâ al-most fatal oper-a-tion where-by the Sperm Whaleâ s great Hei-del-burgh Tun is tapped CHAPTER 78 Cis-tern and Buck-ets Nim-ble as a cat Tashtego moun-ts aloft and without al-ter-ing his erect pos-ture runs straight out upon the over-hang-ing main-yard arm to the part where it ex-act-ly pro-jec-ts over the hoist-ed Tun He has car-ried with him a light tack-le called a whip con-sist-ing of on-ly two parts trav-el-ling through a sin-gle sheaved block Se-cur-ing this block so that it hangs down from the yard arm he swings one end of the rope till it is caught and firm-ly held by a hand on deck Then hand over hand down the other part the In-di-an drops through the air till dex-ter-ous-ly he lands on the sum-mit of the head Thereâ still high el-e-vat-ed above the rest of the com-pa-ny to whom he vi-va-cious-ly criesâ he seems some Turk-ish Muezzin calling the good peo-ple to pray-ers from the top of a tow-er A short han-dled sharp spade be-ing sent up to him he dili-gent-ly search-es for the prop-er place to be-gin break-ing in-to the Tun In this busi-ness he pro-ceeds very heed-ful-ly like a trea-sure hunter in some old house sound-ing the wal-ls to find where the gold is ma-soned in By the time this cau-tious search is over a stout iron bound buck-et pre-cise-ly like a well buck-et has been at-tached to one end of the whip while the other end be-ing stretched across the deck is there held by two or three alert hands Th-ese last now hoist the buck-et within grasp of the In-di-an to whom another per-son has reached up a very long pole Insert-ing this pole in-to the buck-et Tashtego down-ward guides the buck-et in-to the Tun till it en-tire-ly dis-ap-pears then giv-ing the word to the sea-men at the whip up comes the buck-et again all bub-bling like a dairy maidâ s pail of new milk Care-ful-ly low-ered from its height the full freight-ed ves-sel is caught by an ap-point-ed hand and quick-ly emp-tied in-to a large tub Then re-mount-ing aloft it again goes through the same round un-til the deep cis-tern will yield no more Towards the end Tashtego has to ram his long pole harder and harder and deep-er and deep-er in-to the Tun un-til some twen-ty feet of the pole have gone down Now the peo-ple of the Pe-quod had been bal-ing some time in this way sev-er-al tubs had been filled with the fra-grant sperm when all at once a queer ac-ci-dent hap-pened Whether it was that Tashtego that wild In-di-an was so heed-less and reck-less as to let go for a mo-ment his one hand-ed hold on the great cabled tack-les sus-pend-ing the head or whether the place where he stood was so treach-er-ous and oozy or whether the Evil One him-self would have it to fall out so without stat-ing his par-tic-u-lar rea-sons how it was ex-act-ly there is no telling now but on a sud-den as the eight-i-eth or nineti-eth buck-et came suck-ing-ly upâ my God poor Tashte-goâ like the twin re-cip-ro-cat-ing buck-et in a ver-i-ta-ble well dropped head fore-most down in-to this great Tun of Hei-del-burgh and with a hor-ri-ble oi-ly gur-gling went clean out of sight â Man over-board â cried Dag-goo who amid the gen-er-al con-ster-na-tion first came to his sens-es â Swing the buck-et this way â and put-ting one foot in-to it so as the bet-ter to se-cure his slip-pery hand hold on the whip it-self the hois-ters ran him high up to the top of the head al-most be-fore Tashtego could have reached its in-te-ri-or bot-tom Mean-time there was a ter-ri-ble tu-mult Look-ing over the side they saw the be-fore life-less head throb-bing and heav-ing just below the sur-face of the sea as if that mo-ment seized with some mo-men-tous idea where-as it was on-ly the poor In-di-an un-con-scious-ly re-veal-ing by those strug-gles the per-ilous depth to which he had sunk At this in-stant while Dag-goo on the sum-mit of the head was clear-ing the whipâ which had some-how got foul of the great cut-ting tack-lesâ a sharp crack-ing noise was heard and to the un-speak-able hor-ror of all one of the two enor-mous hooks sus-pend-ing the head tore out and with a vast vi-bra-tion the enor-mous mass side-ways swung till the drunk ship reeled and shook as if smit-ten by an ice-berg The one re-main-ing hook upon which the en-tire strain now depend-ed seemed every in-stant to be on the point of giv-ing way an event still more like-ly from the vi-o-lent mo-tions of the head â Come down come down â yelled the sea-men to Dag-goo but with one hand hold-ing on to the heavy tack-les so that if the head should drop he would still re-main sus-pend-ed the ne-gro hav-ing cleared the foul line rammed down the buck-et in-to the now col-lapsed well mean-ing that the buried har-pooneer should grasp it and so be hoist-ed out â In heav-enâ s name man â cried Stubb â are you ram-ming home a car-tridge there â Avast How will that help him jam-ming that iron bound buck-et on top of his head Avast will ye â â Stand clear of the tack-le â cried a voice like the burst-ing of a rock-et Al-most in the same in-stant with a thun-der boom the enor-mous mass dropped in-to the sea like Ni-a-garaâ s Table Rock in-to the whirlpool the sud-den-ly relieved hull rolled away from it to far down her glit-ter-ing cop-per and all caught their breath as half swing-ingâ now over the sailorsâ heads and now over the waterâ Dag-goo through a thick mist of spray was dim-ly be-held cling-ing to the pen-du-lous tack-les while poor buried alive Tashtego was sink-ing ut-ter-ly down to the bot-tom of the sea But hard-ly had the blind-ing va-por cleared away when a naked fig-ure with a board-ing sword in his hand was for one swift mo-ment seen hover-ing over the bul-warks The next a loud splash an-nounced that my brave Quee-queg had dived to the res-cue One packed rush was made to the side and every eye count-ed every rip-ple as mo-ment fol-lowed mo-ment and no sign of either the sinker or the div-er could be seen Some hands now jumped in-to a boat along-side and pushed a lit-tle off from the ship â Ha ha â cried Dag-goo all at once from his now qui-et swing-ing perch over-head and look-ing fur-ther off from the side we saw an arm thrust upright from the blue waves a sight strange to see as an arm thrust forth from the grass over a grave â Both both â it is both â â cried Dag-goo again with a joy-ful shout and soon after Quee-queg was seen bold-ly strik-ing out with one hand and with the other clutch-ing the long hair of the In-di-an Drawn in-to the wait-ing boat they were quick-ly brought to the deck but Tashtego was long in com-ing to and Quee-queg did not look very brisk Now how had this noble res-cue been ac-com-plished Why div-ing after the slow-ly descend-ing head Quee-queg with his keen sword had made side lunges near its bot-tom so as to scut-tle a large hole there then drop-ping his sword had thrust his long arm far in-wards and up-wards and so hauled out poor Tash by the head He averred that upon first thrust-ing in for him a leg was pre-sent-ed but well know-ing that that was not as it ought to be and might oc-ca-sion great trou-ble â he had thrust back the leg and by a dex-ter-ous heave and toss had wrought a som-er-set upon the In-di-an so that with the next tri-al he came forth in the good old wayâ head fore-most As for the great head it-self that was do-ing as well as could be ex-pect-ed And thus through the courage and great skill in ob-stet-rics of Quee-queg the de-liv-er-ance or rather de-liv-ery of Tashtego was suc-cess-ful-ly ac-com-plished in the teeth too of the most un-to-ward and ap-par-ent-ly hope-less im-ped-i-men-ts which is a les-son by no means to be for-got-ten Mid-wifery should be taught in the same course with fenc-ing and box-ing rid-ing and row-ing I know that this queer ad-ven-ture of the Gay Head-erâ s will be sure to seem in-cred-i-ble to some lands-men though they them-selves may have either seen or heard of some oneâ s falling in-to a cis-tern ashore an ac-ci-dent which not sel-dom hap-pens and with much less rea-son too than the In-di-anâ s con-sid-er-ing the ex-ceed-ing slip-per-i-ness of the curb of the Sperm Whaleâ s well But per-ad-ven-ture it may be sa-ga-cious-ly urged how is this We thought the tis-sued in-fil-trat-ed head of the Sperm Whale was the light-est and most corky part about him and yet thou mak-est it sink in an ele-ment of a far greater spe-cif-ic grav-i-ty than it-self We have thee there Not at all but I have ye for at the time poor Tash fell in the case had been near-ly emp-tied of its lighter con-tents leav-ing lit-tle but the dense tendi-nous wall of the wel-lâ a dou-ble weld-ed ham-mered sub-stance as I have be-fore said much heav-ier than the sea water and a lump of which sinks in it like lead al-most But the ten-den-cy to rapid sink-ing in this sub-stance was in the pre-sent in-stance ma-te-ri-al-ly coun-ter-act-ed by the other parts of the head re-main-ing un-de-tached from it so that it sank very slow-ly and de-lib-er-ate-ly in-deed af-ford-ing Quee-queg a fair chance for per-form-ing his agile ob-stet-rics on the run as you may say Yes it was a run-ning de-liv-ery so it was Now had Tashtego per-ished in that head it had been a very pre-cious per-ish-ing smoth-ered in the very whitest and dain-ti-est of fra-grant sper-ma-ceti coffined hearsed and tombed in the se-cret in-ner cham-ber and sanc-tum sanc-to-rum of the whale On-ly one sweet-er end can read-i-ly be re-calledâ the de-li-cious death of an Ohio honey hunter who seek-ing honey in the crotch of a hol-low tree found such ex-ceed-ing store of it that lean-ing too far over it sucked him in so that he died em-balmed How many think ye have like-wise fallen in-to Pla-toâ s honey head and sweet-ly per-ished there CHAPTER 79 The Prair-ie To scan the lines of his face or feel the bumps on the head of this Le-viathan this is a thing which no Phys-iog-nomist or Phre-nol-o-gist has as yet un-der-tak-en Such an en-ter-prise would seem al-most as hope-ful as for La-vater to have scru-ti-nized the wrin-kles on the Rock of Gi-bral-tar or for Gall to have mount-ed a lad-der and ma-nip-u-lat-ed the Dome of the Pan-theon Still in that fa-mous work of his La-vater not on-ly treats of the var-i-ous faces of men but al-so at-ten-tive-ly stud-ies the faces of hors-es birds ser-pen-ts and fish and dwells in de-tail upon the mod-i-fi-ca-tions of ex-pres-sion dis-cernible there-in Nor have Gall and his dis-ci-ple Spurzheim failed to throw out some hin-ts touch-ing the phreno-log-i-cal char-ac-ter-is-tics of other be-ings than man There-fore though I am but ill qual-i-fied for a pioneer in the ap-pli-ca-tion of th-ese two se-mi sciences to the whale I will do my en-deav-or I try all things I achieve what I can Phys-iog-nom-i-cal-ly re-gard-ed the Sperm Whale is an ano-ma-lous crea-ture He has no prop-er nose And since the nose is the cen-tral and most con-spic-u-ous of the fea-tures and since it per-haps most mod-i-fies and fi-nal-ly con-trols their com-bined ex-pres-sion hence it would seem that its en-tire ab-sence as an ex-ter-nal ap-pendage must very large-ly af-fect the coun-te-nance of the whale For as in land-scape gar-den-ing a spire cupo-la mon-u-ment or tow-er of some sort is deemed al-most indis-pens-able to the com-ple-tion of the scene so no face can be phys-iog-nom-i-cal-ly in keep-ing without the el-e-vat-ed open work bel-fry of the nose Dash the nose from Phidi-asâ s mar-ble Jove and what a sor-ry re-main-der Nev-er-the-less Le-viathan is of so mighty a mag-ni-tude all his pro-por-tions are so state-ly that the same de-fi-cien-cy which in the sculp-tured Jove were hideous in him is no blem-ish at all Nay it is an added gran-deur A nose to the whale would have been im-per-ti-nent As on your phys-iog-nom-i-cal voy-age you sail round his vast head in your jol-ly boat your noble con-cep-tions of him are nev-er in-sult-ed by the re-flec-tion that he has a nose to be pulled A pesti-lent con-ceit which so often will in-sist upon ob-trud-ing even when be-hold-ing the might-i-est roy-al bea-dle on his throne In some par-tic-u-lars per-haps the most im-pos-ing phys-iog-nom-i-cal view to be had of the Sperm Whale is that of the full front of his head This aspect is sublime In thought a fine hu-man brow is like the East when trou-bled with the morn-ing In the re-pose of the pas-ture the curled brow of the bull has a touch of the grand in it Push-ing heavy can-non up moun-tain de-files the ele-phan-tâ s brow is ma-jes-tic Hu-man or an-i-mal the mys-ti-cal brow is as that great gold-en seal af-fixed by the Ger-man em-per-ors to their de-crees It sig-ni-fiesâ â God done this day by my hand â But in most crea-tures nay in man him-self very often the brow is but a mere strip of alpine land ly-ing along the snow line Few are the fore-heads which like Shake-speareâ s or Me-lanc-thonâ s rise so high and descend so low that the eyes them-selves seem clear eter-nal tide-less moun-tain lakes and all above them in the fore-headâ s wrin-kles you seem to track the antlered thoughts descend-ing there to drink as the High-land hun-ters track the snow prin-ts of the deer But in the great Sperm Whale this high and mighty god like dig-ni-ty in-her-ent in the brow is so im-mense-ly am-pli-fied that gaz-ing on it in that full front view you feel the De-ity and the dread pow-ers more forcibly than in be-hold-ing any other ob-ject in liv-ing na-ture For you see no one point pre-cise-ly not one distinct fea-ture is re-vealed no nose eyes ears or mouth no face he has none prop-er noth-ing but that one broad fir-ma-ment of a fore-head pleat-ed with rid-dles dumbly low-er-ing with the doom of boats and ships and men Nor in pro-file does this won-drous brow di-min-ish though that way viewed its gran-deur does not dom-i-neer upon you so In pro-file you plain-ly per-ceive that hor-i-zon-tal se-mi cres-cen-tic de-pres-sion in the fore-headâ s mid-dle which in man is La-vaterâ s mark of ge-nius But how Ge-nius in the Sperm Whale Has the Sperm Whale ever writ-ten a book spo-ken a speech No his great ge-nius is de-clared in his do-ing noth-ing par-tic-u-lar to prove it It is more-over de-clared in his pyra-midi-cal si-lence And this re-minds me that had the great Sperm Whale been known to the young Ori-ent World he would have been dei-fied by their child ma-gian thoughts They dei-fied the crocodile of the Nile be-cause the crocodile is tongue-less and the Sperm Whale has no tongue or at least it is so ex-ceed-ing-ly small as to be in-ca-pable of protru-sion If hereafter any high-ly cul-tured poet-i-cal na-tion shall lure back to their birth right the mer-ry May day gods of old and liv-ing-ly en-throne them again in the now ego-tis-ti-cal sky in the now un-haunt-ed hill then be sure ex-alt-ed to Joveâ s high seat the great Sperm Whale shall lord it Cham-pol-lion de-ci-phered the wrin-kled gran-ite hiero-glyph-ics But there is no Cham-pol-lion to de-ci-pher the Egypt of every manâ s and every be-ingâ s face Phys-iog-no-my like every other hu-man science is but a pass-ing fable If then Sir Wil-liam Jones who read in thir-ty lan-guages could not read the sim-plest peas-an-tâ s face in its pro-founder and more sub-tle mean-ings how may un-let-tered Ish-mael hope to read the aw-ful Chaldee of the Sperm Whaleâ s brow I but put that brow be-fore you Read it if you can CHAPTER 8 The Nut If the Sperm Whale be phys-iog-nom-i-cal-ly a Sphinx to the phre-nol-o-gist his brain seems that geo-met-ri-cal cir-cle which it is im-pos-si-ble to square In the full grown crea-ture the skull will mea-sure at least twen-ty feet in length Un-hinge the low-er jaw and the side view of this skull is as the side of a moder-ate-ly in-clined plane rest-ing through-out on a lev-el base But in lifeâ as we have else-where seenâ this in-clined plane is an-gu-lar-ly filled up and al-most squared by the enor-mous su-per-in-cum-bent mass of the junk and sperm At the high end the skull for-ms a crater to bed that part of the mass while un-der the long floor of this craterâ in another cav-i-ty sel-dom ex-ceed-ing ten inch-es in length and as many in depthâ re-pos-es the mere hand-ful of this mon-sterâ s brain The brain is at least twen-ty feet from his ap-par-ent fore-head in life it is hid-den away be-hind its vast out-works like the in-ner-most ci-tadel within the am-pli-fied for-ti-fi-ca-tions of Que-bec So like a choice cas-ket is it se-cret-ed in him that I have known some whale-men who peremp-to-ri-ly de-ny that the Sperm Whale has any other brain than that pal-pa-ble sem-blance of one formed by the cu-bic yards of his sperm magazine Ly-ing in strange folds cours-es and con-vo-lu-tions to their ap-pre-hen-sions it seems more in keep-ing with the idea of his gen-er-al might to re-gard that mys-tic part of him as the seat of his in-tel-li-gence It is plain then that phreno-log-i-cal-ly the head of this Le-viathan in the crea-tureâ s liv-ing in-tact state is an en-tire delu-sion As for his true brain you can then see no indi-ca-tions of it nor feel any The whale like all things that are mighty wears a false brow to the com-mon world If you un-load his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view of its rear end which is the high end you will be struck by its re-sem-blance to the hu-man skull be-held in the same si-t-u-a-tion and from the same point of view In-deed place this re-v-ersed skull scaled down to the hu-man mag-ni-tude among a plate of menâ s skul-ls and you would in-vol-un-tar-i-ly con-found it with them and re-mark-ing the de-pres-sions on one part of its sum-mit in phreno-log-i-cal phrase you would sayâ This man had no self es-teem and no ven-er-a-tion And by those ne-ga-tions con-sid-ered along with the af-fir-ma-tive fact of his prodi-gious bulk and pow-er you can best form to your-self the truest though not the most ex-hil-a-rat-ing con-cep-tion of what the most ex-alt-ed po-ten-cy is But if from the com-par-a-tive di-men-sions of the whaleâ s prop-er brain you deem it in-ca-pable of be-ing ad-e-quate-ly chart-ed then I have another idea for you If you at-ten-tive-ly re-gard al-most any quadrupedâ s spine you will be struck with the re-sem-blance of its ver-te-brÃ to a strung neck-lace of dwarfed skul-ls all bear-ing rudi-men-tal re-sem-blance to the skull prop-er It is a Ger-man con-ceit that the ver-te-brÃ are ab-so-lute-ly un-de-vel-oped skul-ls But the cu-ri-ous ex-ter-nal re-sem-blance I take it the Ger-mans were not the first men to per-ceive A for-eign friend once point-ed it out to me in the skele-ton of a foe he had slain and with the ver-te-brÃ of which he was in-lay-ing in a sort of bas-so relie-vo the beaked prow of his ca-noe Now I con-sid-er that the phre-nol-o-gists have omit-ted an im-por-tant thing in not push-ing their in-ves-ti-ga-tions from the cere-bel-lum through the spinal canal For I believe that much of a manâ s char-ac-ter will be found be-to-kened in his back-bone I would rather feel your spine than your skull who-ev-er you are A thin joist of a spine nev-er yet upheld a full and noble soul I re-joice in my spine as in the firm au-da-cious staff of that flag which I fling half out to the world Ap-ply this spinal branch of phrenol-o-gy to the Sperm Whale His cra-nial cav-i-ty is con-tin-u-ous with the first neck ver-te-bra and in that ver-te-bra the bot-tom of the spinal canal will mea-sure ten inch-es across be-ing eight in height and of a tri-an-gu-lar fig-ure with the base down-wards As it pass-es through the re-main-ing ver-te-brÃ the canal tapers in size but for a con-sid-er-able dis-tance re-mains of large ca-pac-i-ty Now of course this canal is filled with much the same strange-ly fi-brous sub-stanceâ the spinal cordâ as the brain and direct-ly com-mu-ni-cates with the brain And what is still more for many feet after emerg-ing from the brainâ s cav-i-ty the spinal cord re-mains of an un-de-creas-ing girth al-most equal to that of the brain Un-der all th-ese cir-cum-stances would it be un-rea-son-able to sur-vey and map out the whaleâ s spine phreno-log-i-cal-ly For viewed in this light the won-der-ful com-par-a-tive small-ness of his brain prop-er is more than com-pen-sat-ed by the won-der-ful com-par-a-tive mag-ni-tude of his spinal cord But leav-ing this hint to oper-ate as it may with the phre-nol-o-gists I would mere-ly as-sume the spinal the-o-ry for a mo-ment in ref-er-ence to the Sperm Whaleâ s hump This au-gust hump if I mis-take not ris-es over one of the larg-er ver-te-brÃ and is there-fore in some sort the outer con-vex mould of it From its rel-a-tive si-t-u-a-tion then I should call this high hump the or-gan of firm-ness or in-domitable-ness in the Sperm Whale And that the great mon-ster is in-domitable you will yet have rea-son to know CHAPTER 81 The Pe-quod Meets The Vir-gin The pre-des-ti-nat-ed day ar-rived and we du-ly met the ship Jungfrau Der-ick De Deer master of Bre-men At one time the great-est whal-ing peo-ple in the world the Dutch and Ger-mans are now among the least but here and there at very wide in-ter-vals of lat-i-tude and lon-gi-tude you still oc-ca-sion-al-ly meet with their flag in the Pa-cif-ic For some rea-son the Jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her re-spec-ts While yet some dis-tance from the Pe-quod she round-ed to and drop-ping a boat her cap-tain was im-pelled towards us im-pa-tient-ly stand-ing in the bows in-stead of the stern â What has he in his hand there â cried Star-buck point-ing to some-thing wav-ing-ly held by the Ger-man â Im-pos-si-ble â a lamp feed-er â â Not that â said Stubb â no no itâ s a cof-fee pot Mr Star-buck heâ s com-ing off to make us our cof-fee is the Yar-man donâ t you see that big tin can there along-side of him â thatâ s his boil-ing water Oh heâ s all right is the Yar-man â â Go along with you â cried Flask â itâ s a lamp feed-er and an oil can Heâ s out of oil and has come a beg-ging â How-ev-er cu-ri-ous it may seem for an oil ship to be bor-row-ing oil on the whale ground and how-ev-er much it may in-vert-ed-ly con-tra-dict the old proverb about car-ry-ing coals to New-cas-tle yet some-times such a thing real-ly hap-pens and in the pre-sent case Cap-tain Der-ick De Deer did in-du-bitably con-duct a lamp feed-er as Flask did de-clare As he mount-ed the deck Ahab abrupt-ly ac-cost-ed him without at all heed-ing what he had in his hand but in his bro-ken lin-go the Ger-man soon evinced his com-plete ig-no-rance of the White Whale im-me-di-ate-ly turn-ing the con-ver-sa-tion to his lamp feed-er and oil can with some re-marks touch-ing his hav-ing to turn in-to his ham-mock at night in pro-found dark-nessâ his last drop of Bre-men oil be-ing gone and not a sin-gle fly-ing fish yet cap-tured to sup-ply the de-fi-cien-cy con-clud-ing by hint-ing that his ship was in-deed what in the Fish-ery is tech-ni-cal-ly called a clean one that is an emp-ty one well de-serv-ing the name of Jungfrau or the Vir-gin His ne-ces-si-ties sup-plied Der-ick depart-ed but he had not gained his shipâ s side when whales were al-most si-mul-ta-ne-ous-ly raised from the mast heads of both ves-sels and so eager for the chase was Der-ick that without paus-ing to put his oil can and lamp feed-er aboard he slewed round his boat and made after the le-viathan lamp feed-ers Now the game hav-ing risen to lee-ward he and the other three Ger-man boats that soon fol-lowed him had con-sid-er-ably the start of the Pe-quodâ s keels There were eight whales an aver-age pod Aware of their danger they were go-ing all abreast with great speed straight be-fore the wind rub-bing their flanks as close-ly as so many spans of hors-es in har-ness They left a great wide wake as though con-tin-u-al-ly un-rolling a great wide parch-ment upon the sea Full in this rapid wake and many fath-oms in the rear swam a huge humped old bull which by his com-par-a-tive-ly slow progress as well as by the unusu-al yel-low-ish in-crus-ta-tions over-grow-ing him seemed af-flict-ed with the jaun-dice or some other in-fir-mi-ty Whether this whale be-longed to the pod in ad-vance seemed ques-tion-able for it is not cus-tom-ary for such ven-er-a-ble le-viathans to be at all so-cial Nev-er-the-less he stuck to their wake though in-deed their back water must have re-tard-ed him be-cause the white bone or swell at his broad muz-zle was a dashed one like the swell formed when two hos-tile cur-ren-ts meet His spout was short slow and la-bo-ri-ous com-ing forth with a chok-ing sort of gush and spend-ing it-self in torn shreds fol-lowed by strange subter-ranean com-mo-tions in him which seemed to have egress at his other buried ex-trem-i-ty caus-ing the waters be-hind him to up-bub-ble â Whoâ s got some pare-goric â said Stubb â he has the stomach ache Iâ m afraid Lord think of hav-ing half an acre of stomach ache Ad-verse winds are hold-ing mad Christ-mas in him boys Itâ s the first foul wind I ever knew to blow from astern but look did ever whale yaw so be-fore it must be heâ s lost his tiller â As an over-laden In-dia-man bear-ing down the Hin-dostan coast with a deck load of fright-ened hors-es ca-reens buries rol-ls and wal-lows on her way so did this old whale heave his aged bulk and now and then part-ly turn-ing over on his cum-brous rib ends ex-pose the cause of his de-vi-ous wake in the un-nat-u-ral stump of his star-board fin Whether he had lost that fin in bat-tle or had been born without it it were hard to say â On-ly wait a bit old chap and Iâ ll give ye a sling for that wound-ed arm â cried cru-el Flask point-ing to the whale line near him â Mind he donâ t sling thee with it â cried Star-buck â Give way or the Ger-man will have him â With one in-tent all the com-bined ri-val boats were point-ed for this one fish be-cause not on-ly was he the largest and there-fore the most valu-able whale but he was near-est to them and the other whales were go-ing with such great ve-loc-i-ty more-over as al-most to de-fy pur-suit for the time At this junc-ture the Pe-quodâ s keels had shot by the three Ger-man boats last low-ered but from the great start he had had Der-ickâ s boat still led the chase though every mo-ment neared by his for-eign ri-vals The on-ly thing they feared was that from be-ing al-ready so nigh to his mark he would be en-abled to dart his iron be-fore they could com-plete-ly over-take and pass him As for Der-ick he seemed quite con-fi-dent that this would be the case and oc-ca-sion-al-ly with a derid-ing ges-ture shook his lamp feed-er at the other boats â The un-gra-cious and un-grate-ful dog â cried Star-buck â he mocks and dares me with the very poor box I filled for him not five min-utes ago â â then in his old in-tense whis-perâ â Give way grey-hounds Dog to it â â I tell ye what it is menâ â cried Stubb to his crewâ â itâ s against my reli-gion to get mad but Iâ d like to eat that vil-lain-ous Yar-manâ Pul-lâ wonâ t ye Are ye go-ing to let that ras-cal beat ye Do ye love brandy A hogshead of brandy then to the best man Come why donâ t some of ye burst a blood ves-sel Whoâ s that been drop-ping an an-chor over-boardâ we donâ t budge

will ye spit fire or not â â Oh see the suds he makes â cried Flask danc-ing up and downâ â What a humpâ Oh do pile on the beefâ lays like a log Oh my lads do springâ slap jacks and qua-hogs for

such a sog such a sog-ger Donâ t ye love sperm There goes three thou-sand dol-lars men â a bank â a whole bank The bank of Eng-land â Oh do do do â Whatâ s that Yar-man about now â At this mo-ment Der-ick was in the act of pitch-ing his lamp feed-er at the ad-vanc-ing boats and al-so his oil can per-haps with the dou-ble view of re-tard-ing his ri-val-sâ way and at the same time eco-nom-i-cal-ly ac-cel-er-at-ing his own by the mo-men-tary im-pe-tus of the back-ward toss â The un-man-ner-ly Dutch dog-ger â cried Stubb â Pull now men like fifty thou-sand line of bat-tle ship loads of red haired devils What dâ ye say Tashtego are you the man to snap your spine in two and twen-ty pieces for the honor of old Gay-head What dâ ye say â â I say pull like god dam â â cried the In-di-an Fierce-ly but even-ly incit-ed by the taun-ts of the Ger-man the Pe-quodâ s three boats now be-gan rang-ing al-most abreast and so dis-posed mo-men-tar-i-ly neared him In that fine loose chival-rous at-ti-tude of the heads-man when draw-ing near to his prey the three mates stood up proud-ly oc-ca-sion-al-ly back-ing the after oars-man with an ex-hil-a-rat-ing cry of â There she slides now Hur-rah for the white ash breeze Down with the Yar-man Sail over him â But so de-cid-ed an orig-i-nal start had Der-ick had that spite of all their gal-lantry he would have proved the vic-tor in this race had not a righ-teous judg-ment descend-ed upon him in a crab which caught the blade of his mid-ship oars-man While this clum-sy lub-ber was striv-ing to free his white ash and while in con-se-quence Der-ickâ s boat was nigh to cap-siz-ing and he thun-der-ing away at his men in a mighty rage â that was a good time for Star-buck Stubb and Flask With a shout they took a mor-tal start for-wards and slant-ing-ly ranged up on the Ger-manâ s quar-ter An in-stant more and all four boats were di-ag-o-ni-cal-ly in the whaleâ s im-me-di-ate wake while stretch-ing from them on both sides was the foam-ing swell that he made It was a ter-rif-ic most pi-tiable and mad-den-ing sight The whale was now go-ing head out and send-ing his spout be-fore him in a con-tin-u-al tor-ment-ed jet while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of fright Now to this hand now to that he yawed in his fal-ter-ing flight and still at every bil-low that he broke he spas-mod-i-cal-ly sank in the sea or side-ways rolled towards the sky his one beat-ing fin So have I seen a bird with clipped wing mak-ing af-fright-ed bro-ken cir-cles in the air vain-ly striv-ing to es-cape the pi-rat-i-cal hawks But the bird has a voice and with plain-tive cries will make known her fear but the fear of this vast dumb brute of the sea was chained up and en-chant-ed in him he had no voice save that chok-ing re-s-pi-ra-tion through his spir-a-cle and this made the sight of him un-speak-ably pi-tiable while still in his amaz-ing bulk portcullis jaw and om-nipo-tent tail there was enough to ap-pal the stoutest man who so pi-tied See-ing now that but a very few mo-men-ts more would give the Pe-quodâ s boats the ad-van-tage and rather than be thus foiled of his game Der-ick chose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusu-al-ly long dart ere the last chance would for ever es-cape But no soon-er did his har-pooneer stand up for the stroke than all three tiger-sâ Quee-queg Tashtego Dag-gooâ in-stinc-tive-ly sprang to their feet and stand-ing in a di-ag-o-nal row si-mul-ta-ne-ous-ly point-ed their bar-bs and dart-ed over the head of the Ger-man har-pooneer their three Nan-tuck-et irons en-tered the whale Blind-ing va-pors of foam and white fire The three boats in the first fury of the whaleâ s head-long rush bumped the Ger-manâ s aside with such force that both Der-ick and his baf-fled har-pooneer were spilled out and sailed over by the three fly-ing keels â Donâ t be afraid my but-ter box-es â cried Stubb cast-ing a pass-ing glance upon them as he shot by â yeâ ll be picked up present-lyâ all rightâ I saw some sharks asternâ St Bernardâ s dogs you knowâ relieve distressed trav-ellers Hur-rah this is the way to sail now Every keel a sun-beam Hur-rah â Here we go like three tin ket-tles at the tail of a mad cougar This puts me in mind of fas-ten-ing to an ele-phant in a til-bury on a plainâ makes the wheel spokes fly boys when you fas-ten to him that way and thereâ s danger of be-ing pitched out too when you strike a hill Hur-rah this is the way a fel-low feels when heâ s go-ing to Davy Jonesâ all a rush down an end-less in-clined plane Hur-rah this whale car-ries the ever-last-ing mail â But the mon-sterâ s run was a brief one Giv-ing a sud-den gasp he tu-mul-tuous-ly sound-ed With a grat-ing rush the three lines flew round the log-ger-heads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them while so fear-ful were the har-pooneers that this rapid sound-ing would soon ex-haust the lines that us-ing all their dex-ter-ous might they caught re-peat-ed smok-ing turns with the rope to hold on till at lastâ owing to the per-pen-dic-u-lar strain from the lead lined chocks of the boats whence the three ropes went straight down in-to the blueâ the gun-wales of the bows were al-most even with the water while the three sterns tilt-ed high in the air And the whale soon ceas-ing to sound for some time they re-mained in that at-ti-tude fear-ful of ex-pend-ing more line though the po-si-tion was a lit-tle tick-lish But though boats have been tak-en down and lost in this way yet it is this â hold-ing on â as it is called this hook-ing up by the sharp bar-bs of his live flesh from the back this it is that often tor-men-ts the Le-viathan in-to soon ris-ing again to meet the sharp lance of his foes Yet not to speak of the per-il of the thing it is to be doubt-ed whether this course is al-ways the best for it is but rea-son-able to pre-sume that the longer the strick-en whale stays un-der water the more he is ex-haust-ed Be-cause owing to the enor-mous sur-face of himâ in a full grown sperm whale some-thing less than 2 square feetâ the pres-sure of the water is im-mense We all know what an as-ton-ish-ing at-mo-spher-ic weight we our-selves stand up un-der even here above ground in the air how vast then the bur-den of a whale bear-ing on his back a col-umn of two hun-dred fath-oms of ocean It must at least equal the weight of fifty at-mo-spheres One whale-man has es-ti-mat-ed it at the weight of twen-ty line of bat-tle ships with all their guns and stores and men on board As the three boats lay there on that gent-ly rolling sea gaz-ing down in-to its eter-nal blue noon and as not a sin-gle groan or cry of any sort nay not so much as a rip-ple or a bub-ble came up from its depths what lands-man would have thought that be-neath all that si-lence and placid-i-ty the ut-most mon-ster of the seas was writhing and wrench-ing in agony Not eight inch-es of per-pen-dic-u-lar rope were vis-i-ble at the bows Seems it cred-i-ble that by three such thin threads the great Le-viathan was sus-pend-ed like the big weight to an eight day clock Sus-pend-ed and to what To three bits of board Is this the crea-ture of whom it was once so tri-umphant-ly saidâ â Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons or his head with fish spears The sword of him that layeth at him can-not hold the spear the dart nor the haber-geon he es-teemeth iron as straw the ar-row can-not make him flee darts are count-ed as stub-ble he laugh-eth at the shak-ing of a spear â This the crea-ture this he Oh that un-ful-fil-men-ts should fol-low the prophets For with the strength of a thou-sand thighs in his tail Le-viathan had run his head un-der the moun-tains of the sea to hide him from the Pe-quodâ s fish spears In that slop-ing after-noon sun-light the shad-ows that the three boats sent down be-neath the sur-face must have been long enough and broad enough to shade half Xerx-esâ army Who can tell how ap-palling to the wound-ed whale must have been such huge phan-toms flit-ting over his head â Stand by men he stirs â cried Star-buck as the three lines sud-den-ly vi-brat-ed in the water distinct-ly con-duct-ing up-wards to them as by mag-net-ic wires the life and death throbs of the whale so that every oars-man felt them in his seat The next mo-ment relieved in great part from the down-ward strain at the bows the boats gave a sud-den bounce up-wards as a small ice-field will when a dense herd of white bears are scared from it in-to the sea â Haul in Haul in â cried Star-buck again â heâ s ris-ing â The lines of which hard-ly an in-stant be-fore not one handâ s breadth could have been gained were now in long quick coils flung back all drip-ping in-to the boats and soon the whale broke water within two shipâ s lengths of the hun-ters His mo-tions plain-ly denot-ed his ex-treme ex-haus-tion In most land an-i-mals there are cer-tain valves or flood gates in many of their veins where-by when wound-ed the blood is in some de-gree at least in-stant-ly shut off in cer-tain direc-tions Not so with the whale one of whose pe-cu-liar-i-ties it is to have an en-tire non valvu-lar struc-ture of the blood ves-sels so that when pierced even by so small a point as a har-poon a dead-ly drain is at once be-gun upon his whole ar-te-ri-al sys-tem and when this is height-ened by the ex-traor-di-nary pres-sure of water at a great dis-tance below the sur-face his life may be said to pour from him in inces-sant streams Yet so vast is the quan-ti-ty of blood in him and so dis-tant and numer-ous its in-te-ri-or foun-tains that he will keep thus bleed-ing and bleed-ing for a con-sid-er-able pe-ri-od even as in a drought a riv-er will flow whose source is in the well springs of far off and undis-cernible hil-ls Even now when the boats pulled upon this whale and per-ilous-ly drew over his sway-ing flukes and the lances were dart-ed in-to him they were fol-lowed by steady jets from the new made wound which kept con-tin-u-al-ly play-ing while the nat-u-ral spout hole in his head was on-ly at in-ter-vals how-ev-er rapid send-ing its af-fright-ed mois-ture in-to the air From this last vent no blood yet came be-cause no vi-tal part of him had thus far been struck His life as they sig-nif-i-cant-ly call it was un-touched As the boats now more close-ly sur-round-ed him the whole up-per part of his form with much of it that is or-di-nar-i-ly sub-merged was plain-ly re-vealed His eyes or rather the places where his eyes had been were be-held As strange mis-grown mass-es gather in the knot holes of the noblest oaks when pros-trate so from the poin-ts which the whaleâ s eyes had once oc-cu-pied now protrud-ed blind bul-bs hor-ri-bly pi-tiable to see But pi-ty there was none For all his old age and his one arm and his blind eyes he must die the death and be mur-dered in order to light the gay bri-dals and other mer-ry mak-ings of men and al-so to il-lu-mi-nate the solemn church-es that preach un-con-di-tion-al inof-fen-sive-ness by all to all Still rolling in his blood at last he par-tial-ly dis-closed a strange-ly dis-coloured bunch or pro-tu-ber-ance the size of a bushel low down on the flank â A nice spot â cried Flask â just let me prick him there once â â Avast â cried Star-buck â thereâ s no need of that â But hu-mane Star-buck was too late At the in-stant of the dart an ul-cer-ous jet shot from this cru-el wound and goad-ed by it in-to more than suf-fer-able an-guish the whale now spout-ing thick blood with swift fury blind-ly dart-ed at the craft bes-pat-ter-ing them and their glo-ry-ing crews all over with show-ers of gore cap-siz-ing Flaskâ s boat and mar-ring the bows It was his death stroke For by this time so spent was he by loss of blood that he help-less-ly rolled away from the wreck he had made lay pant-ing on his side im-po-tent-ly flapped with his stumped fin then over and over slow-ly re-volved like a wan-ing world turned up the white se-crets of his bel-ly lay like a log and died It was most pi-teous that last ex-pir-ing spout As when by unseen hands the water is grad-u-al-ly drawn off from some mighty foun-tain and with half sti-fled me-lan-choly gur-glings the spray col-umn low-ers and low-ers to the groundâ so the last long dy-ing spout of the whale Soon while the crews were await-ing the ar-rival of the ship the body showed symp-toms of sink-ing with all its trea-sures un-ri-fled Im-me-di-ate-ly by Star-buckâ s orders lines were se-cured to it at dif-fer-ent poin-ts so that ere long every boat was a buoy the sunken whale be-ing sus-pend-ed a few inch-es be-neath them by the cords By very heed-ful man-age-ment when the ship drew nigh the whale was trans-ferred to her side and was strong-ly se-cured there by the stiffest fluke chains for it was plain that un-less ar-ti-fi-cial-ly upheld the body would at once sink to the bot-tom It so chanced that al-most upon first cut-ting in-to him with the spade the en-tire length of a cor-rod-ed har-poon was found imbed-ded in his flesh on the low-er part of the bunch be-fore de-scribed But as the stumps of har-poons are fre-quent-ly found in the dead bodies of cap-tured whales with the flesh per-fect-ly healed around them and no promi-nence of any kind to denote their place there-fore there must needs have been some other un-known rea-son in the pre-sent case ful-ly to ac-count for the ul-cer-a-tion al-lud-ed to But still more cu-ri-ous was the fact of a lance head of stone be-ing found in him not far from the buried iron the flesh per-fect-ly firm about it Who had dart-ed that stone lance And when It might have been dart-ed by some Norâ West In-di-an long be-fore Amer-i-ca was dis-cov-ered What other marvels might have been rum-maged out of this mon-strous cabi-net there is no telling But a sud-den stop was put to fur-ther dis-cov-er-ies by the shipâ s be-ing un-prece-dent-ed-ly dragged over side-ways to the sea owing to the bodyâ s im-mense-ly in-creas-ing ten-den-cy to sink How-ev-er Star-buck who had the order-ing of af-fairs hung on to it to the last hung on to it so res-o-lute-ly in-deed that when at length the ship would have been cap-sized if still per-sist-ing in lock-ing ar-ms with the body then when the com-mand was giv-en to break clear from it such was the im-mov-able strain upon the tim-ber heads to which the fluke chains and cables were fas-tened that it was im-pos-si-ble to cast them off Mean-time every-thing in the Pe-quod was as-lant To cross to the other side of the deck was like walk-ing up the steep gabled roof of a house The ship groaned and gasped Many of the ivory in-lay-ings of her bul-warks and cabins were start-ed from their places by the un-nat-u-ral dis-lo-ca-tion In vain hand-spikes and crows were brought to bear upon the im-mov-able fluke chains to pry them adrift from the tim-ber-heads and so low had the whale now set-tled that the sub-merged ends could not be at all ap-proached while every mo-ment whole tons of pon-deros-i-ty seemed added to the sink-ing bulk and the ship seemed on the point of go-ing over â Hold on hold on wonâ t ye â cried Stubb to the body â donâ t be in such a devil of a hur-ry to sink By thun-der men we must do some-thing or go for it No use pry-ing there avast I say with your hand-spikes and run one of ye for a pray-er book and a pen knife and cut the big chains â â Knife Aye aye â cried Quee-queg and seiz-ing the car-pen-terâ s heavy hatch-et he leaned out of a port-hole and steel to iron be-gan slash-ing at the largest fluke chains But a few strokes full of sparks were giv-en when the ex-ceed-ing strain ef-fect-ed the rest With a ter-rif-ic snap every fas-ten-ing went adrift the ship right-ed the car-case sank Now this oc-ca-sion-al inevitable sink-ing of the re-cent-ly killed Sperm Whale is a very cu-ri-ous thing nor has any fish-er-man yet ad-e-quate-ly ac-count-ed for it Usu-al-ly the dead Sperm Whale floats with great buoy-an-cy with its side or bel-ly con-sid-er-ably el-e-vat-ed above the sur-face If the on-ly whales that thus sank were old mea-gre and bro-ken heart-ed crea-tures their pads of lard di-min-ished and all their bones heavy and rheumat-ic then you might with some rea-son assert that this sink-ing is caused by an un-com-mon spe-cif-ic grav-i-ty in the fish so sink-ing con-se-quent upon this ab-sence of buoy-ant mat-ter in him But it is not so For young whales in the high-est health and swelling with noble aspi-ra-tions pre-ma-ture-ly cut off in the warm flush and May of life with all their pant-ing lard about them even th-ese brawny buoy-ant heroes do some-times sink Be it said how-ev-er that the Sperm Whale is far less li-able to this ac-ci-dent than any other species Where one of that sort go down twen-ty Right Whales do This dif-fer-ence in the species is no doubt im-putable in no small de-gree to the greater quan-ti-ty of bone in the Right Whale his Vene-tian blinds alone some-times weigh-ing more than a ton from this in-cum-brance the Sperm Whale is whol-ly free But there are in-stances where after the lapse of many hours or sev-er-al days the sunken whale again ris-es more buoy-ant than in life But the rea-son of this is ob-vi-ous Gas-es are gen-er-at-ed in him he swells to a prodi-gious mag-ni-tude be-comes a sort of an-i-mal bal-loon A line of bat-tle ship could hard-ly keep him un-der then In the Shore Whal-ing on sound-ings among the Bays of New Zealand when a Right Whale gives to-ken of sink-ing they fas-ten buoys to him with plen-ty of rope so that when the body has gone down they know where to look for it when it shall have as-cend-ed again It was not long after the sink-ing of the body that a cry was heard from the Pe-quodâ s mast heads an-nounc-ing that the Jungfrau was again low-er-ing her boats though the on-ly spout in sight was that of a Fin Back be-long-ing to the species of un-cap-turable whales be-cause of its in-cred-i-ble pow-er of swim-ming Nev-er-the-less the Fin Backâ s spout is so sim-i-lar to the Sperm Whaleâ s that by un-skil-ful fish-er-men it is often mis-tak-en for it And con-se-quent-ly Der-ick and all his host were now in valiant chase of this un-n-ear-able brute The Vir-gin crowd-ing all sail made after her four young keels and thus they all dis-ap-peared far to lee-ward still in bold hope-ful chase Oh many are the Fin Backs and many are the Der-icks my friend CHAPTER 82 The Honor and Glo-ry of Whal-ing There are some en-ter-pris-es in which a care-ful disor-der-li-ness is the true method The more I dive in-to this mat-ter of whal-ing and push my re-search-es up to the very spring head of it so much the more am I im-pressed with its great honor-able-ness and an-tiq-ui-ty and espe-cial-ly when I find so many great de-mi gods and heroes prophets of all sorts who one way or other have shed distinc-tion upon it I am trans-port-ed with the re-flec-tion that I my-self be-long though but subor-di-nate-ly to so em-bla-zoned a fra-ter-ni-ty The gal-lant Perseus a son of Jupiter was the first whale-man and to the eter-nal honor of our calling be it said that the first whale at-tacked by our brother-hood was not killed with any sor-did in-tent Those were the knight-ly days of our pro-fes-sion when we on-ly bore ar-ms to suc-cor the distressed and not to fill menâ s lamp feed-ers Every one knows the fine sto-ry of Perseus and An-drome-da how the love-ly An-drome-da the daugh-ter of a king was tied to a rock on the sea coast and as Le-viathan was in the very act of car-ry-ing her off Perseus the prince of whale-men in-trepid-ly ad-vanc-ing har-pooned the mon-ster and de-liv-ered and mar-ried the maid It was an ad-mirable artis-tic ex-ploit rare-ly achieved by the best har-pooneers of the pre-sent day inas-much as this Le-viathan was slain at the very first dart And let no man doubt this Arkite sto-ry for in the an-cient Jop-pa now Jaf-fa on the Syr-i-an coast in one of the Pa-gan tem-ples there stood for many ages the vast skele-ton of a whale which the ci-tyâ s le-gends and all the in-hab-i-tan-ts assert-ed to be the iden-ti-cal bones of the mon-ster that Perseus slew When the Ro-mans took Jop-pa the same skele-ton was car-ried to Italy in tri-umph What seems most sin-gu-lar and sugges-tive-ly im-por-tant in this sto-ry is this it was from Jop-pa that Jon-ah set sail Akin to the ad-ven-ture of Perseus and An-dromedaâ in-deed by some sup-posed to be indi-rect-ly derived from itâ is that fa-mous sto-ry of St Ge-orge and the Dragon which dragon I main-tain to have been a whale for in many old chron-i-cles whales and dragons are strange-ly jum-bled to-geth-er and often stand for each other â Thou art as a lion of the waters and as a dragon of the sea â saith Ezekiel here-by plain-ly mean-ing a whale in truth some ver-sions of the Bi-ble use that word it-self Be-sides it would much sub-tract from the glo-ry of the ex-ploit had St Ge-orge but en-coun-tered a crawl-ing rep-tile of the land in-stead of do-ing bat-tle with the great mon-ster of the deep Any man may kill a snake but on-ly a Perseus a St Ge-orge a Cof-fin have the heart in them to march bold-ly up to a whale Let not the modern paint-ings of this scene mislead us for though the crea-ture en-coun-tered by that valiant whale-man of old is vague-ly rep-re-sent-ed of a grif-fin like shape and though the bat-tle is depict-ed on land and the saint on horse-back yet con-sid-er-ing the great ig-no-rance of those times when the true form of the whale was un-known to artists and con-sid-er-ing that as in Perseusâ case St Ge-orgeâ s whale might have crawled up out of the sea on the beach and con-sid-er-ing that the an-i-mal rid-den by St Ge-orge might have been on-ly a large seal or sea horse bear-ing all this in mind it will not ap-pear al-to-geth-er in-com-pat-i-ble with the sa-cred le-gend and the an-cien-test draugh-ts of the scene to hold this so called dragon no other than the great Le-viathan him-self In fact placed be-fore the strict and pierc-ing truth this whole sto-ry will fare like that fish flesh and fowl idol of the Philistines Dagon by name who be-ing plant-ed be-fore the ark of Is-rael his horseâ s head and both the palms of his hands fell off from him and on-ly the stump or fishy part of him re-mained Thus then one of our own noble stamp even a whale-man is the tute-lary guardian of Eng-land and by good rights we har-pooneers of Nan-tuck-et should be en-rolled in the most noble order of St Ge-orge And there-fore let not the knights of that honor-able com-pa-ny none of whom I ven-ture to say have ever had to do with a whale like their great pa-tron let them nev-er eye a Nan-tuck-eter with dis-dain since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we are much bet-ter en-ti-tled to St Ge-orgeâ s dec-o-ra-tion than they Whether to ad-mit Her-cules among us or not con-cern-ing this I long re-mained du-bi-ous for though ac-cord-ing to the Greek mytholo-gies that an-tique Crock-ett and Kit Car-sonâ that brawny do-er of re-joic-ing good deeds was swal-lowed down and thrown up by a whale still whether that strict-ly makes a whale-man of him that might be moot-ed It nowhere ap-pears that he ever ac-tu-al-ly har-pooned his fish un-less in-deed from the in-side Nev-er-the-less he may be deemed a sort of in-vol-un-tary whale-man at any rate the whale caught him if he did not the whale I claim him for one of our clan But by the best con-tra-dic-to-ry author-i-ties this Gre-cian sto-ry of Her-cules and the whale is con-sid-ered to be derived from the still more an-cient He-brew sto-ry of Jon-ah and the whale and vice ver-sÃ cer-tain-ly they are very sim-i-lar If I claim the de-mi god then why not the prophet Nor do heroes sain-ts demigods and prophets alone com-prise the whole roll of our order Our grand master is still to be named for like roy-al kings of old times we find the head waters of our fra-ter-ni-ty in noth-ing short of the great gods them-selves That won-drous ori-en-tal sto-ry is now to be re-hearsed from the Shaster which gives us the dread Vish-noo one of the three per-sons in the god-head of the Hin-doos gives us this divine Vish-noo him-self for our Lord â Vish-noo who by the first of his ten earth-ly in-car-na-tions has for ever set apart and sanc-ti-fied the whale When Brah-ma or the God of Gods saith the Shaster re-solved to re-cre-ate the world after one of its pe-ri-od-i-cal dis-so-lu-tions he gave birth to Vish-noo to pre-side over the work but the Vedas or mys-ti-cal books whose perusal would seem to have been indis-pens-able to Vish-noo be-fore begin-ning the creation and which there-fore must have con-tained some-thing in the shape of prac-ti-cal hin-ts to young ar-chi-tec-ts th-ese Vedas were ly-ing at the bot-tom of the waters so Vish-noo be-came in-car-nate in a whale and sound-ing down in him to the ut-ter-most depths res-cued the sa-cred vol-umes Was not this Vish-noo a whale-man then even as a man who rides a horse is called a horse-man Perseus St Ge-orge Her-cules Jon-ah and Vish-noo thereâ s a mem-ber roll for you What club but the whale-manâ s can head off like that CHAPTER 83 Jon-ah His-tor-i-cal-ly Re-gard-ed Ref-er-ence was made to the his-tor-i-cal sto-ry of Jon-ah and the whale in the pre-ced-ing chap-ter Now some Nan-tuck-eters rather distrust this his-tor-i-cal sto-ry of Jon-ah and the whale But then there were some scep-ti-cal Greeks and Ro-mans who stand-ing out from the ortho-dox pa-gans of their times equal-ly doubt-ed the sto-ry of Her-cules and the whale and Ari-on and the dol-phin and yet their doubt-ing those tra-di-tions did not make those tra-di-tions one whit the less fac-ts for all that One old Sag Har-bor whale-manâ s chief rea-son for ques-tion-ing the He-brew sto-ry was this â He had one of those quaint old fash-ioned Bi-bles em-bel-lished with cu-ri-ous un-sci-en-tif-ic plates one of which rep-re-sent-ed Jon-ahâ s whale with two spouts in his headâ a pe-cu-liar-i-ty on-ly true with re-spect to a species of the Le-viathan the Right Whale and the va-ri-eties of that order con-cern-ing which the fish-er-men have this say-ing â A pen-ny roll would choke himâ his swal-low is so very small But to this Bish-op Jeb-bâ s an-tic-i-pa-tive an-swer is ready It is not ne-c-es-sary hin-ts the Bish-op that we con-sid-er Jon-ah as tombed in the whaleâ s bel-ly but as tem-porar-i-ly lodged in some part of his mouth And this seems rea-son-able enough in the good Bish-op For tru-ly the Right Whaleâ s mouth would ac-com-mo-date a cou-ple of whist tables and com-fort-ably seat all the play-ers Pos-si-bly too Jon-ah might have en-sconced him-self in a hol-low tooth but on se-cond thoughts the Right Whale is tooth-less Another rea-son which Sag Har-bor he went by that name urged for his want of faith in this mat-ter of the prophet was some-thing ob-scure-ly in ref-er-ence to his in-car-cer-at-ed body and the whaleâ s gas-tric juices But this ob-jec-tion like-wise fal-ls to the ground be-cause a Ger-man ex-egetist sup-pos-es that Jon-ah must have tak-en refuge in the float-ing body of a dead whaleâ even as the French soldiers in the Rus-sian cam-paign turned their dead hors-es in-to ten-ts and crawled in-to them Be-sides it has been divined by other con-ti-nen-tal com-men-ta-tors that when Jon-ah was thrown over-board from the Jop-pa ship he straight-way ef-fect-ed his es-cape to another ves-sel near by some ves-sel with a whale for a fig-ure head and I would add pos-si-bly called â The Whale â as some craft are nowa-days chris-tened the â Shark â the â Gull â the â Ea-gle â Nor have there been want-ing learned ex-egetists who have opined that the whale men-tioned in the book of Jon-ah mere-ly meant a life pre-serverâ an in-flat-ed bag of windâ which the en-dan-gered prophet swam to and so was saved from a watery doom Poor Sag Har-bor there-fore seems worsted all round But he had still another rea-son for his want of faith It was this if I re-mem-ber right Jon-ah was swal-lowed by the whale in the Mediter-ranean Sea and after three days he was vomit-ed up some-where within three daysâ jour-ney of Nin-eveh a ci-ty on the Ti-gris very much more than three daysâ jour-ney across from the near-est point of the Mediter-ranean coast How is that But was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that short dis-tance of Nin-eveh Yes He might have car-ried him round by the way of the Cape of Good Hope But not to speak of the pas-sage through the whole length of the Mediter-ranean and another pas-sage up the Per-sian Gulf and Red Sea such a sup-po-si-tion would in-volve the com-plete cir-cum-nav-i-ga-tion of all Africa in three days not to speak of the Ti-gris waters near the site of Nin-eveh be-ing too shal-low for any whale to swim in Be-sides this idea of Jon-ahâ s weather-ing the Cape of Good Hope at so ear-ly a day would wrest the honor of the dis-cov-ery of that great head-land from Bartholomew Di-az its re-put-ed dis-cov-erer and so make modern his-to-ry a liar But all th-ese fool-ish ar-gu-men-ts of old Sag Har-bor on-ly evinced his fool-ish pride of rea-sonâ a thing still more rep-re-hen-si-ble in him see-ing that he had but lit-tle learn-ing ex-cept what he had picked up from the sun and the sea I say it on-ly shows his fool-ish im-pi-ous pride and abom-inable devil-ish re-bel-lion against the rev-erend cler-gy For by a Por-tuguese Catholic pri-est this very idea of Jon-ahâ s go-ing to Nin-eveh via the Cape of Good Hope was ad-vanced as a sig-nal mag-ni-fi-ca-tion of the gen-er-al mir-a-cle And so it was Be-sides to this day the high-ly en-light-ened Turks devout-ly believe in the his-tor-i-cal sto-ry of Jon-ah And some three cen-turies ago an English trav-eller in old Har-risâ s Voy-ages speaks of a Turk-ish Mosque built in honor of Jon-ah in which Mosque was a mirac-u-lous lamp that burnt without any oil CHAPTER 84 Pitch-pol-ing To make them run easi-ly and swift-ly the axles of car-riages are anoint-ed and for much the same pur-pose some whalers per-form an anal-o-gous oper-a-tion upon their boat they grease the bot-tom Nor is it to be doubt-ed that as such a pro-ce-dure can do no harm it may pos-si-bly be of no con-temptible ad-van-tage con-sid-er-ing that oil and water are hos-tile that oil is a slid-ing thing and that the ob-ject in view is to make the boat slide brave-ly Quee-queg believed strong-ly in anoint-ing his boat and one morn-ing not long after the Ger-man ship Jungfrau dis-ap-peared took more than cus-tom-ary pains in that oc-cu-pa-tion crawl-ing un-der its bot-tom where it hung over the side and rub-bing in the unc-tu-ous-ness as though dili-gent-ly seek-ing to in-sure a crop of hair from the craftâ s bald keel He seemed to be work-ing in obe-di-ence to some par-tic-u-lar pre-sen-ti-ment Nor did it re-main un-war-rant-ed by the event Towards noon whales were raised but so soon as the ship sailed down to them they turned and fled with swift pre-cip-i-tan-cy a disor-dered flight as of Cleopa-traâ s barges from Ac-tium Nev-er-the-less the boats pur-sued and Stub-bâ s was fore-most By great ex-er-tion Tashtego at last suc-ceed-ed in plant-ing one iron but the strick-en whale without at all sound-ing still con-tin-ued his hor-i-zon-tal flight with added fleet-ness Such un-in-ter-mit-ted strain-ings upon the plant-ed iron must soon-er or later inevitably ex-tract it It be-came im-per-a-tive to lance the fly-ing whale or be con-tent to lose him But to haul the boat up to his flank was im-pos-si-ble he swam so fast and fu-ri-ous What then re-mained Of all the won-drous de-vices and dex-ter-i-ties the sleights of hand and count-less subtleties to which the veter-an whale-man is so often forced none ex-ceed that fine manÅ uvre with the lance called pitch-pol-ing Small sword or broad sword in all its ex-er-cis-es boasts noth-ing like it It is on-ly indis-pens-able with an in-vet-er-ate run-ning whale its grand fact and fea-ture is the won-der-ful dis-tance to which the long lance is ac-cu-rate-ly dart-ed from a vi-o-lent-ly rock-ing jerk-ing boat un-der ex-treme head-way Steel and wood in-clud-ed the en-tire spear is some ten or twelve feet in length the staff is much slighter than that of the har-poon and al-so of a lighter ma-te-ri-alâ pine It is fur-nished with a small rope called a warp of con-sid-er-able length by which it can be hauled back to the hand after dart-ing But be-fore go-ing fur-ther it is im-por-tant to men-tion here that though the har-poon may be pitch-poled in the same way with the lance yet it is sel-dom done and when done is still less fre-quent-ly suc-cess-ful on ac-count of the greater weight and in-fe-ri-or length of the har-poon as com-pared with the lance which in ef-fect be-come se-ri-ous draw-backs As a gen-er-al thing there-fore you must first get fast to a whale be-fore any pitch-pol-ing comes in-to play Look now at Stubb a man who from his hu-mor-ous de-lib-er-ate cool-ness and equa-nim-i-ty in the direst emer-gen-cies was spe-cial-ly qual-i-fied to ex-cel in pitch-pol-ing Look at him he stands upright in the tossed bow of the fly-ing boat wrapt in fleecy foam the tow-ing whale is forty feet ahead Han-dling the long lance light-ly glanc-ing twice or thrice along its length to see if it be ex-act-ly straight Stubb whistling-ly gathers up the coil of the warp in one hand so as to se-cure its free end in his grasp leav-ing the rest unob-struct-ed Then hold-ing the lance full be-fore his waist-bandâ s mid-dle he levels it at the whale when cover-ing him with it he steadi-ly de-press-es the butt end in his hand there-by el-e-vat-ing the point till the weapon stands fair-ly balanced upon his palm fif-teen feet in the air He minds you some-what of a jug-gler balanc-ing a long staff on his chin Next mo-ment with a rapid name-less im-pulse in a su-perb lofty arch the bright steel spans the foam-ing dis-tance and quiv-ers in the life spot of the whale In-stead of sparkling water he now spouts red blood â That drove the spig-ot out of him â cried Stubb â â Tis Ju-lyâ s im-mor-tal Fourth all foun-tains must run wine to-day Would now it were old Or-leans whiskey or old Ohio or un-speak-able old Monon-ga-hela Then Tashtego lad Iâ d have ye hold a canakin to the jet and weâ d drink round it Yea ver-i-ly hearts alive weâ d brew choice punch in the spread of his spout hole there and from that live punch bowl quaff the liv-ing stuff â Again and again to such game-some talk the dex-ter-ous dart is re-peat-ed the spear re-turn-ing to its master like a grey-hound held in sk-il-ful leash The ago-nized whale goes in-to his flur-ry the tow line is slack-ened and the pitch-pol-er drop-ping astern folds his hands and mute-ly watch-es the mon-ster die CHAPTER 85 The Foun-tain That for six thou-sand yearsâ and no one knows how many mil-lions of ages be-foreâ the great whales should have been spout-ing all over the sea and sprin-kling and mis-ti-fy-ing the gar-dens of the deep as with so many sprin-kling or mis-ti-fy-ing pots and that for some cen-turies back thou-sands of hun-ters should have been close by the foun-tain of the whale watch-ing th-ese sprin-klings and spout-ingsâ that all this should be and yet that down to this blessed minute fif-teen and a quar-ter min-utes past one oâ clock P M of this six-teenth day of De-cem-ber A D 1851 it should still re-main a prob-lem whether th-ese spout-ings are after all real-ly water or noth-ing but va-porâ this is sure-ly a note-wor-thy thing Let us then look at this mat-ter along with some in-ter-est-ing items contin-gent Every one knows that by the pe-cu-liar cun-ning of their gil-ls the fin-ny tribes in gen-er-al breathe the air which at all times is com-bined with the ele-ment in which they swim hence a her-ring or a cod might live a cen-tu-ry and nev-er once raise its head above the sur-face But owing to his marked in-ter-nal struc-ture which gives him reg-u-lar lungs like a hu-man be-ingâ s the whale can on-ly live by in-hal-ing the disen-gaged air in the open at-mo-sphere Where-fore the ne-ces-si-ty for his pe-ri-od-i-cal visits to the up-per world But he can-not in any de-gree breathe through his mouth for in his or-di-nary at-ti-tude the Sperm Whaleâ s mouth is buried at least eight feet be-neath the sur-face and what is still more his wind-pipe has no con-nex-ion with his mouth No he breathes through his spir-a-cle alone and this is on the top of his head If I say that in any crea-ture breath-ing is on-ly a func-tion indis-pens-able to vi-tal-i-ty inas-much as it with-draws from the air a cer-tain ele-ment which be-ing sub-se-quent-ly brought in-to con-tact with the blood im-parts to the blood its viv-i-fy-ing prin-ci-ple I do not think I shall err though I may pos-si-bly use some su-per-flu-ous sci-en-tif-ic words As-sume it and it fol-lows that if all the blood in a man could be aer-at-ed with one breath he might then seal up his nostrils and not fetch another for a con-sid-er-able time That is to say he would then live without breath-ing Ano-ma-lous as it may seem this is pre-cise-ly the case with the whale who sys-tem-at-i-cal-ly lives by in-ter-vals his full hour and more when at the bot-tom without draw-ing a sin-gle breath or so much as in any way in-hal-ing a par-ti-cle of air for re-mem-ber he has no gil-ls How is this Between his ribs and on each side of his spine he is sup-plied with a re-mark-able in-volved Cre-tan labyrinth of ver-mi-cel-li like ves-sels which ves-sels when he quits the sur-face are com-plete-ly dis-tend-ed with oxy-genat-ed blood So that for an hour or more a thou-sand fath-oms in the sea he car-ries a sur-plus stock of vi-tal-i-ty in him just as the camel cross-ing the water-less desert car-ries a sur-plus sup-ply of drink for fu-ture use in its four sup-ple-men-tary stomachs The anatom-i-cal fact of this labyrinth is indis-putable and that the sup-po-si-tion found-ed upon it is rea-son-able and true seems the more co-gent to me when I con-sid-er the other-wise in-ex-pli-ca-ble ob-sti-na-cy of that le-viathan in hav-ing his spout-ings out as the fish-er-men phrase it This is what I mean If un-mo-lest-ed upon ris-ing to the sur-face the Sperm Whale will con-tin-ue there for a pe-ri-od of time ex-act-ly uni-form with all his other un-mo-lest-ed ris-ings Say he stays eleven min-utes and jets seven-ty times that is re-spires seven-ty breaths then when-ev-er he ris-es again he will be sure to have his seven-ty breaths over again to a minute Now if after he fetch-es a few breaths you alarm him so that he sounds he will be al-ways dodg-ing up again to make good his reg-u-lar al-lowance of air And not till those seven-ty breaths are told will he fi-nal-ly go down to stay out his full term below Re-mark how-ev-er that in dif-fer-ent in-di-vid-u-als th-ese rates are dif-fer-ent but in any one they are alike Now why should the whale thus in-sist upon hav-ing his spout-ings out un-less it be to re-plen-ish his reser-voir of air ere descend-ing for good How ob-vi-ous is it too that this ne-ces-si-ty for the whaleâ s ris-ing ex-pos-es him to all the fatal hazards of the chase For not by hook or by net could this vast le-viathan be caught when sail-ing a thou-sand fath-oms be-neath the sun-light Not so much thy skill then O hunter as the great ne-ces-si-ties that strike the vic-to-ry to thee In man breath-ing is inces-sant-ly go-ing onâ one breath on-ly serv-ing for two or three pul-sa-tions so that what-ev-er other busi-ness he has to at-tend to wak-ing or sleep-ing breathe he must or die he will But the Sperm Whale on-ly breathes about one seventh or Sun-day of his time It has been said that the whale on-ly breathes through his spout hole if it could truth-ful-ly be added that his spouts are mixed with water then I opine we should be fur-nished with the rea-son why his sense of smell seems oblit-er-at-ed in him for the on-ly thing about him that at all an-swers to his nose is that iden-ti-cal spout hole and be-ing so clogged with two ele-men-ts it could not be ex-pect-ed to have the pow-er of smelling But owing to the mys-tery of the spoutâ whether it be water or whether it be va-porâ no ab-so-lute cer-tain-ty can as yet be ar-rived at on this head Sure it is nev-er-the-less that the Sperm Whale has no prop-er ol-fac-to-ries But what does he want of them No ros-es no vi-o-lets no Cologne water in the sea Fur-ther-more as his wind-pipe sole-ly opens in-to the tube of his spout-ing canal and as that long canalâ like the grand Erie Canalâ is fur-nished with a sort of locks that open and shut for the down-ward re-ten-tion of air or the up-ward ex-clu-sion of water there-fore the whale has no voice un-less you in-sult him by say-ing that when he so strange-ly rum-bles he talks through his nose But then again what has the whale to say Sel-dom have I known any pro-found be-ing that had any-thing to say to this world un-less forced to stam-mer out some-thing by way of get-ting a liv-ing Oh hap-py that the world is such an ex-cel-lent lis-ten-er Now the spout-ing canal of the Sperm Whale chiefly in-tend-ed as it is for the con-veyance of air and for sev-er-al feet laid along hor-i-zon-tal-ly just be-neath the up-per sur-face of his head and a lit-tle to one side this cu-ri-ous canal is very much like a gas pipe laid down in a ci-ty on one side of a street But the ques-tion re-turns whether this gas pipe is al-so a water pipe in other words whether the spout of the Sperm Whale is the mere va-por of the ex-haled breath or whether that ex-haled breath is mixed with water tak-en in at the mouth and dis-charged through the spir-a-cle It is cer-tain that the mouth indi-rect-ly com-mu-ni-cates with the spout-ing canal but it can-not be proved that this is for the pur-pose of dis-charg-ing water through the spir-a-cle Be-cause the great-est ne-ces-si-ty for so do-ing would seem to be when in feed-ing he ac-ci-den-tal-ly takes in water But the Sperm Whaleâ s food is far be-neath the sur-face and there he can-not spout even if he would Be-sides if you re-gard him very close-ly and time him with your watch you will find that when un-mo-lest-ed there is an un-de-vi-at-ing rhyme between the pe-ri-ods of his jets and the or-di-nary pe-ri-ods of re-s-pi-ra-tion But why pester one with all this rea-son-ing on the sub-ject Speak out You have seen him spout then de-clare what the spout is can you not tell water from air My dear sir in this world it is not so easy to set-tle th-ese plain things I have ever found your plain things the knot-ti-est of all And as for this whale spout you might al-most stand in it and yet be un-de-cid-ed as to what it is pre-cise-ly The cen-tral body of it is hid-den in the snowy sparkling mist en-velop-ing it and how can you cer-tain-ly tell whether any water fal-ls from it when al-ways when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view of his spout he is in a prodi-gious com-mo-tion the water cas-cad-ing all around him And if at such times you should think that you real-ly per-ceived drops of mois-ture in the spout how do you know that they are not mere-ly con-densed from its va-por or how do you know that they are not those iden-ti-cal drops su-per-fi-cial-ly lodged in the spout hole fis-sure which is coun-ter-sunk in-to the sum-mit of the whaleâ s head For even when tran-quil-ly swim-ming through the mid day sea in a calm with his el-e-vat-ed hump sun dried as a dromedaryâ s in the desert even then the whale al-ways car-ries a small basin of water on his head as un-der a blaz-ing sun you will some-times see a cav-i-ty in a rock filled up with rain Nor is it at all pru-dent for the hunter to be over cu-ri-ous touch-ing the pre-cise na-ture of the whale spout It will not do for him to be peer-ing in-to it and put-ting his face in it You can-not go with your pitch-er to this foun-tain and fill it and bring it away For even when com-ing in-to slight con-tact with the outer va-pory shreds of the jet which will often hap-pen your skin will fev-er-ish-ly smart from the acrid-ness of the thing so touch-ing it And I know one who com-ing in-to still clos-er con-tact with the spout whether with some sci-en-tif-ic ob-ject in view or other-wise I can-not say the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm Where-fore among whale-men the spout is deemed poi-sonous they try to evade it Another thing I have heard it said and I do not much doubt it that if the jet is fair-ly spout-ed in-to your eyes it will blind you The wis-est thing the in-ves-ti-ga-tor can do then it seems to me is to let this dead-ly spout alone Still we can hy-poth-e-size even if we can-not prove and estab-lish My hy-poth-e-sis is this that the spout is noth-ing but mist And be-sides other rea-sons to this con-clu-sion I am im-pelled by con-sid-er-a-tions touch-ing the great in-her-ent dig-ni-ty and sublim-i-ty of the Sperm Whale I ac-count him no com-mon shal-low be-ing inas-much as it is an undis-put-ed fact that he is nev-er found on sound-ings or near shores all other whales some-times are He is both pon-der-ous and pro-found And I am con-vinced that from the heads of all pon-der-ous pro-found be-ings such as Pla-to Pyrrho the Devil Jupiter Dante and so on there al-ways goes up a cer-tain se-mi vis-i-ble steam while in the act of think-ing deep thoughts While com-pos-ing a lit-tle trea-tise on Eter-ni-ty I had the cu-rios-i-ty to place a mir-ror be-fore me and ere long saw re-flect-ed there a cu-ri-ous in-volved worm-ing and un-du-la-tion in the at-mo-sphere over my head The in-vari-able mois-ture of my hair while plunged in deep thought after six cups of hot tea in my thin shin-gled at-tic of an Au-gust noon this seems an ad-di-tion-al ar-gu-ment for the above sup-po-si-tion And how nobly it rais-es our con-ceit of the mighty misty mon-ster to be-hold him solemn-ly sail-ing through a calm trop-i-cal sea his vast mild head over-hung by a canopy of va-por en-gen-dered by his in-com-mu-ni-ca-ble con-tem-pla-tions and that va-porâ as you will some-times see itâ glori-fied by a rain-bow as if Heav-en it-self had put its seal upon his thoughts For dâ ye see rain-bows do not visit the clear air they on-ly ir-ra-di-ate va-por And so through all the thick mists of the dim doubts in my mind divine in-tu-itions now and then shoot enkin-dling my fog with a heav-en-ly ray And for this I thank God for all have doubts many de-ny but doubts or de-nials few along with them have in-tu-itions Doubts of all things earth-ly and in-tu-itions of some things heav-en-ly this com-bi-na-tion makes nei-ther believ-er nor in-fi-del but makes a man who re-gards them both with equal eye CHAPTER 86 The Tail Other poets have war-bled the prais-es of the soft eye of the an-te-lope and the love-ly plumage of the bird that nev-er alights less ce-les-tial I cel-e-brate a tail Reck-on-ing the largest sized Sperm Whaleâ s tail to be-gin at that point of the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man it com-pris-es upon its up-per sur-face alone an area of at least fifty square feet The com-pact round body of its root ex-pands in-to two broad firm flat palms or flukes grad-u-al-ly shoal-ing away to less than an inch in thick-ness At the crotch or junc-tion th-ese flukes slight-ly over-lap then side-ways re-cede from each other like wings leav-ing a wide va-can-cy between In no liv-ing thing are the lines of beau-ty more exquisite-ly de-fined than in the cres-cen-tic borders of th-ese flukes At its ut-most ex-pan-sion in the full grown whale the tail will con-sid-er-ably ex-ceed twen-ty feet across The en-tire mem-ber seems a dense webbed bed of weld-ed sinews but cut in-to it and you find that three distinct stra-ta com-pose it â up-per mid-dle and low-er The fi-bres in the up-per and low-er lay-ers are long and hor-i-zon-tal those of the mid-dle one very short and run-ning cross-wise between the out-side lay-ers This tri-une struc-ture as much as any-thing else im-parts pow-er to the tail To the stu-dent of old Ro-man wal-ls the mid-dle lay-er will fur-nish a cu-ri-ous par-al-lel to the thin course of tiles al-ways al-ter-nat-ing with the stone in those won-der-ful relics of the an-tique and which un-doubt-ed-ly con-tribute so much to the great strength of the ma-son-ry But as if this vast lo-cal pow-er in the tendi-nous tail were not enough the whole bulk of the le-viathan is knit over with a warp and woof of mus-cu-lar fi-bres and fil-a-men-ts which pass-ing on either side the loins and run-ning down in-to the flukes insen-si-bly blend with them and large-ly con-tribute to their might so that in the tail the con-flu-ent mea-sure-less force of the whole whale seems con-cen-trat-ed to a point Could an-ni-hi-la-tion oc-cur to mat-ter this were the thing to do it Nor does thisâ its amaz-ing strength at all tend to crip-ple the grace-ful flex-ion of its mo-tions where in-fan-tile-ness of ease un-du-lates through a Ti-tanism of pow-er On the con-trary those mo-tions derive their most ap-palling beau-ty from it Real strength nev-er im-pairs beau-ty or har-mo-ny but it often bestows it and in every-thing im-pos-ing-ly beau-ti-ful strength has much to do with the mag-ic Take away the tied ten-dons that all over seem burst-ing from the mar-ble in the carved Her-cules and its charm would be gone As devout Eck-er-man lift-ed the li-nen sheet from the naked corpse of Goethe he was over-whelmed with the mas-sive ch-est of the man that seemed as a Ro-man tri-umphal arch When An-ge-lo pain-ts even God the Father in hu-man form mark what ro-bust-ness is there And what-ev-er they may re-veal of the divine love in the Son the soft curled hermaphrodit-i-cal Ital-ian pic-tures in which his idea has been most suc-cess-ful-ly em-bod-ied th-ese pic-tures so desti-tute as they are of all brawni-ness hint noth-ing of any pow-er but the mere nega-tive fem-i-nine one of sub-mis-sion and en-durance which on all hands it is con-ced-ed form the pe-cu-liar prac-ti-cal virtues of his teach-ings Such is the sub-tle elas-tic-i-ty of the or-gan I treat of that whether wield-ed in sport or in earnest or in anger what-ev-er be the mood it be in its flex-ions are in-vari-ably marked by ex-ceed-ing grace There-in no fairyâ s arm can tran-scend it Five great mo-tions are pe-cu-liar to it First when used as a fin for pro-gres-sion Se-cond when used as a mace in bat-tle Third in sweep-ing Fourth in lob-tail-ing Fifth in peak-ing flukes First Be-ing hor-i-zon-tal in its po-si-tion the Le-viathanâ s tail ac-ts in a dif-fer-ent man-ner from the tails of all other sea crea-tures It nev-er wrig-gles In man or fish wrig-gling is a sign of in-fe-ri-or-i-ty To the whale his tail is the sole means of propul-sion Scroll wise coiled for-wards be-neath the body and then rapid-ly sprung back-wards it is this which gives that sin-gu-lar dart-ing leap-ing mo-tion to the mon-ster when fu-ri-ous-ly swim-ming His side fins on-ly serve to steer by Se-cond It is a lit-tle sig-nif-i-cant that while one sperm whale on-ly fights another sperm whale with his head and jaw nev-er-the-less in his con-flic-ts with man he chiefly and con-temp-tu-ous-ly us-es his tail In strik-ing at a boat he swift-ly curves away his flukes from it and the blow is on-ly in-flict-ed by the re-coil If it be made in the unob-struct-ed air espe-cial-ly if it descend to its mark the stroke is then sim-ply ir-re-sistible No ribs of man or boat can with-stand it Your on-ly sal-va-tion lies in elud-ing it but if it comes side-ways through the op-pos-ing water then part-ly owing to the light buoy-an-cy of the whale boat and the elas-tic-i-ty of its ma-te-ri-als a cracked rib or a dashed plank or two a sort of stitch in the side is gen-er-al-ly the most se-ri-ous re-sult Th-ese sub-merged side blows are so often re-ceived in the fish-ery that they are ac-count-ed mere childâ s play Some one strips off a frock and the hole is stopped Third I can-not de-mon-strate it but it seems to me that in the whale the sense of touch is con-cen-trat-ed in the tail for in this re-spect there is a del-i-ca-cy in it on-ly equalled by the dain-ti-ness of the ele-phan-tâ s trunk This del-i-ca-cy is chiefly evinced in the ac-tion of sweep-ing when in maiden-ly gentle-ness the whale with a cer-tain soft slow-ness moves his im-mense flukes from side to side upon the sur-face of the sea and if he feel but a sailorâ s whisker woe to that sailor whiskers and all What ten-der-ness there is in that pre-lim-i-nary touch Had this tail any pre-hen-sile pow-er I should straight-way be-think me of Dar-mon-odesâ ele-phant that so fre-quent-ed the flow-er mar-ket and with low sa-lu-ta-tions pre-sent-ed nosegays to dam-sels and then ca-ressed their zones On more ac-coun-ts than one a pi-ty it is that the whale does not possess this pre-hen-sile virtue in his tail for I have heard of yet another ele-phant that when wound-ed in the fight curved round his trunk and ex-tract-ed the dart Fourth Steal-ing unawares upon the whale in the fan-cied se-cu-ri-ty of the mid-dle of soli-tary seas you find him un-bent from the vast cor-pu-lence of his dig-ni-ty and kit-ten like he plays on the ocean as if it were a hearth But still you see his pow-er in his play The broad palms of his tail are flirt-ed high in-to the air then smit-ing the sur-face the thun-der-ous con-cus-sion re-sounds for miles You would al-most think a great gun had been dis-charged and if you no-ticed the light wreath of va-por from the spir-a-cle at his other ex-trem-i-ty you would think that that was the smoke from the touch hole Fifth As in the or-di-nary float-ing pos-ture of the le-viathan the flukes lie con-sid-er-ably below the lev-el of his back they are then com-plete-ly out of sight be-neath the sur-face but when he is about to plunge in-to the deeps his en-tire flukes with at least thir-ty feet of his body are tossed erect in the air and so re-main vi-brat-ing a mo-ment till they down-wards shoot out of view Ex-cept-ing the sublime breach â some-where else to be de-scribedâ this peak-ing of the whaleâ s flukes is per-haps the gran-d-est sight to be seen in all an-i-mat-ed na-ture Out of the bot-tom-less pro-fun-di-ties the gi-gan-tic tail seems spas-mod-i-cal-ly snatch-ing at the high-est heav-en So in dreams have I seen ma-jes-tic Satan thrust-ing forth his tor-ment-ed colos-sal claw from the flame Baltic of Hell But in gaz-ing at such scenes it is all in all what mood you are in if in the Dan-tean the devils will oc-cur to you if in that of Isa-iah the ar-changels Stand-ing at the mast head of my ship dur-ing a sun-rise that crim-soned sky and sea I once saw a large herd of whales in the east all head-ing towards the sun and for a mo-ment vi-brat-ing in con-cert with peaked flukes As it seemed to me at the time such a grand em-bod-i-ment of ado-ra-tion of the gods was nev-er be-held even in Per-sia the home of the fire wor-ship-pers As Ptole-my Philopa-ter tes-ti-fied of the African ele-phant I then tes-ti-fied of the whale pro-nounc-ing him the most devout of all be-ings For ac-cord-ing to King Ju-ba the mil-i-tary ele-phan-ts of an-tiq-ui-ty often hailed the morn-ing with their trunks uplift-ed in the pro-found-est si-lence The chance com-par-i-son in this chap-ter between the whale and the ele-phant so far as some aspec-ts of the tail of the one and the trunk of the other are con-cerned should not tend to place those two op-po-site or-gans on an equal-i-ty much less the crea-tures to which they re-spec-tive-ly be-long For as the might-i-est ele-phant is but a ter-ri-er to Le-viathan so com-pared with Le-viathanâ s tail his trunk is but the stalk of a li-ly The most dire-ful blow from the ele-phan-tâ s trunk were as the play-ful tap of a fan com-pared with the mea-sure-less crush and crash of the sperm whaleâ s pon-der-ous flukes which in re-peat-ed in-stances have one after the other hurled en-tire boats with all their oars and crews in-to the air very much as an In-di-an jug-gler toss-es his bal-ls Though all com-par-i-son in the way of gen-er-al bulk between the whale and the ele-phant is pre-pos-ter-ous inas-much as in that par-tic-u-lar the ele-phant stands in much the same re-spect to the whale that a dog does to the ele-phant nev-er-the-less there are not want-ing some poin-ts of cu-ri-ous simil-i-tude among th-ese is the spout It is well known that the ele-phant will often draw up water or dust in his trunk and then el-e-vat-ing it jet it forth in a stream The more I con-sid-er this mighty tail the more do I de-plore my in-abil-i-ty to ex-press it At times there are ges-tures in it which though they would well grace the hand of man re-main whol-ly in-ex-pli-ca-ble In an ex-ten-sive herd so re-mark-able oc-ca-sion-al-ly are th-ese mys-tic ges-tures that I have heard hun-ters who have de-clared them akin to Free Ma-son signs and sym-bols that the whale in-deed by th-ese meth-ods in-tel-li-gent-ly con-versed with the world Nor are there want-ing other mo-tions of the whale in his gen-er-al body full of strangeness and unac-count-able to his most ex-pe-ri-enced as-sailant Dis-sect him how I may then I but go skin deep I know him not and nev-er will But if I know not even the tail of this whale how un-der-stand his head much more how com-pre-hend his face when face he has none Thou shalt see my back parts my tail he seems to say but my face shall not be seen But I can-not com-plete-ly make out his back parts and hint what he will about his face I say again he has no face CHAPTER 87 The Grand Ar-ma-da The long and nar-row penin-su-la of Malac-ca ex-tend-ing south east-ward from the ter-ri-to-ries of Birmah for-ms the most souther-ly point of all Asia In a con-tin-u-ous line from that penin-su-la stretch the long is-lands of Su-ma-tra Ja-va Bal-ly and Ti-mor which with many others form a vast mole or ram-part length-wise con-nect-ing Asia with Aus-tralia and di-vid-ing the long un-bro-ken In-di-an ocean from the thick-ly stud-ded ori-en-tal archipela-goes This ram-part is pierced by sev-er-al sal-ly ports for the con-ve-nience of ships and whales con-spic-u-ous among which are the straits of Sun-da and Malac-ca By the straits of Sun-da chiefly ves-sels bound to Chi-na from the west emerge in-to the Chi-na seas Those nar-row straits of Sun-da di-vide Su-ma-tra from Ja-va and stand-ing mid-way in that vast ram-part of is-lands but-tressed by that bold green promon-to-ry known to sea-men as Ja-va Head they not a lit-tle cor-re-spond to the cen-tral gate-way open-ing in-to some vast walled em-pire and con-sid-er-ing the inex-haustible wealth of spices and silks and jewels and gold and ivory with which the thou-sand is-lands of that ori-en-tal sea are en-riched it seems a sig-nif-i-cant pro-vi-sion of na-ture that such trea-sures by the very for-ma-tion of the land should at least bear the ap-pear-ance how-ev-er in-ef-fec-tu-al of be-ing guard-ed from the all grasp-ing western world The shores of the Straits of Sun-da are un-sup-plied with those dom-i-neer-ing fortress-es which guard the en-trances to the Mediter-ranean the Baltic and the Pro-pon-tis Un-like the Danes th-ese Ori-en-tals do not de-mand the ob-se-quious ho-mage of low-ered top sails from the end-less pro-ces-sion of ships be-fore the wind which for cen-turies past by night and by day have passed between the is-lands of Su-ma-tra and Ja-va freight-ed with the costli-est car-goes of the east But while they freely waive a cer-e-mo-ni-al like this they do by no means re-nounce their claim to more sol-id tribute Time out of mind the pi-rat-i-cal proas of the Malays lurk-ing among the low shad-ed coves and islets of Su-ma-tra have sal-lied out upon the ves-sels sail-ing through the straits fierce-ly de-mand-ing tribute at the point of their spears Though by the re-peat-ed bloody chas-tise-men-ts they have re-ceived at the hands of Euro-pean cruis-ers the au-dac-i-ty of th-ese cor-sairs has of late been some-what re-pressed yet even at the pre-sent day we oc-ca-sion-al-ly hear of English and Amer-i-can ves-sels which in those waters have been re-morse-less-ly board-ed and pil-laged With a fair fresh wind the Pe-quod was now draw-ing nigh to th-ese straits Ahab pur-pos-ing to pass through them in-to the Ja-van sea and thence cruis-ing north-wards over waters known to be fre-quent-ed here and there by the Sperm Whale sweep in-shore by the Philip-pine Is-lands and gain the far coast of Ja-pan in time for the great whal-ing sea-son there By th-ese means the cir-cum-nav-i-gat-ing Pe-quod would sweep al-most all the known Sperm Whale cruis-ing grounds of the world pre-vi-ous to descend-ing upon the Line in the Pa-cif-ic where Ahab though every-where else foiled in his pur-suit firm-ly count-ed upon giv-ing bat-tle to Mo-by Dick in the sea he was most known to fre-quent and at a sea-son when he might most rea-son-ably be pre-sumed to be haunt-ing it But how now in this zoned quest does Ahab touch no land does his crew drink air Sure-ly he will stop for water Nay For a long time now the cir-cus run-ning sun has raced within his fiery ring and needs no sus-te-nance but whatâ s in him-self So Ahab Mark this too in the whaler While other hul-ls are load-ed down with alien stuff to be trans-ferred to for-eign wharves the world wan-der-ing whale ship car-ries no car-go but her-self and crew their weapons and their wan-ts She has a whole lakeâ s con-tents bot-tled in her am-ple hold She is bal-last-ed with util-i-ties not al-to-geth-er with unus-able pig lead and ken-tledge She car-ries yearsâ water in her Clear old prime Nan-tuck-et water which when three years afloat the Nan-tuck-eter in the Pa-cif-ic prefers to drink be-fore the brack-ish flu-id but yes-ter-day raft-ed off in casks from the Peru-vian or In-di-an streams Hence it is that while other ships may have gone to Chi-na from New York and back again touch-ing at a score of ports the whale ship in all that in-ter-val may not have sight-ed one grain of soil her crew hav-ing seen no man but float-ing sea-men like them-selves So that did you car-ry them the news that another flood had come they would on-ly an-swerâ â Well boys hereâ s the ark â Now as many Sperm Whales had been cap-tured off the western coast of Ja-va in the near vicin-i-ty of the Straits of Sun-da in-deed as most of the ground round-about was gen-er-al-ly recog-nised by the fish-er-men as an ex-cel-lent spot for cruis-ing there-fore as the Pe-quod gained more and more upon Ja-va Head the look outs were re-peat-ed-ly hailed and ad-mon-ished to keep wide awake But though the green palmy cliffs of the land soon loomed on the star-board bow and with de-light-ed nostrils the fresh cin-na-mon was snuffed in the air yet not a sin-gle jet was de-scried Al-most re-nounc-ing all thought of falling in with any game here-abouts the ship had well nigh en-tered the straits when the cus-tom-ary cheer-ing cry was heard from aloft and ere long a spec-ta-cle of sin-gu-lar mag-nif-i-cence sa-lut-ed us But here be it premised that owing to the un-wea-ried ac-tiv-i-ty with which of late they have been hunt-ed over all four oceans the Sperm Whales in-stead of al-most in-vari-ably sail-ing in small de-tached com-pa-nies as in former times are now fre-quent-ly met with in ex-ten-sive herds some-times em-brac-ing so great a mul-ti-tude that it would al-most seem as if numer-ous na-tions of them had sworn solemn league and covenant for mu-tu-al as-sis-tance and pro-tec-tion To this ag-gre-ga-tion of the Sperm Whale in-to such im-mense car-a-vans may be im-put-ed the cir-cum-stance that even in the best cruis-ing grounds you may now some-times sail for weeks and months to-geth-er without be-ing greet-ed by a sin-gle spout and then be sud-den-ly sa-lut-ed by what some-times seems thou-sands on thou-sands Broad on both bows at the dis-tance of some two or three miles and form-ing a great semi-cir-cle em-brac-ing one half of the lev-el hori-zon a con-tin-u-ous chain of whale jets were up play-ing and sparkling in the noon day air Un-like the straight per-pen-dic-u-lar twin jets of the Right Whale which di-vid-ing at top fall over in two branch-es like the cleft droop-ing boughs of a wil-low the sin-gle for-ward slant-ing spout of the Sperm Whale pre-sen-ts a thick curled bush of white mist con-tin-u-al-ly ris-ing and falling away to lee-ward Seen from the Pe-quodâ s deck then as she would rise on a high hill of the sea this host of va-pory spouts in-di-vid-u-al-ly curl-ing up in-to the air and be-held through a blend-ing at-mo-sphere of bluish haze showed like the thou-sand cheer-ful chim-neys of some dense metropo-lis de-scried of a balmy au-tum-nal morn-ing by some horse-man on a height As march-ing ar-mies ap-proach-ing an un-friend-ly de-file in the moun-tains ac-cel-er-ate their march all eager-ness to place that per-ilous pas-sage in their rear and once more ex-pand in com-par-a-tive se-cu-ri-ty upon the plain even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hur-ry-ing for-ward through the straits grad-u-al-ly con-tract-ing the wings of their semi-cir-cle and swim-ming on in one sol-id but still cres-cen-tic cen-tre Crowd-ing all sail the Pe-quod pressed after them the har-pooneers han-dling their weapons and loud-ly cheer-ing from the heads of their yet sus-pend-ed boats If the wind on-ly held lit-tle doubt had they that chased through th-ese Straits of Sun-da the vast host would on-ly de-ploy in-to the Ori-en-tal seas to wit-ness the cap-ture of not a few of their num-ber And who could tell whether in that con-gre-gat-ed car-a-van Mo-by Dick him-self might not tem-porar-i-ly be swim-ming like the wor-shipped white ele-phant in the corona-tion pro-ces-sion of the Si-amese So with stun sail piled on stun sail we sailed along driv-ing th-ese le-viathans be-fore us when of a sud-den the voice of Tashtego was heard loud-ly direct-ing at-ten-tion to some-thing in our wake Cor-re-spond-ing to the cres-cent in our van we be-held another in our rear It seemed formed of de-tached white va-pors ris-ing and falling some-thing like the spouts of the whales on-ly they did not so com-plete-ly come and go for they con-stant-ly hovered without fi-nal-ly dis-ap-pear-ing Lev-el-ling his glass at this sight Ahab quick-ly re-volved in his piv-ot hole cry-ing â Aloft there and rig whips and buck-ets to wet the sails â Malays sir and after us â As if too long lurk-ing be-hind the head-lands till the Pe-quod should fair-ly have en-tered the straits th-ese ras-cal-ly Asi-at-ics were now in hot pur-suit to make up for their over cau-tious de-lay But when the swift Pe-quod with a fresh lead-ing wind was her-self in hot chase how very kind of th-ese tawny phi-lan-thropists to as-sist in speed-ing her on to her own cho-sen pur-suit â mere rid-ing whips and row-els to her that they were As with glass un-der arm Ahab to and fro paced the deck in his for-ward turn be-hold-ing the mon-sters he chased and in the after one the blood-thirsty pi-rates chas-ing him some such fan-cy as the above seemed his And when he glanced upon the green wal-ls of the watery de-file in which the ship was then sail-ing and bethought him that through that gate lay the route to his vengeance and be-held how that through that same gate he was now both chas-ing and be-ing chased to his dead-ly end and not on-ly that but a herd of re-morse-less wild pi-rates and in-hu-man athe-is-ti-cal devils were in-fer-nal-ly cheer-ing him on with their curs-es â when all th-ese con-ceits had passed through his brain Ahabâ s brow was left gaunt and ribbed like the black sand beach after some stormy tide has been gnaw-ing it without be-ing able to drag the firm thing from its place But thoughts like th-ese trou-bled very few of the reck-less crew and when after steadi-ly drop-ping and drop-ping the pi-rates astern the Pe-quod at last shot by the vivid green Cock-a-too Point on the Su-ma-tra side emerg-ing at last upon the broad waters beyond then the har-pooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been gain-ing upon the ship than to re-joice that the ship had so vic-to-ri-ous-ly gained upon the Malays But still driv-ing on in the wake of the whales at length they seemed abat-ing their speed grad-u-al-ly the ship neared them and the wind now dy-ing away word was passed to spring to the boats But no soon-er did the herd by some pre-sumed won-der-ful in-stinct of the Sperm Whale be-come no-ti-fied of the three keels that were after them â though as yet a mile in their rear â than they ral-lied again and form-ing in close ranks and bat-tal-ions so that their spouts all looked like flash-ing lines of stacked bay-o-nets moved on with re-dou-bled ve-loc-i-ty Stripped to our shirts and draw-ers we sprang to the white ash and after sev-er-al hoursâ pulling were al-most dis-posed to re-nounce the chase when a gen-er-al paus-ing com-mo-tion among the whales gave an-i-mat-ing to-ken that they were now at last un-der the in-flu-ence of that strange per-plex-i-ty of in-ert ir-res-o-lu-tion which when the fish-er-men per-ceive it in the whale they say he is gal-lied The com-pact mar-tial colum-ns in which they had been hither-to rapid-ly and steadi-ly swim-ming were now bro-ken up in one mea-sure-less rout and like King Porusâ ele-phan-ts in the In-di-an bat-tle with Alexan-der they seemed go-ing mad with con-ster-na-tion In all direc-tions ex-pand-ing in vast ir-reg-u-lar cir-cles and aim-less-ly swim-ming hither and thith-er by their short thick spout-ings they plain-ly be-trayed their dis-trac-tion of pan-ic This was still more strange-ly evinced by those of their num-ber who com-plete-ly paral-ysed as it were help-less-ly float-ed like water logged dis-man-tled ships on the sea Had th-ese Le-viathans been but a flock of sim-ple sheep pur-sued over the pas-ture by three fierce wolves they could not pos-si-bly have evinced such ex-ces-sive dis-may But this oc-ca-sion-al timid-i-ty is char-ac-ter-is-tic of al-most all herd-ing crea-tures Though band-ing to-geth-er in tens of thou-sands the lion maned buf-faloes of the West have fled be-fore a soli-tary horse-man Wit-ness too all hu-man be-ings how when herd-ed to-geth-er in the sheep-fold of a theatreâ s pit they will at the slight-est alarm of fire rush hel-ter skel-ter for the out-lets crowd-ing tram-pling jam-ming and re-morse-less-ly dash-ing each other to death Best there-fore with-hold any amaze-ment at the strange-ly gal-lied whales be-fore us for there is no fol-ly of the beasts of the earth which is not in-finite-ly out-done by the mad-ness of men Though many of the whales as has been said were in vi-o-lent mo-tion yet it is to be ob-served that as a whole the herd nei-ther ad-vanced nor re-treat-ed but col-lec-tive-ly re-mained in one place As is cus-tom-ary in those cas-es the boats at once separat-ed each mak-ing for some one lone whale on the out-skirts of the shoal In about three min-utesâ time Quee-quegâ s har-poon was flung the strick-en fish dart-ed blind-ing spray in our faces and then run-ning away with us like light steered straight for the heart of the herd Though such a move-ment on the part of the whale struck un-der such cir-cum-stances is in no wise un-prece-dent-ed and in-deed is al-most al-ways more or less an-tic-i-pat-ed yet does it pre-sent one of the more per-ilous vi-cis-si-tudes of the fish-ery For as the swift mon-ster drags you deep-er and deep-er in-to the fran-tic shoal you bid adieu to cir-cum-spect life and on-ly ex-ist in a deliri-ous throb As blind and deaf the whale plunged for-ward as if by sheer pow-er of speed to rid him-self of the iron leech that had fas-tened to him as we thus tore a white gash in the sea on all sides me-naced as we flew by the crazed crea-tures to and fro rush-ing about us our be-set boat was like a ship mobbed by ice isles in a tem-pest and striv-ing to steer through their com-pli-cat-ed chan-nels and straits know-ing not at what mo-ment it may be locked in and crushed But not a bit daunt-ed Quee-queg steered us man-ful-ly now sheer-ing off from this mon-ster direct-ly across our route in ad-vance now edg-ing away from that whose colos-sal flukes were sus-pend-ed over-head while all the time Star-buck stood up in the bows lance in hand prick-ing out of our way what-ev-er whales he could reach by short darts for there was no time to make long ones Nor were the oars-men quite idle though their wont-ed du-ty was now al-to-geth-er dis-pensed with They chiefly at-tend-ed to the shout-ing part of the busi-ness â Out of the way Com-modore â cried one to a great dromedary that of a sud-den rose bodi-ly to the sur-face and for an in-stant threat-ened to swamp us â Hard down with your tail there â cried a se-cond to another which close to our gun-wale seemed calm-ly cool-ing him-self with his own fan like ex-trem-i-ty All whale-boats car-ry cer-tain cu-ri-ous con-trivances orig-i-nal-ly in-vent-ed by the Nan-tuck-et In-di-ans called drug-gs Two thick squares of wood of equal size are stout-ly clenched to-geth-er so that they cross each otherâ s grain at right an-gles a line of con-sid-er-able length is then at-tached to the mid-dle of this block and the other end of the line be-ing looped it can in a mo-ment be fas-tened to a har-poon It is chiefly among gal-lied whales that this drugg is used For then more whales are close round you than you can pos-si-bly chase at one time But sperm whales are not every day en-coun-tered while you may then you must kill all you can And if you can-not kill them all at once you must wing them so that they can be after-wards killed at your leisure Hence it is that at times like th-ese the drugg comes in-to req-ui-si-tion Our boat was fur-nished with three of them The first and se-cond were suc-cess-ful-ly dart-ed and we saw the whales stag-ger-ing-ly run-ning off fet-tered by the enor-mous side-long re-sis-tance of the tow-ing drugg They were cramped like male-fac-tors with the chain and ball But upon fling-ing the third in the act of toss-ing over-board the clum-sy wood-en block it caught un-der one of the seats of the boat and in an in-stant tore it out and car-ried it away drop-ping the oars-man in the boatâ s bot-tom as the seat slid from un-der him On both sides the sea came in at the wound-ed planks but we stuffed two or three draw-ers and shirts in and so stopped the leaks for the time It had been next to im-pos-si-ble to dart th-ese drugged har-poons were it not that as we ad-vanced in-to the herd our whaleâ s way great-ly di-min-ished more-over that as we went still fur-ther and fur-ther from the cir-cum-fer-ence of com-mo-tion the dire-ful disor-ders seemed wan-ing So that when at last the jerk-ing har-poon drew out and the tow-ing whale side-ways van-ished then with the taper-ing force of his part-ing mo-men-tum we glid-ed between two whales in-to the in-ner-most heart of the shoal as if from some moun-tain tor-rent we had slid in-to a serene val-ley lake Here the stor-ms in the roar-ing glens between the outer-most whales were heard but not felt In this cen-tral ex-panse the sea pre-sent-ed that smooth satin like sur-face called a sleek pro-duced by the sub-tle mois-ture thrown off by the whale in his more qui-et moods Yes we were now in that en-chant-ed calm which they say lurks at the heart of every com-mo-tion And still in the dis-tract-ed dis-tance we be-held the tu-mults of the outer con-cen-tric cir-cles and saw suc-ces-sive pods of whales eight or ten in each swift-ly go-ing round and round like mul-ti-plied spans of hors-es in a ring and so close-ly shoul-der to shoul-der that a Ti-tan-ic cir-cus rider might easi-ly have over arched the mid-dle ones and so have gone round on their backs Owing to the den-si-ty of the crowd of re-pos-ing whales more im-me-di-ate-ly sur-round-ing the em-bayed ax-is of the herd no pos-si-ble chance of es-cape was at pre-sent af-ford-ed us We must watch for a breach in the liv-ing wall that hemmed us in the wall that had on-ly ad-mit-ted us in order to shut us up Keep-ing at the cen-tre of the lake we were oc-ca-sion-al-ly visit-ed by small tame cows and calves the women and chil-dren of this rout-ed host Now in-clu-sive of the oc-ca-sion-al wide in-ter-vals between the re-volv-ing outer cir-cles and in-clu-sive of the spaces between the var-i-ous pods in any one of those cir-cles the en-tire area at this junc-ture em-braced by the whole mul-ti-tude must have con-tained at least two or three square miles At any rateâ though in-deed such a test at such a time might be de-cep-tiveâ spout-ings might be dis-cov-ered from our low boat that seemed play-ing up al-most from the rim of the hori-zon I men-tion this cir-cum-stance be-cause as if the cows and calves had been pur-pose-ly locked up in this in-ner-most fold and as if the wide ex-tent of the herd had hither-to prevent-ed them from learn-ing the pre-cise cause of its stop-ping or pos-si-bly be-ing so young un-so-phis-ti-cat-ed and every way in-no-cent and in-ex-pe-ri-enced how-ev-er it may have been th-ese smaller whalesâ now and then visit-ing our be-calmed boat from the mar-gin of the lakeâ evinced a won-drous fear-less-ness and con-fi-dence or else a still becharmed pan-ic which it was im-pos-si-ble not to marvel at Like house-hold dogs they came snuf-fling round us right up to our gun-wales and touch-ing them till it al-most seemed that some spell had sud-den-ly do-mes-ti-cat-ed them Quee-queg pat-ted their fore-heads Star-buck scratched their backs with his lance but fear-ful of the con-se-quences for the time re-frained from dart-ing it But far be-neath this won-drous world upon the sur-face another and still stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side For sus-pend-ed in those watery vaults float-ed the for-ms of the nurs-ing mothers of the whales and those that by their enor-mous girth seemed short-ly to be-come mothers The lake as I have hint-ed was to a con-sid-er-able depth ex-ceed-ing-ly trans-par-ent and as hu-man in-fan-ts while suck-ling will calm-ly and fixed-ly gaze away from the breast as if lead-ing two dif-fer-ent lives at the time and while yet draw-ing mor-tal nour-ish-ment be still spir-i-tu-al-ly feast-ing upon some un-earth-ly rem-i-nis-cence â even so did the young of th-ese whales seem look-ing up towards us but not at us as if we were but a bit of Gulfweed in their new born sight Float-ing on their sides the mothers al-so seemed qui-et-ly eye-ing us One of th-ese lit-tle in-fan-ts that from cer-tain queer to-kens seemed hard-ly a day old might have mea-sured some four-teen feet in length and some six feet in girth He was a lit-tle frisky though as yet his body seemed scarce yet re-cov-ered from that irk-some po-si-tion it had so late-ly oc-cu-pied in the ma-ter-nal retic-ule where tail to head and all ready for the fi-nal spring the un-born whale lies bent like a Tar-tarâ s bow The del-i-cate side fins and the palms of his flukes still fresh-ly re-tained the plait-ed crum-pled ap-pear-ance of a babyâ s ears new-ly ar-rived from for-eign parts â Line line â cried Quee-queg look-ing over the gun-wale â him fast him fast â Who line him Who struck â Two whale one big one lit-tle â â What ails ye man â cried Star-buck â Look e here â said Quee-queg point-ing down As when the strick-en whale that from the tub has reeled out hun-dreds of fath-oms of rope as after deep sound-ing he floats up again and shows the slack-ened curl-ing line buoy-ant-ly ris-ing and spi-ralling towards the air so now Star-buck saw long coils of the um-bil-i-cal cord of Madame Le-viathan by which the young cub seemed still tethered to its dam Not sel-dom in the rapid vi-cis-si-tudes of the chase this nat-u-ral line with the ma-ter-nal end loose be-comes en-tan-gled with the hem-pen one so that the cub is there-by trapped Some of the subtlest se-crets of the seas seemed divulged to us in this en-chant-ed pond We saw young Le-viathan amours in the deep The sperm whale as with all other species of the Le-viathan but un-like most other fish breeds in-dif-fer-ent-ly at all sea-sons after a ges-ta-tion which may prob-a-bly be set down at nine months pro-duc-ing but one at a time though in some few known in-stances giv-ing birth to an Esau and Ja-cob â a contin-gen-cy pro-vid-ed for in suck-ling by two teats cu-ri-ous-ly si-t-u-at-ed one on each side of the anus but the breasts them-selves ex-tend up-wards from that When by chance th-ese pre-cious parts in a nurs-ing whale are cut by the hun-terâ s lance the motherâ s pour-ing milk and blood ri-valling-ly dis-colour the sea for rods The milk is very sweet and rich it has been tast-ed by man it might do well with straw-ber-ries When over-flow-ing with mu-tu-al es-teem the whales sa-lute more hominum And thus though sur-round-ed by cir-cle upon cir-cle of con-ster-na-tions and af-frights did th-ese in-scrutable crea-tures at the cen-tre freely and fear-less-ly in-dulge in all peace-ful con-cern-men-ts yea serene-ly rev-elled in dal-liance and de-light But even so amid the tor-na-doed At-lantic of my be-ing do I my-self still for ever cen-tral-ly dis-port in mute calm and while pon-der-ous plan-ets of un-wan-ing woe re-volve round me deep down and deep in-land there I still bathe me in eter-nal mild-ness of joy Mean-while as we thus lay en-tranced the oc-ca-sion-al sud-den fran-tic spec-ta-cles in the dis-tance evinced the ac-tiv-i-ty of the other boats still en-gaged in drug-ging the whales on the fron-tier of the host or pos-si-bly car-ry-ing on the war within the first cir-cle where abun-dance of room and some con-ve-nient re-treats were af-ford-ed them But the sight of the en-raged drugged whales now and then blind-ly dart-ing to and fro across the cir-cles was noth-ing to what at last met our eyes It is some-times the cus-tom when fast to a whale more than com-mon-ly pow-er-ful and alert to seek to ham-string him as it were by sun-der-ing or maim-ing his gi-gan-tic tail ten-don It is done by dart-ing a short han-dled cut-ting spade to which is at-tached a rope for haul-ing it back again A whale wound-ed as we after-wards learned in this part but not ef-fec-tu-al-ly as it seemed had bro-ken away from the boat car-ry-ing along with him half of the har-poon line and in the ex-traor-di-nary agony of the wound he was now dash-ing among the re-volv-ing cir-cles like the lone mount-ed des-per-a-do Arnold at the bat-tle of Sarato-ga car-ry-ing dis-may wher-ev-er he went But ago-niz-ing as was the wound of this whale and an ap-palling spec-ta-cle enough any way yet the pe-cu-liar hor-ror with which he seemed to in-spire the rest of the herd was owing to a cause which at first the in-ter-ven-ing dis-tance ob-scured from us But at length we per-ceived that by one of the un-imag-in-able ac-ci-den-ts of the fish-ery this whale had be-come en-tan-gled in the har-poon line that he towed he had al-so run away with the cut-ting spade in him and while the free end of the rope at-tached to that weapon had per-ma-nent-ly caught in the coils of the har-poon line round his tail the cut-ting spade it-self had worked loose from his flesh So that tor-ment-ed to mad-ness he was now churn-ing through the water vi-o-lent-ly flail-ing with his flex-i-ble tail and toss-ing the keen spade about him wound-ing and mur-der-ing his own com-rades This ter-rif-ic ob-ject seemed to re-call the whole herd from their sta-tion-ary fright First the whales form-ing the mar-gin of our lake be-gan to crowd a lit-tle and tum-ble against each other as if lift-ed by half spent bil-lows from afar then the lake it-self be-gan faint-ly to heave and swell the sub-ma-rine bri-dal cham-bers and nurs-eries van-ished in more and more con-tract-ing or-bits the whales in the more cen-tral cir-cles be-gan to swim in thick-en-ing clus-ters Yes the long calm was depart-ing A low ad-vanc-ing hum was soon heard and then like to the tu-mul-tuous mass-es of block ice when the great riv-er Hud-son breaks up in Spring the en-tire host of whales came tum-bling upon their in-ner cen-tre as if to pile them-selves up in one com-mon moun-tain In-stant-ly Star-buck and Quee-queg changed places Star-buck tak-ing the stern â Oars Oars â he in-tense-ly whis-pered seiz-ing the helmâ â gripe your oars and clutch your souls now My God men stand by Shove him off you Quee-quegâ the whale there â prick him â hit him Stand upâ stand up and stay so Spring menâ pull men nev-er mind their back-sâ scrape them â scrape away â The boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks leav-ing a nar-row Dar-danelles between their long lengths But by des-per-ate en-deav-or we at last shot in-to a tem-po-rary open-ing then giv-ing way rapid-ly and at the same time earnest-ly watch-ing for another out-let After many sim-i-lar hair breadth es-capes we at last swift-ly glid-ed in-to what had just been one of the outer cir-cles but now crossed by ran-dom whales all vi-o-lent-ly mak-ing for one cen-tre This lucky sal-va-tion was cheaply pur-chased by the loss of Quee-quegâ s hat who while stand-ing in the bows to prick the fugi-tive whales had his hat tak-en clean from his head by the air ed-dy made by the sud-den toss-ing of a pair of broad flukes close by Riotous and disor-dered as the univer-sal com-mo-tion now was it soon re-solved it-self in-to what seemed a sys-tem-at-ic move-ment for hav-ing clumped to-geth-er at last in one dense body they then re-newed their on-ward flight with aug-ment-ed fleet-ness Fur-ther pur-suit was use-less but the boats still lin-gered in their wake to pick up what drugged whales might be dropped astern and like-wise to se-cure one which Flask had killed and waifed The waif is a pen-noned pole two or three of which are car-ried by every boat and which when ad-di-tion-al game is at hand are insert-ed upright in-to the float-ing body of a dead whale both to mark its place on the sea and al-so as to-ken of pri-or posses-sion should the boats of any other ship draw near The re-sult of this low-er-ing was some-what il-lus-tra-tive of that sa-ga-cious say-ing in the Fish-ery â the more whales the less fish Of all the drugged whales on-ly one was cap-tured The rest con-trived to es-cape for the time but on-ly to be tak-en as will hereafter be seen by some other craft than the Pe-quod CHAPTER 88 Schools and School-mas-ters The pre-vi-ous chap-ter gave ac-count of an im-mense body or herd of Sperm Whales and there was al-so then giv-en the prob-a-ble cause in-duc-ing those vast ag-gre-ga-tions Now though such great bodies are at times en-coun-tered yet as must have been seen even at the pre-sent day small de-tached bands are oc-ca-sion-al-ly ob-served em-brac-ing from twen-ty to fifty in-di-vid-u-als each Such bands are known as schools They gen-er-al-ly are of two sorts those com-posed al-most en-tire-ly of fe-males and those mus-ter-ing none but young vig-or-ous males or bul-ls as they are fa-mil-iar-ly des-ig-nat-ed In cava-lier at-ten-dance upon the school of fe-males you in-vari-ably see a male of full grown mag-ni-tude but not old who upon any alarm evinces his gal-lantry by falling in the rear and cover-ing the flight of his ladies In truth this gentle-man is a lux-u-ri-ous Ot-toman swim-ming about over the watery world sur-round-ing-ly ac-com-pa-nied by all the so-laces and en-dear-men-ts of the harem The con-trast between this Ot-toman and his con-cu-bines is strik-ing be-cause while he is al-ways of the largest le-viathanic pro-por-tions the ladies even at full growth are not more than one third of the bulk of an aver-age sized male They are com-par-a-tive-ly del-i-cate in-deed I dare say not to ex-ceed half a dozen yards round the waist Nev-er-the-less it can-not be de-nied that upon the whole they are hered-i-tar-i-ly en-ti-tled to en bon point It is very cu-ri-ous to watch this harem and its lord in their in-do-lent ram-blings Like fash-ion-ables they are for ever on the move in leisure-ly search of va-ri-ety You meet them on the Line in time for the full flow-er of the Equa-to-ri-al feed-ing sea-son hav-ing just re-turned per-haps from spend-ing the sum-mer in the North-ern seas and so cheat-ing sum-mer of all un-pleas-ant weari-ness and warmth By the time they have lounged up and down the prom-e-nade of the Equa-tor awhile they start for the Ori-en-tal waters in an-tic-i-pa-tion of the cool sea-son there and so evade the other ex-ces-sive tem-per-a-ture of the year When serene-ly ad-vanc-ing on one of th-ese jour-neys if any strange sus-pi-cious sights are seen my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his in-ter-est-ing fam-i-ly Should any un-war-rantably pert young Le-viathan com-ing that way pre-sume to draw con-fi-den-tial-ly close to one of the ladies with what prodi-gious fury the Bashaw as-sails him and chas-es him away High times in-deed if un-prin-ci-pled young rakes like him are to be per-mit-ted to in-vade the sanc-ti-ty of do-mes-tic bliss though do what the Bashaw will he can-not keep the most no-to-ri-ous Lothario out of his bed for alas all fish bed in com-mon As ashore the ladies often cause the most ter-ri-ble duels among their ri-val ad-mir-ers just so with the whales who some-times come to dead-ly bat-tle and all for love They fence with their long low-er jaws some-times lock-ing them to-geth-er and so striv-ing for the suprema-cy like elks that war-ring-ly in-ter-weave their antlers Not a few are cap-tured hav-ing the deep scars of th-ese en-coun-ters â fur-rowed heads bro-ken teeth scol-loped fins and in some in-stances wrenched and dis-lo-cat-ed mouths But sup-pos-ing the in-vad-er of do-mes-tic bliss to be-take him-self away at the first rush of the haremâ s lord then is it very divert-ing to watch that lord Gent-ly he insin-u-ates his vast bulk among them again and revels there awhile still in tan-taliz-ing vicin-i-ty to young Lothario like pious Solomon devout-ly wor-ship-ping among his thou-sand con-cu-bines Grant-ing other whales to be in sight the fish-er-men will sel-dom give chase to one of th-ese Grand Turks for th-ese Grand Turks are too lav-ish of their strength and hence their unc-tu-ous-ness is small As for the sons and the daugh-ters they beget why those sons and daugh-ters must take care of them-selves at least with on-ly the ma-ter-nal help For like cer-tain other om-niv-o-rous rov-ing lovers that might be named my Lord Whale has no taste for the nurs-ery how-ev-er much for the bow-er and so be-ing a great trav-eller he leaves his anony-mous ba-bies all over the world every ba-by an ex-ot-ic In good time nev-er-the-less as the ar-dour of youth de-clines as years and dumps in-crease as re-flec-tion lends her solemn paus-es in short as a gen-er-al las-si-tude over-takes the sat-ed Turk then a love of ease and virtue sup-plan-ts the love for maidens our Ot-toman en-ters upon the im-po-tent re-pen-tant ad-mon-i-to-ry stage of life for-swears dis-bands the harem and grown to an ex-em-plary sulky old soul goes about all alone among the merid-i-ans and par-al-lels say-ing his pray-ers and warn-ing each young Le-viathan from his amorous er-rors Now as the harem of whales is called by the fish-er-men a school so is the lord and master of that school tech-ni-cal-ly known as the school-mas-ter It is there-fore not in strict char-ac-ter how-ev-er ad-mirably satir-i-cal that after go-ing to school him-self he should then go abroad in-cul-cat-ing not what he learned there but the fol-ly of it His ti-tle school-mas-ter would very nat-u-ral-ly seem derived from the name bestowed upon the harem it-self but some have sur-mised that the man who first thus en-ti-tled this sort of Ot-toman whale must have read the me-moirs of Vi-docq and in-formed him-self what sort of a coun-try school-mas-ter that fa-mous French-man was in his younger days and what was the na-ture of those oc-cult les-sons he in-cul-cat-ed in-to some of his pupils The same se-clud-ed-ness and iso-la-tion to which the school-mas-ter whale be-takes him-self in his ad-vanc-ing years is true of all aged Sperm Whales Al-most univer-sal-ly a lone whaleâ as a soli-tary Le-viathan is calledâ proves an an-cient one Like ven-er-a-ble moss beard-ed Daniel Boone he will have no one near him but Na-ture her-self and her he takes to wife in the wilder-ness of waters and the best of wives she is though she keeps so many moody se-crets The schools com-pos-ing none but young and vig-or-ous males pre-vi-ous-ly men-tioned of-fer a strong con-trast to the harem schools For while those fe-male whales are char-ac-ter-is-ti-cal-ly timid the young males or forty bar-rel bul-ls as they call them are by far the most pug-na-cious of all Le-viathans and prover-bial-ly the most danger-ous to en-counter ex-cept-ing those won-drous grey head-ed griz-zled whales some-times met and th-ese will fight you like grim fiends ex-as-per-at-ed by a pe-nal gout The Forty bar-rel bull schools are larg-er than the harem schools Like a mob of young col-le-gians they are full of fight fun and wicked-ness tum-bling round the world at such a reck-less rol-lick-ing rate that no pru-dent un-der-writ-er would in-sure them any more than he would a riotous lad at Yale or Har-vard They soon relin-quish this tur-bu-lence though and when about three fourths grown break up and separate-ly go about in quest of set-tle-men-ts that is harems Another point of dif-fer-ence between the male and fe-male schools is still more char-ac-ter-is-tic of the sex-es Say you strike a Forty bar-rel bul-lâ poor devil all his com-rades quit him But strike a mem-ber of the harem school and her com-pan-ions swim around her with every to-ken of con-cern some-times lin-ger-ing so near her and so long as them-selves to fall a prey CHAPTER 89 Fast Fish and Loose Fish The al-lu-sion to the waif and waif poles in the last chap-ter but one ne-ces-si-tates some ac-count of the laws and reg-u-la-tions of the whale fish-ery of which the waif may be deemed the grand sym-bol and badge It fre-quent-ly hap-pens that when sev-er-al ships are cruis-ing in com-pa-ny a whale may be struck by one ves-sel then es-cape and be fi-nal-ly killed and cap-tured by another ves-sel and here-in are indi-rect-ly com-prised many mi-nor contin-gen-cies all par-tak-ing of this one grand fea-ture For ex-am-ple â after a weary and per-ilous chase and cap-ture of a whale the body may get loose from the ship by rea-son of a vi-o-lent storm and drift-ing far away to lee-ward be re-tak-en by a se-cond whaler who in a calm snug-ly tows it along-side without risk of life or line Thus the most vex-a-tious and vi-o-lent dis-putes would often arise between the fish-er-men were there not some writ-ten or un-writ-ten univer-sal undis-put-ed law ap-pli-ca-ble to all cas-es Per-haps the on-ly for-mal whal-ing code autho-rized by leg-isla-tive en-act-ment was that of Hol-land It was de-creed by the States Gen-er-al in A D 1695 But though no other na-tion has ever had any writ-ten whal-ing law yet the Amer-i-can fish-er-men have been their own leg-is-la-tors and lawyers in this mat-ter They have pro-vid-ed a sys-tem which for terse com-pre-hen-sive-ness sur-pass-es Jus-tini-anâ s Pan-dec-ts and the By laws of the Chi-nese So-ci-ety for the Sup-pres-sion of Med-dling with other Peo-pleâ s Busi-ness Yes th-ese laws might be en-graven on a Queen An-neâ s farthing or the barb of a har-poon and worn round the neck so small are they I A Fast Fish be-longs to the par-ty fast to it II A Loose Fish is fair game for any-body who can soon-est catch it But what plays the mis-chief with this master-ly code is the ad-mirable brevi-ty of it which ne-ces-si-tates a vast vol-ume of com-men-taries to ex-pound it First What is a Fast Fish Alive or dead a fish is tech-ni-cal-ly fast when it is con-nect-ed with an oc-cu-pied ship or boat by any medi-um at all con-trol-lable by the oc-cu-pant or oc-cu-pan-ts â a mast an oar a nine inch cable a tele-graph wire or a strand of cob-web it is all the same Like-wise a fish is tech-ni-cal-ly fast when it bears a waif or any other recog-nised sym-bol of posses-sion so long as the par-ty waif-ing it plain-ly evince their abil-i-ty at any time to take it along-side as well as their in-ten-tion so to do Th-ese are sci-en-tif-ic com-men-taries but the com-men-taries of the whale-men them-selves some-times con-sist in hard words and harder knock-sâ the Coke upon Lit-tle-ton of the fist True among the more upright and honor-able whale-men al-lowances are al-ways made for pe-cu-liar cas-es where it would be an ou-tra-geous mo-ral in-jus-tice for one par-ty to claim posses-sion of a whale pre-vi-ous-ly chased or killed by another par-ty But others are by no means so scrupu-lous Some fifty years ago there was a cu-ri-ous case of whale trover lit-i-gat-ed in Eng-land where-in the plain-tiffs set forth that after a hard chase of a whale in the North-ern seas and when in-deed they the plain-tiffs had suc-ceed-ed in har-poon-ing the fish they were at last through per-il of their lives obliged to for-sake not on-ly their lines but their boat it-self Ul-ti-mate-ly the de-fen-dan-ts the crew of another ship came up with the whale struck killed seized and fi-nal-ly ap-pro-pri-at-ed it be-fore the very eyes of the plain-tiffs And when those de-fen-dan-ts were re-mon-strat-ed with their cap-tain snapped his fingers in the plain-tiff-sâ teeth and as-sured them that by way of dox-ol-o-gy to the deed he had done he would now re-tain their line har-poons and boat which had re-mained at-tached to the whale at the time of the seizure Where-fore the plain-tiffs now sued for the re-cov-ery of the value of their whale line har-poons and boat Mr Ersk-ine was coun-sel for the de-fen-dan-ts Lord El-len-bor-ough was the judge In the course of the de-fence the wit-ty Ersk-ine went on to il-lus-trate his po-si-tion by al-lud-ing to a re-cent crim con case where-in a gentle-man after in vain try-ing to bri-dle his wifeâ s vi-cious-ness had at last aban-doned her upon the seas of life but in the course of years re-pent-ing of that step he in-sti-tut-ed an ac-tion to re-cov-er posses-sion of her Ersk-ine was on the other side and he then sup-port-ed it by say-ing that though the gentle-man had orig-i-nal-ly har-pooned the lady and had once had her fast and on-ly by rea-son of the great stress of her plung-ing vi-cious-ness had at last aban-doned her yet aban-don her he did so that she be-came a loose fish and there-fore when a sub-se-quent gentle-man re har-pooned her the lady then be-came that sub-se-quent gentle-manâ s prop-er-ty along with what-ev-er har-poon might have been found stick-ing in her Now in the pre-sent case Ersk-ine con-tend-ed that the ex-am-ples of the whale and the lady were re-cip-ro-cal-ly il-lus-tra-tive of each other Th-ese plead-ings and the counter plead-ings be-ing du-ly heard the very learned judge in set ter-ms de-cid-ed to wit â That as for the boat he award-ed it to the plain-tiffs be-cause they had mere-ly aban-doned it to save their lives but that with re-gard to the con-tro-vert-ed whale har-poons and line they be-longed to the de-fen-dan-ts the whale be-cause it was a Loose Fish at the time of the fi-nal cap-ture and the har-poons and line be-cause when the fish made off with them it the fish ac-quired a prop-er-ty in those ar-ti-cles and hence any-body who after-wards took the fish had a right to them Now the de-fen-dan-ts after-wards took the fish er-go the afore-said ar-ti-cles were theirs A com-mon man look-ing at this de-ci-sion of the very learned Judge might pos-si-bly ob-ject to it But ploughed up to the pri-ma-ry rock of the mat-ter the two great prin-ci-ples laid down in the twin whal-ing laws pre-vi-ous-ly quot-ed and ap-plied and elu-ci-dat-ed by Lord El-len-bor-ough in the above cit-ed case th-ese two laws touch-ing Fast Fish and Loose Fish I say will on re-flec-tion be found the fun-da-men-tals of all hu-man jurispru-dence for notwith-stand-ing its com-pli-cat-ed trac-ery of sculp-ture the Tem-ple of the Law like the Tem-ple of the Philistines has but two props to stand on Is it not a say-ing in every oneâ s mouth Posses-sion is half of the law that is re-gard-less of how the thing came in-to posses-sion But often posses-sion is the whole of the law What are the sinews and souls of Rus-sian serfs and Repub-li-can slaves but Fast Fish where-of posses-sion is the whole of the law What to the ra-pa-cious land-lord is the wi-d-owâ s last mite but a Fast Fish What is yon-der un-de-tect-ed vil-lainâ s mar-ble man-sion with a door plate for a waif what is that but a Fast Fish What is the ruinous dis-count which Morde-cai the bro-ker gets from poor Woe-be-gone the bankrupt on a loan to keep Woe-be-goneâ s fam-i-ly from star-va-tion what is that ruinous dis-count but a Fast Fish What is the Arch-bish-op of Savesoulâ s in-come of Â 1  seized from the scant bread and cheese of hun-dreds of thou-sands of bro-ken backed la-bor-ers all sure of heav-en without any of Savesoulâ s help what is that glob-u-lar Â 1  but a Fast Fish What are the Duke of Dun-derâ s hered-i-tary towns and ham-lets but Fast Fish What to that re-doubt-ed har-pooneer John Bull is poor Ire-land but a Fast Fish What to that apos-tolic lancer Brother Jonathan is Texas but a Fast Fish And con-cern-ing all th-ese is not Posses-sion the whole of the law But if the doc-trine of Fast Fish be pret-ty gen-er-al-ly ap-pli-ca-ble the kin-dred doc-trine of Loose Fish is still more wide-ly so That is in-ter-na-tion-al-ly and univer-sal-ly ap-pli-ca-ble What was Amer-i-ca in 1492 but a Loose Fish in which Colum-bus struck the Span-ish stan-dard by way of waif-ing it for his roy-al master and mistress What was Poland to the Czar What Greece to the Turk What In-dia to Eng-land What at last will Mex-i-co be to the Unit-ed States All Loose Fish What are the Rights of Man and the Lib-er-ties of the World but Loose Fish What all menâ s minds and opin-ions but Loose Fish What is the prin-ci-ple of reli-gious belief in them but a Loose Fish What to the os-ten-ta-tious smug-gling ver-bal-ists are the thoughts of thinkers but Loose Fish What is the great globe it-self but a Loose Fish And what are you read-er but a Loose Fish and a Fast Fish too CHAPTER 9 Heads or Tails â De bale-na vero suf-ficit si rex habeat ca-put et regi-na cau-dam â Brac-ton l 3 c 3 Latin from the books of the Laws of Eng-land which tak-en along with the con-text means that of all whales cap-tured by any-body on the coast of that land the King as Honorary Grand Har-pooneer must have the head and the Queen be re-spect-ful-ly pre-sent-ed with the tail A divi-sion which in the whale is much like halv-ing an ap-ple there is no in-ter-me-di-ate re-main-der Now as this law un-der a mod-i-fied form is to this day in force in Eng-land and as it of-fers in var-i-ous re-spec-ts a strange ano-ma-ly touch-ing the gen-er-al law of Fast and Loose Fish it is here treat-ed of in a separate chap-ter on the same cour-te-ous prin-ci-ple that promp-ts the English rail-ways to be at the ex-pense of a separate car spe-cial-ly re-served for the ac-com-mo-da-tion of roy-al-ty In the first place in cu-ri-ous proof of the fact that the above men-tioned law is still in force I pro-ceed to lay be-fore you a cir-cum-stance that hap-pened within the last two years It seems that some hon-est mariners of Dover or Sand-wich or some one of the Cinque Ports had after a hard chase suc-ceed-ed in killing and beach-ing a fine whale which they had orig-i-nal-ly de-scried afar off from the shore Now the Cinque Ports are par-tial-ly or some-how un-der the juris-dic-tion of a sort of po-lice-man or bea-dle called a Lord War-den Hold-ing the of-fice direct-ly from the crown I believe all the roy-al emol-u-men-ts in-ci-dent to the Cinque Port ter-ri-to-ries be-come by as-sign-ment his By some writ-ers this of-fice is called a sinecure But not so Be-cause the Lord War-den is busi-ly em-ployed at times in fob-bing his perquisites which are his chiefly by virtue of that same fob-bing of them Now when th-ese poor sun burnt mariners bare foot-ed and with their trowsers rolled high up on their ee-ly legs had weari-ly hauled their fat fish high and dry promis-ing them-selves a good Â 15 from the pre-cious oil and bone and in fan-ta-sy sip-ping rare tea with their wives and good ale with their cronies upon the strength of their re-spec-tive shares up steps a very learned and most Chris-tian and char-i-ta-ble gentle-man with a copy of Black-stone un-der his arm and lay-ing it upon the whaleâ s head he saysâ â Hands off this fish my masters is a Fast Fish I seize it as the Lord War-denâ s â Upon this the poor mariners in their re-spect-ful con-ster-na-tionâ so tru-ly Englishâ know-ing not what to say fall to vig-or-ous-ly scratch-ing their heads all round mean-while rue-ful-ly glanc-ing from the whale to the stranger But that did in no-wise mend the mat-ter or at all soften the hard heart of the learned gentle-man with the copy of Black-stone At length one of them after long scratch-ing about for his ideas made bold to speak â Please sir who is the Lord War-den â â The Duke â â But the duke had noth-ing to do with tak-ing this fish â â It is his â â We have been at great trou-ble and per-il and some ex-pense and is all that to go to the Dukeâ s ben-e-fit we get-ting noth-ing at all for our pains but our blis-ters â â It is his â â Is the Duke so very poor as to be forced to this des-per-ate mode of get-ting a liveli-hood â â It is his â â I thought to relieve my old bed rid-den mother by part of my share of this whale â â It is his â â Wonâ t the Duke be con-tent with a quar-ter or a half â â It is his â In a word the whale was seized and sold and his Grace the Duke of Welling-ton re-ceived the money Think-ing that viewed in some par-tic-u-lar lights the case might by a bare pos-si-bil-i-ty in some small de-gree be deemed un-der the cir-cum-stances a rather hard one an hon-est cler-gy-man of the town re-spect-ful-ly ad-dressed a note to his Grace beg-ging him to take the case of those un-for-tu-nate mariners in-to full con-sid-er-a-tion To which my Lord Duke in sub-stance replied both let-ters were pub-lished that he had al-ready done so and re-ceived the money and would be obliged to the rev-erend gentle-man if for the fu-ture he the rev-erend gentle-man would de-cline med-dling with other peo-pleâ s busi-ness Is this the still mil-i-tant old man stand-ing at the corners of the three king-doms on all hands co-erc-ing alms of beg-gars It will read-i-ly be seen that in this case the al-leged right of the Duke to the whale was a del-e-gat-ed one from the Sovereign We must needs in-quire then on what prin-ci-ple the Sovereign is orig-i-nal-ly in-vest-ed with that right The law it-self has al-ready been set forth But Plow-don gives us the rea-son for it Says Plow-don the whale so caught be-longs to the King and Queen â be-cause of its su-pe-ri-or ex-cel-lence â And by the sound-est com-men-ta-tors this has ever been held a co-gent ar-gu-ment in such mat-ters But why should the King have the head and the Queen the tail A rea-son for that ye lawyers In his trea-tise on â Queen Gold â or Queen pin-money an old Kingâ s Bench author one Wil-liam Prynne thus dis-courseth â Ye tail is ye Queenâ s that ye Queenâ s wardrobe may be sup-plied with ye whale-bone â Now this was writ-ten at a time when the black lim-ber bone of the Green-land or Right whale was large-ly used in ladiesâ bodices But this same bone is not in the tail it is in the head which is a sad mis-take for a sa-ga-cious lawyer like Prynne But is the Queen a mer-maid to be pre-sent-ed with a tail An al-le-gor-i-cal mean-ing may lurk here There are two roy-al fish so styled by the English law writ-er-sâ the whale and the stur-geon both roy-al prop-er-ty un-der cer-tain lim-i-ta-tions and nom-i-nal-ly sup-ply-ing the tenth branch of the crownâ s or-di-nary rev-enue I know not that any other author has hint-ed of the mat-ter but by in-fer-ence it seems to me that the stur-geon must be di-vid-ed in the same way as the whale the King re-ceiv-ing the high-ly dense and elas-tic head pe-cu-liar to that fish which sym-bol-i-cal-ly re-gard-ed may pos-si-bly be hu-mor-ous-ly ground-ed upon some pre-sumed con-ge-nial-i-ty And thus there seems a rea-son in all things even in law CHAPTER 91 The Pe-quod Meets The Rose Bud â In vain it was to rake for Am-ber-griese in the paunch of this Le-viathan in-suf-fer-able fe-tor deny-ing not in-quiry â Sir T Browne V E It was a week or two after the last whal-ing scene re-count-ed and when we were slow-ly sail-ing over a sleepy va-pory mid day sea that the many nos-es on the Pe-quodâ s deck proved more vig-i-lant dis-cov-er-ers than the three pairs of eyes aloft A pe-cu-liar and not very pleas-ant smell was smelt in the sea â I will bet some-thing now â said Stubb â that some-where here-abouts are some of those drugged whales we tick-led the other day I thought they would keel up be-fore long â Present-ly the va-pors in ad-vance slid aside and there in the dis-tance lay a ship whose furled sails be-to-kened that some sort of whale must be along-side As we glid-ed nearer the stranger showed French colours from his peak and by the ed-dy-ing cloud of vul-ture sea fowl that cir-cled and hovered and swooped around him it was plain that the whale along-side must be what the fish-er-men call a blast-ed whale that is a whale that has died un-mo-lest-ed on the sea and so float-ed an unap-pro-pri-at-ed corpse It may well be con-ceived what an un-sa-vory odor such a mass must ex-hale worse than an Assyr-i-an ci-ty in the plague when the liv-ing are in-com-pe-tent to bury the depart-ed So in-tol-er-a-ble in-deed is it re-gard-ed by some that no cu-pid-i-ty could per-suade them to moor along-side of it Yet are there those who will still do it notwith-stand-ing the fact that the oil ob-tained from such sub-jec-ts is of a very in-fe-ri-or qual-i-ty and by no means of the na-ture of at-tar of rose Com-ing still nearer with the ex-pir-ing breeze we saw that the French-man had a se-cond whale along-side and this se-cond whale seemed even more of a nosegay than the first In truth it turned out to be one of those prob-lem-at-i-cal whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort of prodi-gious dyspep-sia or indi-ges-tion leav-ing their de-funct bodies al-most en-tire-ly bankrupt of any-thing like oil Nev-er-the-less in the prop-er place we shall see that no know-ing fish-er-man will ever turn up his nose at such a whale as this how-ev-er much he may shun blast-ed whales in gen-er-al The Pe-quod had now swept so nigh to the stranger that Stubb vowed he recog-nised his cut-ting spade pole en-tan-gled in the lines that were knot-ted round the tail of one of th-ese whales â Thereâ s a pret-ty fel-low now â he ban-ter-ing-ly laughed stand-ing in the shipâ s bows â thereâ s a jack-al for ye I well know that th-ese Crap-poes of French-men are but poor devils in the fish-ery some-times low-er-ing their boats for break-ers mis-tak-ing them for Sperm Whale spouts yes and some-times sail-ing from their port with their hold full of box-es of tal-low can-dles and cas-es of snuffers fore-see-ing that all the oil they will get wonâ t be enough to dip the Cap-tainâ s wick in-to aye we all know th-ese things but look ye hereâ s a Crap-po that is con-tent with our leav-ings the drugged whale there I mean aye and is con-tent too with scrap-ing the dry bones of that other pre-cious fish he has there Poor devil I say pass round a hat some one and letâ s make him a pre-sent of a lit-tle oil for dear char-i-tyâ s sake For what oil heâ ll get from that drugged whale there would-nâ t be fit to burn in a jail no not in a con-demned cell And as for the other whale why Iâ ll agree to get more oil by chop-ping up and try-ing out th-ese three masts of ours than heâ ll get from that bun-dle of bones though now that I think of it it may con-tain some-thing worth a good deal more than oil yes am-ber-gris I won-der now if our old man has thought of that Itâ s worth try-ing Yes Iâ m for it â and so say-ing he start-ed for the quar-ter deck By this time the faint air had be-come a com-plete calm so that whether or no the Pe-quod was now fair-ly en-trapped in the smell with no hope of es-cap-ing ex-cept by its breez-ing up again Is-su-ing from the cabin Stubb now called his boatâ s crew and pulled off for the stranger Draw-ing across her bow he per-ceived that in ac-cor-dance with the fan-ci-ful French taste the up-per part of her stem piece was carved in the like-ness of a huge droop-ing stalk was paint-ed green and for thorns had cop-per spikes pro-ject-ing from it here and there the whole ter-mi-nat-ing in a sym-met-ri-cal fold-ed bulb of a bright red colour Upon her head boards in large gilt let-ters he read â Bou-ton de Rose â â Rose but-ton or Rose bud and this was the ro-man-tic name of this aro-mat-ic ship Though Stubb did not un-der-stand the Bou-ton part of the in-scrip-tion yet the word rose and the bul-bous fig-ure head put to-geth-er suf-fi-cient-ly ex-plained the whole to him â A wood-en rose bud eh â he cried with his hand to his nose â that will do very well but how like all creation it smel-ls â Now in order to hold direct com-mu-ni-ca-tion with the peo-ple on deck he had to pull round the bows to the star-board side and thus come close to the blast-ed whale and so talk over it Ar-rived then at this spot with one hand still to his nose he bawledâ â Bou-ton de Rose ahoy are there any of you Bou-ton de Ros-es that speak English â â Yes â re-joined a Guernsey man from the bul-warks who turned out to be the chief mate â Well then my Bou-ton de Rose bud have you seen the White Whale â â What whale â â The White Whaleâ a Sperm Whaleâ Mo-by Dick have ye seen him â Nev-er heard of such a whale Cachalot Blanche White Whaleâ no â â Very good then good bye now and Iâ ll call again in a minute â Then rapid-ly pulling back towards the Pe-quod and see-ing Ahab lean-ing over the quar-ter deck rail await-ing his re-port he mould-ed his two hands in-to a trum-pet and shout-edâ â No Sir No â Upon which Ahab re-tired and Stubb re-turned to the French-man He now per-ceived that the Guernsey man who had just got in-to the chains and was us-ing a cut-ting spade had slung his nose in a sort of bag â Whatâ s the mat-ter with your nose there â said Stubb â Broke it â â I wish it was bro-ken or that I did-nâ t have any nose at all â an-swered the Guernsey man who did not seem to rel-ish the job he was at very much â But what are you hold-ing yours for â â Oh noth-ing Itâ s a wax nose I have to hold it on Fine day ainâ t it Air rather gar-den-ny I should say throw us a bunch of posies will ye Bou-ton de Rose â â What in the devilâ s name do you want here â roared the Guernsey-man fly-ing in-to a sud-den pas-sion â Oh keep coolâ cool yes thatâ s the word why donâ t you pack those whales in ice while youâ re work-ing at â em But jok-ing aside though do you know Rose bud that itâ s all non-sense try-ing to get any oil out of such whales As for that dried up one there he has-nâ t a gill in his whole car-case â â I know that well enough but dâ ye see the Cap-tain here wonâ t believe it this is his first voy-age he was a Cologne man-u-fac-turer be-fore But come aboard and may-hap heâ ll believe you if he wonâ t me and so Iâ ll get out of this dir-ty scrape â â Any-thing to oblige ye my sweet and pleas-ant fel-low â re-joined Stubb and with that he soon mount-ed to the deck There a queer scene pre-sent-ed it-self The sailors in tas-selled caps of red worsted were get-ting the heavy tack-les in readi-ness for the whales But they worked rather slow and talked very fast and seemed in any-thing but a good hu-mor All their nos-es up-ward-ly pro-ject-ed from their faces like so many jib booms Now and then pairs of them would drop their work and run up to the mast head to get some fresh air Some think-ing they would catch the plague dipped oakum in coal tar and at in-ter-vals held it to their nostrils Others hav-ing bro-ken the stems of their pipes al-most short off at the bowl were vig-or-ous-ly puff-ing tobac-co smoke so that it con-stant-ly filled their ol-fac-to-ries Stubb was struck by a show-er of outcries and anath-e-mas pro-ceed-ing from the Cap-tainâ s round house abaft and look-ing in that direc-tion saw a fiery face thrust from be-hind the door which was held ajar from within This was the tor-ment-ed sur-geon who after in vain re-mon-strat-ing against the pro-ceed-ings of the day had be-tak-en him-self to the Cap-tainâ s round house cabi-net he called it to avoid the pest but still could not help yelling out his en-treaties and indig-na-tions at times Mark-ing all this Stubb ar-gued well for his scheme and turn-ing to the Guernsey man had a lit-tle chat with him dur-ing which the stranger mate ex-pressed his detes-ta-tion of his Cap-tain as a con-ceit-ed ig-no-ra-mus who had brought them all in-to so un-sa-vory and un-prof-itable a pick-le Sound-ing him care-ful-ly Stubb fur-ther per-ceived that the Guernsey man had not the slight-est sus-pi-cion con-cern-ing the am-ber-gris He there-fore held his peace on that head but other-wise was quite frank and con-fi-den-tial with him so that the two quick-ly con-coct-ed a lit-tle plan for both cir-cum-vent-ing and sat-i-riz-ing the Cap-tain without his at all dream-ing of distrust-ing their sin-cer-i-ty Ac-cord-ing to this lit-tle plan of theirs the Guernsey man un-der cover of an in-ter-preterâ s of-fice was to tell the Cap-tain what he pleased but as com-ing from Stubb and as for Stubb he was to ut-ter any non-sense that should come up-per-most in him dur-ing the in-ter-view By this time their destined vic-tim ap-peared from his cabin He was a small and dark but rather del-i-cate look-ing man for a sea cap-tain with large whiskers and mous-tache how-ev-er and wore a red cot-ton velvet vest with watch seals at his side To this gentle-man Stubb was now po-lite-ly in-tro-duced by the Guernsey man who at once os-ten-ta-tious-ly put on the aspect of in-ter-pret-ing between them â What shall I say to him first â said he â Why â said Stubb eye-ing the velvet vest and the watch and seals â you may as well be-gin by telling him that he looks a sort of baby-ish to me though I donâ t pre-tend to be a judge â â He says Mon-sieur â said the Guernsey man in French turn-ing to his cap-tain â that on-ly yes-ter-day his ship spoke a ves-sel whose cap-tain and chief mate with six sailors had all died of a fev-er caught from a blast-ed whale they had brought along-side â Upon this the cap-tain start-ed and eager-ly de-sired to know more â What now â said the Guernsey man to Stubb â Why since he takes it so easy tell him that now I have eyed him care-ful-ly Iâ m quite cer-tain that heâ s no more fit to com-mand a whale ship than a St Ja-go mon-key In fact tell him from me heâ s a ba-boon â â He vows and de-clares Mon-sieur that the other whale the dried one is far more dead-ly than the blast-ed one in fine Mon-sieur he con-jures us as we value our lives to cut loose from th-ese fish â In-stant-ly the cap-tain ran for-ward and in a loud voice com-mand-ed his crew to de-sist from hoist-ing the cut-ting tack-les and at once cast loose the cables and chains con-fin-ing the whales to the ship â What now â said the Guernsey man when the Cap-tain had re-turned to them â Why let me see yes you may as well tell him now thatâ thatâ in fact tell him Iâ ve did-dled him and aside to him-self per-haps some-body else â â He says Mon-sieur that heâ s very hap-py to have been of any ser-vice to us â Hear-ing this the cap-tain vowed that they were the grate-ful par-ties mean-ing him-self and mate and con-clud-ed by invit-ing Stubb down in-to his cabin to drink a bot-tle of Bordeaux â He wan-ts you to take a glass of wine with him â said the in-ter-preter â Thank him hearti-ly but tell him itâ s against my prin-ci-ples to drink with the man Iâ ve did-dled In fact tell him I must go â â He says Mon-sieur that his prin-ci-ples wonâ t ad-mit of his drink-ing but that if Mon-sieur wan-ts to live another day to drink then Mon-sieur had best drop all four boats and pull the ship away from th-ese whales for itâ s so calm they wonâ t drift â By this time Stubb was over the side and get-ting in-to his boat hailed the Guernsey man to this ef-fect â that hav-ing a long tow line in his boat he would do what he could to help them by pulling out the lighter whale of the two from the shipâ s side While the French-manâ s boats then were en-gaged in tow-ing the ship one way Stubb benev-o-lent-ly towed away at his whale the other way os-ten-ta-tious-ly slack-ing out a most unusu-al-ly long tow line Present-ly a breeze sprang up Stubb feigned to cast off from the whale hoist-ing his boats the French-man soon in-creased his dis-tance while the Pe-quod slid in between him and Stub-bâ s whale Where-upon Stubb quick-ly pulled to the float-ing body and hail-ing the Pe-quod to give no-tice of his in-ten-tions at once pro-ceed-ed to reap the fruit of his un-righ-teous cun-ning Seiz-ing his sharp boat spade he com-menced an ex-ca-va-tion in the body a lit-tle be-hind the side fin You would al-most have thought he was dig-ging a cel-lar there in the sea and when at length his spade struck against the gaunt ribs it was like turn-ing up old Ro-man tiles and pot-tery buried in fat English loam His boatâ s crew were all in high ex-cite-ment eager-ly help-ing their chief and look-ing as anx-ious as gold hun-ters And all the time num-ber-less fowls were div-ing and duck-ing and scream-ing and yelling and fight-ing around them Stubb was begin-ning to look dis-ap-point-ed espe-cial-ly as the hor-ri-ble nosegay in-creased when sud-den-ly from out the very heart of this plague there stole a faint stream of per-fume which flowed through the tide of bad smel-ls without be-ing ab-sorbed by it as one riv-er will flow in-to and then along with another without at all blend-ing with it for a time â I have it I have it â cried Stubb with de-light strik-ing some-thing in the subter-ranean re-gions â a purse a purse â Drop-ping his spade he thrust both hands in and drew out hand-fuls of some-thing that looked like ripe Wind-sor soap or rich mot-tled old cheese very unc-tu-ous and sa-vory withal You might easi-ly dent it with your thumb it is of a hue between yel-low and ash colour And this good friends is am-ber-gris worth a gold guinea an ounce to any drug-gist Some six hand-fuls were ob-tained but more was unavoid-ably lost in the sea and still more per-haps might have been se-cured were it not for im-pa-tient Ahabâ s loud com-mand to Stubb to de-sist and come on board else the ship would bid them good bye CHAPTER 92 Am-ber-gris Now this am-ber-gris is a very cu-ri-ous sub-stance and so im-por-tant as an ar-ti-cle of com-merce that in 1791 a cer-tain Nan-tuck-et born Cap-tain Cof-fin was ex-am-ined at the bar of the English House of Com-mons on that sub-ject For at that time and in-deed un-til a com-par-a-tive-ly late day the pre-cise ori-gin of am-ber-gris re-mained like am-ber it-self a prob-lem to the learned Though the word am-ber-gris is but the French com-pound for grey am-ber yet the two sub-stances are quite distinct For am-ber though at times found on the sea coast is al-so dug up in some far in-land soils where-as am-ber-gris is nev-er found ex-cept upon the sea Be-sides am-ber is a hard trans-par-ent brit-tle odor-less sub-stance used for mouth pieces to pipes for beads and or-na-men-ts but am-ber-gris is soft waxy and so high-ly fra-grant and spicy that it is large-ly used in per-fumery in pastiles pre-cious can-dles hair pow-ders and po-ma-tum The Turks use it in cook-ing and al-so car-ry it to Mec-ca for the same pur-pose that frank-in-cense is car-ried to St Peterâ s in Rome Some wine mer-chan-ts drop a few grains in-to claret to fla-vor it Who would think then that such fine ladies and gentle-men should re-gale them-selves with an essence found in the in-glo-ri-ous bow-els of a sick whale Yet so it is By some am-ber-gris is sup-posed to be the cause and by others the ef-fect of the dyspep-sia in the whale How to cure such a dyspep-sia it were hard to say un-less by ad-min-is-ter-ing three or four boat loads of Bran-drethâ s pil-ls and then run-ning out of har-mâ s way as la-bor-ers do in blast-ing rocks I have for-got-ten to say that there were found in this am-ber-gris cer-tain hard round bony plates which at first Stubb thought might be sailorsâ trowsers but-tons but it after-wards turned out that they were noth-ing more than pieces of small squid bones em-balmed in that man-ner Now that the in-cor-rup-tion of this most fra-grant am-ber-gris should be found in the heart of such de-cay is this noth-ing Be-think thee of that say-ing of St Paul in Corinthi-ans about cor-rup-tion and in-cor-rup-tion how that we are sown in dis-hon-or but raised in glo-ry And like-wise call to mind that say-ing of Paracel-sus about what it is that maketh the best musk Al-so for-get not the strange fact that of all things of ill sa-vor Cologne water in its rudi-men-tal man-u-fac-tur-ing stages is the worst I should like to con-clude the chap-ter with the above ap-peal but can-not owing to my anx-i-ety to re-pel a charge often made against whale-men and which in the es-ti-ma-tion of some al-ready bi-ased minds might be con-sid-ered as indi-rect-ly sub-stan-ti-at-ed by what has been said of the French-manâ s two whales Else-where in this vol-ume the slan-der-ous asper-sion has been dis-proved that the vo-ca-tion of whal-ing is through-out a slat-tern-ly un-tidy busi-ness But there is another thing to re-but They hint that all whales al-ways smell bad Now how did this odious stig-ma orig-i-nate I opine that it is plain-ly trace-able to the first ar-rival of the Green-land whal-ing ships in Lon-don more than two cen-turies ago Be-cause those whale-men did not then and do not now try out their oil at sea as the South-ern ships have al-ways done but cut-ting up the fresh blub-ber in small bits thrust it through the bung holes of large casks and car-ry it home in that man-ner the short-ness of the sea-son in those Icy Seas and the sud-den and vi-o-lent stor-ms to which they are ex-posed for-bid-ding any other course The con-se-quence is that upon break-ing in-to the hold and un-load-ing one of th-ese whale ceme-ter-ies in the Green-land dock a sa-vor is giv-en forth some-what sim-i-lar to that aris-ing from ex-ca-vat-ing an old ci-ty grave yard for the foun-da-tions of a Ly-ing in Hospi-tal I part-ly sur-mise al-so that this wicked charge against whalers may be like-wise im-put-ed to the ex-is-tence on the coast of Green-land in former times of a Dutch vil-lage called Sch-meren-burgh or Smeeren-berg which lat-ter name is the one used by the learned Fo-go Von Slack in his great work on Smel-ls a text book on that sub-ject As its name im-ports smeer fat berg to put up this vil-lage was found-ed in order to af-ford a place for the blub-ber of the Dutch whale fleet to be tried out without be-ing tak-en home to Hol-land for that pur-pose It was a col-lec-tion of fur-naces fat ket-tles and oil sheds and when the works were in full oper-a-tion cer-tain-ly gave forth no very pleas-ant sa-vor But all this is quite dif-fer-ent with a South Sea Sperm Whaler which in a voy-age of four years per-haps after com-plete-ly filling her hold with oil does not per-haps con-sume fifty days in the busi-ness of boil-ing out and in the state that it is casked the oil is near-ly scent-less The truth is that liv-ing or dead if but de-cent-ly treat-ed whales as a species are by no means crea-tures of ill odor nor can whale-men be recog-nised as the peo-ple of the mid-dle ages af-fect-ed to de-tect a Jew in the com-pa-ny by the nose Nor in-deed can the whale pos-si-bly be other-wise than fra-grant when as a gen-er-al thing he en-joys such high health tak-ing abun-dance of ex-er-cise al-ways out of doors though it is true sel-dom in the open air I say that the mo-tion of a Sperm Whaleâ s flukes above water dis-pens-es a per-fume as when a musk scent-ed lady rus-tles her dress in a warm par-lor What then shall I liken the Sperm Whale to for fra-grance con-sid-er-ing his mag-ni-tude Must it not be to that fa-mous ele-phant with jewelled tusks and redo-lent with myrrh which was led out of an In-di-an town to do honor to Alexan-der the Great CHAPTER 93 The Cast-away It was but some few days after en-coun-ter-ing the French-man that a most sig-nif-i-cant event be-fell the most in-signif-i-cant of the Pe-quodâ s crew an event most la-mentable and which end-ed in pro-vid-ing the some-times mad-ly mer-ry and pre-des-ti-nat-ed craft with a liv-ing and ever ac-com-pa-ny-ing prophe-cy of what-ev-er shat-tered se-quel might prove her own Now in the whale ship it is not every one that goes in the boats Some few hands are re-served called ship keep-ers whose province it is to work the ves-sel while the boats are pur-su-ing the whale As a gen-er-al thing th-ese ship keep-ers are as hardy fel-lows as the men com-pris-ing the boat-sâ crews But if there hap-pen to be an un-du-ly slen-der clum-sy or ti-morous wight in the ship that wight is cer-tain to be made a ship keep-er It was so in the Pe-quod with the lit-tle ne-gro Pip-pin by nick name Pip by ab-bre-vi-a-tion Poor Pip ye have heard of him be-fore ye must re-mem-ber his tam-bourine on that dra-mat-ic mid-night so gloomy jol-ly In outer aspect Pip and Dough Boy made a match like a black pony and a white one of equal devel-op-men-ts though of dis-sim-i-lar colour driv-en in one ec-cen-tric span But while hap-less Dough Boy was by na-ture dull and tor-pid in his in-tel-lec-ts Pip though over ten-der heart-ed was at bot-tom very bright with that pleas-ant ge-nial jol-ly bright-ness pe-cu-liar to his tribe a tribe which ever en-joy all hol-i-days and fes-tiv-i-ties with fin-er freer rel-ish than any other race For blacks the yearâ s cal-en-dar should show naught but three hun-dred and six-ty five Fourth of Ju-lys and New Yearâ s Days Nor smile so while I write that this lit-tle black was bril-liant for even black-ness has its bril-lian-cy be-hold yon lus-trous ebony panelled in kingâ s cabi-nets But Pip loved life and all lifeâ s peace-able se-cu-ri-ties so that the pan-ic strik-ing busi-ness in which he had some-how unac-count-ably be-come en-trapped had most sad-ly blurred his bright-ness though as ere long will be seen what was thus tem-porar-i-ly sub-dued in him in the end was destined to be lurid-ly il-lu-mined by strange wild fires that fic-ti-tious-ly showed him off to ten times the nat-u-ral lus-tre with which in his na-tive Tol-land Coun-ty in Con-necti-cut he had once en-livened many a fid-dlerâ s frolic on the green and at melo-di-ous even tide with his gay ha ha had turned the round hori-zon in-to one star belled tam-bourine So though in the clear air of day sus-pend-ed against a blue veined neck the pure watered di-a-mond drop will health-ful glow yet when the cun-ning jeweller would show you the di-a-mond in its most im-pres-sive lus-tre he lays it against a gloomy ground and then lights it up not by the sun but by some un-nat-u-ral gas-es Then come out those fiery ef-ful-gences in-fer-nal-ly su-perb then the evil blaz-ing di-a-mond once the divinest sym-bol of the crys-tal skies looks like some crown jewel stolen from the King of Hell But let us to the sto-ry It came to pass that in the am-ber-gris af-fair Stub-bâ s after oars-man chanced so to sprain his hand as for a time to be-come quite maimed and tem-porar-i-ly Pip was put in-to his place The first time Stubb low-ered with him Pip evinced much ner-vous-ness but hap-pi-ly for that time es-caped close con-tact with the whale and there-fore came off not al-to-geth-er dis-cred-itably though Stubb ob-serv-ing him took care after-wards to ex-hort him to cher-ish his coura-geous-ness to the ut-most for he might often find it need-ful Now upon the se-cond low-er-ing the boat pad-dled upon the whale and as the fish re-ceived the dart-ed iron it gave its cus-tom-ary rap which hap-pened in this in-stance to be right un-der poor Pipâ s seat The in-vol-un-tary con-ster-na-tion of the mo-ment caused him to leap pad-dle in hand out of the boat and in such a way that part of the slack whale line com-ing against his ch-est he breast-ed it over-board with him so as to be-come en-tan-gled in it when at last plump-ing in-to the water That in-stant the strick-en whale start-ed on a fierce run the line swift-ly straight-ened and presto poor Pip came all foam-ing up to the chocks of the boat re-morse-less-ly dragged there by the line which had tak-en sev-er-al turns around his ch-est and neck Tashtego stood in the bows He was full of the fire of the hunt He hat-ed Pip for a poltroon Snatch-ing the boat knife from its sheath he sus-pend-ed its sharp edge over the line and turn-ing towards Stubb ex-claimed in-ter-rog-a-tive-ly â Cut â Mean-time Pipâ s blue choked face plain-ly looked Do for Godâ s sake All passed in a flash In less than half a minute this en-tire thing hap-pened â Damn him cut â roared Stubb and so the whale was lost and Pip was saved So soon as he re-cov-ered him-self the poor lit-tle ne-gro was as-sailed by yel-ls and ex-e-cra-tions from the crew Tran-quil-ly per-mit-ting th-ese ir-reg-u-lar curs-ings to eva-po-rate Stubb then in a plain busi-ness like but still half hu-mor-ous man-ner cursed Pip of-fi-cial-ly and that done unof-fi-cial-ly gave him much whole-some ad-vice The sub-stance was Nev-er jump from a boat Pip ex-cep-tâ but all the rest was in-def-i-nite as the sound-est ad-vice ever is Now in gen-er-al Stick to the boat is your true mot-to in whal-ing but cas-es will some-times hap-pen when Leap from the boat is still bet-ter More-over as if per-ceiv-ing at last that if he should give undi-lut-ed con-sci-en-tious ad-vice to Pip he would be leav-ing him too wide a mar-gin to jump in for the fu-ture Stubb sud-den-ly dropped all ad-vice and con-clud-ed with a peremp-to-ry com-mand â Stick to the boat Pip or by the Lord I wonâ t pick you up if you jump mind that We canâ t af-ford to lose whales by the likes of you a whale would sell for thir-ty times what you would Pip in Alaba-ma Bear that in mind and donâ t jump any more â Here-by per-haps Stubb indi-rect-ly hint-ed that though man loved his fel-low yet man is a money mak-ing an-i-mal which propen-si-ty too often in-ter-feres with his benev-o-lence But we are all in the hands of the Gods and Pip jumped again It was un-der very sim-i-lar cir-cum-stances to the first per-for-mance but this time he did not breast out the line and hence when the whale start-ed to run Pip was left be-hind on the sea like a hur-ried trav-ellerâ s trunk Alas Stubb was but too true to his word It was a beau-ti-ful boun-teous blue day the span-gled sea calm and cool and flat-ly stretch-ing away all round to the hori-zon like gold beaterâ s skin ham-mered out to the ex-tremest Bob-bing up and down in that sea Pipâ s ebon head showed like a head of cloves No boat knife was lift-ed when he fell so rapid-ly astern Stub-bâ s inex-orable back was turned upon him and the whale was winged In three min-utes a whole mile of shore-less ocean was between Pip and Stubb Out from the cen-tre of the sea poor Pip turned his crisp curl-ing black head to the sun another lone-ly cast-away though the lofti-est and the bright-est Now in calm weather to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the prac-tised swim-mer as to ride in a spring car-riage ashore But the aw-ful lone-some-ness is in-tol-er-a-ble The in-tense con-cen-tra-tion of self in the mid-dle of such a heart-less im-men-si-ty my God who can tell it Mark how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open seaâ mark how close-ly they hug their ship and on-ly coast along her sides But had Stubb real-ly aban-doned the poor lit-tle ne-gro to his fate No he did not mean to at least Be-cause there were two boats in his wake and he sup-posed no doubt that they would of course come up to Pip very quick-ly and pick him up though in-deed such con-sid-er-a-tions towards oars-men jeop-ar-dized through their own timid-i-ty is not al-ways man-i-fest-ed by the hun-ters in all sim-i-lar in-stances and such in-stances not un-fre-quent-ly oc-cur al-most in-vari-ably in the fish-ery a coward so called is marked with the same ruth-less detes-ta-tion pe-cu-liar to mil-i-tary navies and ar-mies But it so hap-pened that those boats without see-ing Pip sud-den-ly spy-ing whales close to them on one side turned and gave chase and Stub-bâ s boat was now so far away and he and all his crew so in-tent upon his fish that Pipâ s ringed hori-zon be-gan to ex-pand around him mis-er-ably By the mer-est chance the ship it-self at last res-cued him but from that hour the lit-tle ne-gro went about the deck an idiot such at least they said he was The sea had jeer-ing-ly kept his fi-nite body up but drowned the in-fi-nite of his soul Not drowned en-tire-ly though Rather car-ried down alive to won-drous depths where strange shapes of the un-warped pri-mal world glid-ed to and fro be-fore his pas-sive eyes and the mis-er mer-man Wis-dom re-vealed his hoard-ed heaps and among the joy-ous heart-less ever ju-ve-nile eter-ni-ties Pip saw the mul-ti-tudi-nous God om-nipresent co-ral in-sec-ts that out of the fir-ma-ment of waters heaved the colos-sal or-bs He saw Godâ s foot upon the trea-dle of the loom and spoke it and there-fore his ship-mates called him mad So manâ s in-san-i-ty is heav-enâ s sense and wan-der-ing from all mor-tal rea-son man comes at last to that ce-les-tial thought which to rea-son is ab-surd and fran-tic and weal or woe feels then un-com-pro-mised in-dif-fer-ent as his God For the rest blame not Stubb too hard-ly The thing is com-mon in that fish-ery and in the se-quel of the nar-ra-tive it will then be seen what like aban-don-ment be-fell my-self CHAPTER 94 A Squeeze of the Hand That whale of Stub-bâ s so dear-ly pur-chased was du-ly brought to the Pe-quodâ s side where all those cut-ting and hoist-ing oper-a-tions pre-vi-ous-ly de-tailed were reg-u-lar-ly gone through even to the bal-ing of the Hei-del-burgh Tun or Case While some were oc-cu-pied with this lat-ter du-ty others were em-ployed in drag-ging away the larg-er tubs so soon as filled with the sperm and when the prop-er time ar-rived this same sperm was care-ful-ly ma-nip-u-lat-ed ere go-ing to the try works of which anon It had cooled and crys-tal-lized to such a de-gree that when with sev-er-al others I sat down be-fore a large Con-stan-tineâ s bath of it I found it strange-ly con-cret-ed in-to lumps here and there rolling about in the liq-uid part It was our busi-ness to squeeze th-ese lumps back in-to flu-id A sweet and unc-tu-ous du-ty No won-der that in old times this sperm was such a favourite cos-met-ic Such a clearer such a sweet-en-er such a soften-er such a de-li-cious mo-lifi-er After hav-ing my hands in it for on-ly a few min-utes my fingers felt like eels and be-gan as it were to ser-pen-tine and spi-ralise As I sat there at my ease cross legged on the deck after the bit-ter ex-er-tion at the wind-lass un-der a blue tran-quil sky the ship un-der in-do-lent sail and glid-ing so serene-ly along as I bathed my hands among those soft gen-tle glob-ules of in-fil-trat-ed tis-sues woven al-most within the hour as they rich-ly broke to my fingers and dis-charged all their opu-lence like ful-ly ripe grapes their wine as I snuffed up that un-con-tam-i-nat-ed aro-ma â lit-er-al-ly and tru-ly like the smell of spring vi-o-lets I de-clare to you that for the time I lived as in a musky mead-ow I for-got all about our hor-ri-ble oath in that in-ex-press-ible sperm I washed my hands and my heart of it I al-most be-gan to cred-it the old Paracel-san su-per-sti-tion that sperm is of rare virtue in al-lay-ing the heat of anger while bathing in that bath I felt divine-ly free from all ill will or pe-tu-lance or mal-ice of any sort what-so-ev-er Squeeze squeeze squeeze all the morn-ing long I squeezed that sperm till I my-self al-most melt-ed in-to it I squeezed that sperm till a strange sort of in-san-i-ty came over me and I found my-self un-wit-ting-ly squeez-ing my co la-bor-ersâ hands in it mis-tak-ing their hands for the gen-tle glob-ules Such an abound-ing af-fec-tion-ate friend-ly lov-ing feel-ing did this avo-ca-tion beget that at last I was con-tin-u-al-ly squeez-ing their hands and look-ing up in-to their eyes sen-ti-men-tal-ly as much as to say â Oh my dear fel-low be-ings why should we longer cher-ish any so-cial acer-bities or know the slight-est ill hu-mor or en-vy Come let us squeeze hands all round nay let us all squeeze our-selves in-to each other let us squeeze our-selves univer-sal-ly in-to the very milk and sperm of kind-ness Would that I could keep squeez-ing that sperm for ever For now since by many pro-longed re-peat-ed ex-pe-ri-ences I have per-ceived that in all cas-es man must even-tu-al-ly low-er or at least shift his con-ceit of at-tain-able felic-i-ty not plac-ing it any-where in the in-tel-lect or the fan-cy but in the wife the heart the bed the table the sad-dle the fire-side the coun-try now that I have per-ceived all this I am ready to squeeze case eter-nal-ly In thoughts of the vi-sions of the night I saw long rows of an-gels in par-adise each with his hands in a jar of sper-ma-ceti Now while dis-cours-ing of sperm it be-hooves to speak of other things akin to it in the busi-ness of prepar-ing the sperm whale for the try works First comes white horse so called which is ob-tained from the taper-ing part of the fish and al-so from the thick-er por-tions of his flukes It is tough with congealed ten-don-sâ a wad of mus-cleâ but still con-tains some oil After be-ing sev-ered from the whale the white horse is first cut in-to portable ob-longs ere go-ing to the min-cer They look much like blocks of Berk-shire mar-ble Plum pud-ding is the term bestowed upon cer-tain frag-men-tary parts of the whaleâ s flesh here and there ad-her-ing to the blan-ket of blub-ber and often par-tic-i-pat-ing to a con-sid-er-able de-gree in its unc-tu-ous-ness It is a most re-fresh-ing con-vivial beau-ti-ful ob-ject to be-hold As its name im-ports it is of an ex-ceed-ing-ly rich mot-tled tint with a bestreaked snowy and gold-en ground dot-ted with spots of the deep-est crim-son and pur-ple It is plums of ru-bies in pic-tures of citron Spite of rea-son it is hard to keep your-self from eat-ing it I con-fess that once I stole be-hind the fore-mast to try it It tast-ed some-thing as I should con-ceive a roy-al cut-let from the thigh of Louis le Gros might have tast-ed sup-pos-ing him to have been killed the first day after the veni-son sea-son and that par-tic-u-lar veni-son sea-son con-tem-po-rary with an unusu-al-ly fine vin-tage of the vine-yards of Cham-pagne There is another sub-stance and a very sin-gu-lar one which turns up in the course of this busi-ness but which I feel it to be very puz-zling ad-e-quate-ly to de-scribe It is called slob-gol-lion an ap-pel-la-tion orig-i-nal with the whale-men and even so is the na-ture of the sub-stance It is an in-ef-fa-bly oozy stringy af-fair most fre-quent-ly found in the tubs of sperm after a pro-longed squeez-ing and sub-se-quent de-cant-ing I hold it to be the won-drous-ly thin rup-tured mem-branes of the case co-a-lesc-ing Gur-ry so called is a term prop-er-ly be-long-ing to right whale-men but some-times in-ci-den-tal-ly used by the sperm fish-er-men It des-ig-nates the dark gluti-nous sub-stance which is scraped off the back of the Green-land or right whale and much of which covers the decks of those in-fe-ri-or souls who hunt that ig-no-ble Le-viathan Nip-pers Strict-ly this word is not indige-nous to the whaleâ s vo-cab-u-lary But as ap-plied by whale-men it be-comes so A whale-manâ s nip-per is a short firm strip of tendi-nous stuff cut from the taper-ing part of Le-viathanâ s tail it aver-ages an inch in thick-ness and for the rest is about the size of the iron part of a hoe Edge-wise moved along the oi-ly deck it oper-ates like a leath-ern squil-gee and by name-less blan-dish-men-ts as of mag-ic al-lures along with it all im-pu-ri-ties But to learn all about th-ese re-con-dite mat-ters your best way is at once to descend in-to the blub-ber room and have a long talk with its in-mates This place has pre-vi-ous-ly been men-tioned as the re-cep-ta-cle for the blan-ket pieces when stript and hoist-ed from the whale When the prop-er time ar-rives for cut-ting up its con-tents this apart-ment is a scene of ter-ror to all ty-ros espe-cial-ly by night On one side lit by a dull lan-tern a space has been left clear for the work-men They gen-er-al-ly go in pairs â a pike and gaffman and a spade man The whal-ing pike is sim-i-lar to a fri-gateâ s board-ing weapon of the same name The gaff is some-thing like a boat hook With his gaff the gaffman hooks on to a sheet of blub-ber and strives to hold it from slip-ping as the ship pitch-es and lurch-es about Mean-while the spade man stands on the sheet it-self per-pen-dic-u-lar-ly chop-ping it in-to the portable horse pieces This spade is sharp as hone can make it the spade-manâ s feet are shoe-less the thing he stands on will some-times ir-re-sistibly slide away from him like a sledge If he cuts off one of his own toes or one of his as-sis-tantsâ would you be very much as-ton-ished Toes are scarce among veter-an blub-ber room men CHAPTER 95 The Cas-sock Had you stepped on board the Pe-quod at a cer-tain junc-ture of this post mortem-iz-ing of the whale and had you strolled for-ward nigh the wind-lass pret-ty sure am I that you would have scanned with no small cu-rios-i-ty a very strange enig-mat-i-cal ob-ject which you would have seen there ly-ing along length-wise in the lee scup-pers Not the won-drous cis-tern in the whaleâ s huge head not the prodi-gy of his un-hinged low-er jaw not the mir-a-cle of his sym-met-ri-cal tail none of th-ese would so sur-prise you as half a glimpse of that unac-count-able cone â longer than a Ken-tuck-ian is tall nigh a foot in di-am-e-ter at the base and jet black as Yo-jo the ebony idol of Quee-queg And an idol in-deed it is or rather in old times its like-ness was Such an idol as that found in the se-cret groves of Queen Maachah in Judea and for wor-ship-ping which King Asa her son did de-pose her and de-stroyed the idol and burnt it for an abom-i-na-tion at the brook Ke-dron as dark-ly set forth in the 15th chap-ter of the First Book of Kings Look at the sailor called the min-cer who now comes along and as-sist-ed by two al-lies heav-i-ly backs the gran-dis-simus as the mariners call it and with bowed shoul-ders stag-gers off with it as if he were a gre-nadier car-ry-ing a dead com-rade from the field Ex-tend-ing it upon the fore-cas-tle deck he now pro-ceeds cylin-dri-cal-ly to re-move its dark pelt as an African hunter the pelt of a boa This done he turns the pelt in-side out like a pan-taloon leg gives it a good stretch-ing so as al-most to dou-ble its di-am-e-ter and at last hangs it well spread in the rig-ging to dry Ere long it is tak-en down when re-mov-ing some three feet of it towards the point-ed ex-trem-i-ty and then cut-ting two sl-its for arm holes at the other end he length-wise slips him-self bodi-ly in-to it The min-cer now stands be-fore you in-vest-ed in the full canon-i-cals of his calling Im-memo-ri-al to all his order this in-vesti-ture alone will ad-e-quate-ly pro-tect him while em-ployed in the pe-cu-liar func-tions of his of-fice That of-fice con-sists in minc-ing the horse pieces of blub-ber for the pots an oper-a-tion which is con-duct-ed at a cu-ri-ous wood-en horse plant-ed end-wise against the bul-warks and with a ca-pa-cious tub be-neath it in-to which the minced pieces drop fast as the sheets from a rapt ora-torâ s desk Ar-rayed in de-cent black oc-cu-py-ing a con-spic-u-ous pul-pit in-tent on bi-ble leaves what a can-di-date for an arch-bish-opric what a lad for a Pope were this min-cer Bi-ble leaves Bi-ble leaves This is the in-vari-able cry from the mates to the min-cer It en-joins him to be care-ful and cut his work in-to as thin slices as pos-si-ble inas-much as by so do-ing the busi-ness of boil-ing out the oil is much ac-cel-er-at-ed and its quan-ti-ty con-sid-er-ably in-creased be-sides per-haps im-prov-ing it in qual-i-ty CHAPTER 96 The Try Works Be-sides her hoist-ed boats an Amer-i-can whaler is out-ward-ly distin-guished by her try works She pre-sen-ts the cu-ri-ous ano-ma-ly of the most sol-id ma-son-ry join-ing with oak and hemp in con-sti-tut-ing the com-plet-ed ship It is as if from the open field a brick kiln were trans-port-ed to her planks The try works are plant-ed between the fore-mast and main-mast the most roomy part of the deck The tim-bers be-neath are of a pe-cu-liar strength fit-ted to sus-tain the weight of an al-most sol-id mass of brick and mor-tar some ten feet by eight square and five in height The foun-da-tion does not pen-e-trate the deck but the ma-son-ry is firm-ly se-cured to the sur-face by pon-der-ous knees of iron brac-ing it on all sides and screw-ing it down to the tim-bers On the flanks it is cased with wood and at top com-plete-ly covered by a large slop-ing bat-tened hatch-way Re-mov-ing this hatch we ex-pose the great try pots two in num-ber and each of sev-er-al bar-rel-sâ ca-pac-i-ty When not in use they are kept re-mark-ably clean Some-times they are pol-ished with soap-stone and sand till they shine within like sil-ver punch bowls Dur-ing the night watch-es some cyn-i-cal old sailors will crawl in-to them and coil them-selves away there for a nap While em-ployed in pol-ish-ing themâ one man in each pot side by sideâ many con-fi-den-tial com-mu-ni-ca-tions are car-ried on over the iron lips It is a place al-so for pro-found math-e-mat-i-cal med-i-ta-tion It was in the left hand try pot of the Pe-quod with the soap-stone dili-gent-ly cir-cling round me that I was first indi-rect-ly struck by the re-mark-able fact that in geom-e-try all bodies glid-ing along the cy-cloid my soap-stone for ex-am-ple will descend from any point in pre-cise-ly the same time Re-mov-ing the fire board from the front of the try works the bare ma-son-ry of that side is ex-posed pen-e-trat-ed by the two iron mouths of the fur-naces direct-ly un-derneath the pots Th-ese mouths are fit-ted with heavy doors of iron The in-tense heat of the fire is prevent-ed from com-mu-ni-cat-ing it-self to the deck by means of a shal-low reser-voir ex-tend-ing un-der the en-tire in-closed sur-face of the works By a tun-nel insert-ed at the rear this reser-voir is kept re-plen-ished with water as fast as it eva-po-rates There are no ex-ter-nal chim-neys they open direct from the rear wall And here let us go back for a mo-ment It was about nine oâ clock at night that the Pe-quodâ s try works were first start-ed on this pre-sent voy-age It be-longed to Stubb to oversee the busi-ness â All ready there Off hatch then and start her You cook fire the works â This was an easy thing for the car-pen-ter had been thrust-ing his shav-ings in-to the fur-nace through-out the pas-sage Here be it said that in a whal-ing voy-age the first fire in the try works has to be fed for a time with wood After that no wood is used ex-cept as a means of quick ig-ni-tion to the sta-ple fuel In a word after be-ing tried out the crisp shriv-elled blub-ber now called scraps or frit-ters still con-tains con-sid-er-able of its unc-tu-ous prop-er-ties Th-ese frit-ters feed the flames Like a plethoric burn-ing mar-tyr or a self con-sum-ing misan-thrope once ig-nit-ed the whale sup-plies his own fuel and burns by his own body Would that he con-sumed his own smoke for his smoke is hor-ri-ble to in-hale and in-hale it you must and not on-ly that but you must live in it for the time It has an un-speak-able wild Hin-doo odor about it such as may lurk in the vicin-i-ty of fune-re-al pyres It smel-ls like the left wing of the day of judg-ment it is an ar-gu-ment for the pit By mid-night the works were in full oper-a-tion We were clear from the car-case sail had been made the wind was fresh-en-ing the wild ocean dark-ness was in-tense But that dark-ness was licked up by the fierce flames which at in-ter-vals forked forth from the sooty flues and il-lu-mi-nat-ed every lofty rope in the rig-ging as with the famed Greek fire The burn-ing ship drove on as if re-morse-less-ly com-mis-sioned to some venge-ful deed So the pitch and sul-phur freight-ed brigs of the bold Hy-dri-ote Ca-naris is-su-ing from their mid-night har-bors with broad sheets of flame for sails bore down upon the Turk-ish fri-gates and fold-ed them in con-fla-gra-tions The hatch re-moved from the top of the works now af-ford-ed a wide hearth in front of them Stand-ing on this were the Tartare-an shapes of the pa-gan har-pooneers al-ways the whale shipâ s stok-ers With huge pronged poles they pitched hiss-ing mass-es of blub-ber in-to the scald-ing pots or stirred up the fires be-neath till the snaky flames dart-ed curl-ing out of the doors to catch them by the feet The smoke rolled away in sullen heaps To every pitch of the ship there was a pitch of the boil-ing oil which seemed all eager-ness to leap in-to their faces Op-po-site the mouth of the works on the fur-ther side of the wide wood-en hearth was the wind-lass This served for a sea so-fa Here lounged the watch when not other-wise em-ployed look-ing in-to the red heat of the fire till their eyes felt scorched in their heads Their tawny fea-tures now all be-grimed with smoke and sweat their mat-ted beards and the con-trast-ing bar-bar-ic bril-lian-cy of their teeth all th-ese were strange-ly re-vealed in the capri-cious em-bla-zon-ings of the works As they nar-rat-ed to each other their un-holy ad-ven-tures their tales of ter-ror told in words of mirth as their un-civ-i-lized laugh-ter forked up-wards out of them like the flames from the fur-nace as to and fro in their front the har-pooneers wild-ly ges-tic-u-lat-ed with their huge pronged forks and dip-pers as the wind howled on and the sea leaped and the ship groaned and dived and yet stead-fast-ly shot her red hell fur-ther and fur-ther in-to the black-ness of the sea and the night and scorn-ful-ly champed the white bone in her mouth and vi-cious-ly spat round her on all sides then the rush-ing Pe-quod freight-ed with sav-ages and laden with fire and burn-ing a corpse and plung-ing in-to that black-ness of dark-ness seemed the ma-te-ri-al coun-ter-part of her mono-ma-ni-ac com-man-derâ s soul So seemed it to me as I stood at her helm and for long hours si-lent-ly guid-ed the way of this fire ship on the sea Wrapped for that in-ter-val in dark-ness my-self I but the bet-ter saw the red-ness the mad-ness the ghast-li-ness of others The con-tin-u-al sight of the fiend shapes be-fore me caper-ing half in smoke and half in fire th-ese at last be-gat kin-dred vi-sions in my soul so soon as I be-gan to yield to that unac-count-able drowsi-ness which ever would come over me at a mid-night helm But that night in par-tic-u-lar a strange and ever since in-ex-pli-ca-ble thing oc-curred to me Start-ing from a brief stand-ing sleep I was hor-ri-bly con-scious of some-thing fatal-ly wrong The jaw bone tiller smote my side which leaned against it in my ears was the low hum of sails just begin-ning to shake in the wind I thought my eyes were open I was half con-scious of put-ting my fingers to the lids and me-chan-i-cal-ly stretch-ing them still fur-ther apart But spite of all this I could see no com-pass be-fore me to steer by though it seemed but a minute since I had been watch-ing the card by the steady bin-na-cle lamp il-lu-mi-nat-ing it Noth-ing seemed be-fore me but a jet gloom now and then made ghast-ly by flash-es of red-ness Up-per-most was the im-pres-sion that what-ev-er swift rush-ing thing I stood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as rush-ing from all havens astern A stark bewil-dered feel-ing as of death came over me Con-vul-sive-ly my hands grasped the tiller but with the crazy con-ceit that the tiller was some-how in some en-chant-ed way in-vert-ed My God what is the mat-ter with me thought I Lo in my brief sleep I had turned my-self about and was fronting the shipâ s stern with my back to her prow and the com-pass In an in-stant I faced back just in time to prevent the ves-sel from fly-ing up in-to the wind and very prob-a-bly cap-siz-ing her How glad and how grate-ful the relief from this un-nat-u-ral hal-lu-ci-na-tion of the night and the fatal contin-gen-cy of be-ing brought by the lee Look not too long in the face of the fire O man Nev-er dream with thy hand on the helm Turn not thy back to the com-pass ac-cept the first hint of the hitch-ing tiller believe not the ar-ti-fi-cial fire when its red-ness makes all things look ghast-ly To mor-row in the nat-u-ral sun the skies will be bright those who glared like devils in the fork-ing flames the morn will show in far other at least gentler relief the glo-ri-ous gold-en glad sun the on-ly true lam-pâ all others but liars Nev-er-the-less the sun hides not Vir-gini-aâ s Dis-mal Swamp nor Romeâ s ac-cursed Cam-pagna nor wide Sa-hara nor all the mil-lions of miles of deserts and of griefs be-neath the moon The sun hides not the ocean which is the dark side of this earth and which is two thirds of this earth So there-fore that mor-tal man who hath more of joy than sor-row in him that mor-tal man can-not be trueâ not true or un-de-vel-oped With books the same The truest of all men was the Man of Sor-rows and the truest of all books is Solomonâ s and Ec-cle-si-astes is the fine ham-mered steel of woe â All is van-i-ty â ALL This wil-ful world hath not got hold of unchris-tian Solomonâ s wis-dom yet But he who dodges hospi-tals and jails and walks fast cross-ing grave-yards and would rather talk of operas than hell cal-ls Cow-per Young Pas-cal Rousseau poor devils all of sick men and through-out a care free life-time swears by Ra-belais as pass-ing wise and there-fore jol-ly â not that man is fit-ted to sit down on tomb stones and break the green damp mould with un-fath-omably won-drous Solomon But even Solomon he says â the man that wan-dereth out of the way of un-der-stand-ing shall re-mainâ i e even while liv-ing â in the con-gre-ga-tion of the dead â Give not thy-self up then to fire lest it in-vert thee dead-en thee as for the time it did me There is a wis-dom that is woe but there is a woe that is mad-ness And there is a Catskill ea-gle in some souls that can alike dive down in-to the black-est gorges and soar out of them again and be-come in-vis-i-ble in the sun-ny spaces And even if he for ever flies within the gorge that gorge is in the moun-tains so that even in his low-est swoop the moun-tain ea-gle is still higher than other birds upon the plain even though they soar CHAPTER 97 The Lamp Had you descend-ed from the Pe-quodâ s try works to the Pe-quodâ s fore-cas-tle where the off du-ty watch were sleep-ing for one sin-gle mo-ment you would have al-most thought you were stand-ing in some il-lu-mi-nat-ed shrine of can-on-ized kings and coun-sel-lors There they lay in their tri-an-gu-lar oak-en vaults each mariner a chis-elled mute-ness a score of lam-ps flash-ing upon his hood-ed eyes In mer-chant-men oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk of queens To dress in the dark and eat in the dark and stum-ble in dark-ness to his pal-let this is his usu-al lot But the whale-man as he seeks the food of light so he lives in light He makes his berth an Aladdinâ s lamp and lays him down in it so that in the pitchi-est night the shipâ s black hull still hous-es an il-lu-mi-na-tion See with what en-tire free-dom the whale-man takes his hand-ful of lamp-sâ often but old bot-tles and vials thoughâ to the cop-per cool-er at the try works and re-plen-ish-es them there as mugs of ale at a vat He burns too the purest of oil in its un-man-u-fac-tured and there-fore unvi-ti-at-ed state a flu-id un-known to so-lar lu-nar or as-tral con-trivances ashore It is sweet as ear-ly grass but-ter in April He goes and hun-ts for his oil so as to be sure of its fresh-ness and gen-uine-ness even as the trav-eller on the prair-ie hun-ts up his own sup-per of game CHAPTER 98 Stow-ing Down and Clear-ing Up Al-ready has it been re-lat-ed how the great le-viathan is afar off de-scried from the mast head how he is chased over the watery moors and slaugh-tered in the val-leys of the deep how he is then towed along-side and be-head-ed and how on the prin-ci-ple which en-ti-tled the heads-man of old to the gar-men-ts in which the be-head-ed was killed his great padded surtout be-comes the prop-er-ty of his ex-e-cu-tion-er how in due time he is con-demned to the pots and like Shadrach Me-shach and Abed-nego his sper-ma-ceti oil and bone pass un-scathed through the fire â but now it re-mains to con-clude the last chap-ter of this part of the de-scrip-tion by re-hears-ingâ sing-ing if I mayâ the ro-man-tic pro-ceed-ing of de-cant-ing off his oil in-to the casks and strik-ing them down in-to the hold where once again le-viathan re-turns to his na-tive pro-fun-di-ties slid-ing along be-neath the sur-face as be-fore but alas nev-er more to rise and blow While still warm the oil like hot punch is re-ceived in-to the six bar-rel casks and while per-haps the ship is pitch-ing and rolling this way and that in the mid-night sea the enor-mous casks are slewed round and head-ed over end for end and some-times per-ilous-ly scoot across the slip-pery deck like so many land slides till at last man han-dled and stayed in their course and all round the hoops rap rap go as many ham-mers as can play upon them for now ex of-fi-cio every sailor is a coop-er At length when the last pint is casked and all is cool then the great hatch-ways are unsealed the bow-els of the ship are thrown open and down go the casks to their fi-nal rest in the sea This done the hatch-es are re-placed and her-met-i-cal-ly closed like a clos-et walled up In the sperm fish-ery this is per-haps one of the most re-mark-able in-ci-den-ts in all the busi-ness of whal-ing One day the planks stream with freshets of blood and oil on the sa-cred quar-ter deck enor-mous mass-es of the whaleâ s head are pro-fane-ly piled great rusty casks lie about as in a brew-ery yard the smoke from the try works has be-soot-ed all the bul-warks the mariners go about suf-fused with unc-tu-ous-ness the en-tire ship seems great le-viathan him-self while on all hands the din is deafen-ing But a day or two after you look about you and prick your ears in this self same ship and were it not for the tell tale boats and try works you would all but swear you trod some si-lent mer-chant ves-sel with a most scrupu-lous-ly neat com-man-der The un-man-u-fac-tured sperm oil possess-es a sin-gu-lar-ly cleans-ing virtue This is the rea-son why the decks nev-er look so white as just after what they call an af-fair of oil Be-sides from the ash-es of the burned scraps of the whale a po-tent lye is read-i-ly made and when-ev-er any ad-he-sive-ness from the back of the whale re-mains cling-ing to the side that lye quick-ly ex-ter-mi-nates it Hands go dili-gent-ly along the bul-warks and with buck-ets of water and rags re-store them to their full tidi-ness The soot is brushed from the low-er rig-ging All the numer-ous im-ple-men-ts which have been in use are like-wise faith-ful-ly cleansed and put away The great hatch is scrubbed and placed upon the try works com-plete-ly hid-ing the pots every cask is out of sight all tack-les are coiled in unseen nooks and when by the com-bined and si-mul-ta-ne-ous in-dus-try of al-most the en-tire shipâ s com-pa-ny the whole of this con-sci-en-tious du-ty is at last con-clud-ed then the crew them-selves pro-ceed to their own ablu-tions shift them-selves from top to toe and fi-nal-ly is-sue to the im-mac-u-late deck fresh and all aglow as bride-grooms new leaped from out the dain-ti-est Hol-land Now with elat-ed step they pace the planks in twos and threes and hu-mor-ous-ly dis-course of par-lors so-fas car-pets and fine cam-brics pro-pose to mat the deck think of hav-ing hang-ing to the top ob-ject not to tak-ing tea by moon-light on the pi-az-za of the fore-cas-tle To hint to such musked mariners of oil and bone and blub-ber were lit-tle short of au-dac-i-ty They know not the thing you dis-tant-ly al-lude to Away and bring us nap-kins But mark aloft there at the three mast heads stand three men in-tent on spy-ing out more whales which if caught in-fal-li-bly will again soil the old oak-en fur-ni-ture and drop at least one small grease spot some-where Yes and many is the time when after the sever-est un-in-ter-rupt-ed labors which know no night con-tin-u-ing straight through for nine-ty six hours when from the boat where they have swelled their wrists with all day row-ing on the Line â they on-ly step to the deck to car-ry vast chains and heave the heavy wind-lass and cut and slash yea and in their very sweat-ings to be smoked and burned anew by the com-bined fires of the equa-to-ri-al sun and the equa-to-ri-al try works when on the heel of all this they have fi-nal-ly be-stirred them-selves to cleanse the ship and make a spot-less dairy room of it many is the time the poor fel-lows just but-ton-ing the necks of their clean frocks are star-tled by the cry of â There she blows â and away they fly to fight another whale and go through the whole weary thing again Oh my friends but this is man killing Yet this is life For hard-ly have we mor-tals by long toil-ings ex-tract-ed from this worldâ s vast bulk its small but valu-able sperm and then with weary pa-tience cleansed our-selves from its de-file-men-ts and learned to live here in clean taber-na-cles of the soul hard-ly is this done whenâ There she blows â the ghost is spout-ed up and away we sail to fight some other world and go through young lifeâ s old rou-tine again Oh the metempsy-chosis Oh Pythago-ras that in bright Greece two thou-sand years ago did die so good so wise so mild I sailed with thee along the Peru-vian coast last voy-ageâ and fool-ish as I am taught thee a green sim-ple boy how to splice a rope CHAPTER 99 The Dou-bloon Ere now it has been re-lat-ed how Ahab was wont to pace his quar-ter deck tak-ing reg-u-lar turns at either lim-it the bin-na-cle and main-mast but in the mul-ti-plic-i-ty of other things re-quir-ing nar-ra-tion it has not been added how that some-times in th-ese walks when most plunged in his mood he was wont to pause in turn at each spot and stand there strange-ly eye-ing the par-tic-u-lar ob-ject be-fore him When he halt-ed be-fore the bin-na-cle with his glance fas-tened on the point-ed nee-dle in the com-pass that glance shot like a javelin with the point-ed in-ten-si-ty of his pur-pose and when re-sum-ing his walk he again paused be-fore the main-mast then as the same rivet-ed glance fas-tened upon the rivet-ed gold coin there he still wore the same aspect of nailed firm-ness on-ly dashed with a cer-tain wild long-ing if not hope-ful-ness But one morn-ing turn-ing to pass the dou-bloon he seemed to be new-ly at-tract-ed by the strange fig-ures and in-scrip-tions stamped on it as though now for the first time begin-ning to in-ter-pret for him-self in some mono-ma-ni-ac way what-ev-er sig-nif-i-cance might lurk in them And some cer-tain sig-nif-i-cance lurks in all things else all things are lit-tle worth and the round world it-self but an emp-ty cipher ex-cept to sell by the cart-load as they do hil-ls about Bos-ton to fill up some mo-rass in the Milky Way Now this dou-bloon was of purest vir-gin gold raked some-where out of the heart of gor-geous hil-ls whence east and west over gold-en sands the head waters of many a Pac-to-lus flows And though now nailed amidst all the rusti-ness of iron bolts and the verdi-gris of cop-per spikes yet un-touch-able and im-mac-u-late to any foul-ness it still pre-served its Quito glow Nor though placed amongst a ruth-less crew and every hour passed by ruth-less hands and through the live-long nights shroud-ed with thick dark-ness which might cover any pil-fer-ing ap-proach nev-er-the-less every sun-rise found the dou-bloon where the sun-set left it last For it was set apart and sanc-ti-fied to one awe strik-ing end and how-ev-er wan-ton in their sailor ways one and all the mariners rev-ered it as the white whaleâ s tal-is-man Some-times they talked it over in the weary watch by night won-der-ing whose it was to be at last and whether he would ever live to spend it Now those noble gold-en coins of South Amer-i-ca are as medals of the sun and trop-ic to-ken pieces Here palms al-pacas and vol-ca-noes sunâ s disks and stars eclip-tics horns of plen-ty and rich ban-ners wav-ing are in lux-u-ri-ant pro-fu-sion stamped so that the pre-cious gold seems al-most to derive an added pre-cious-ness and en-hanc-ing glo-ries by pass-ing through those fan-cy min-ts so Span-ish-ly poet-ic It so chanced that the dou-bloon of the Pe-quod was a most wealthy ex-am-ple of th-ese things On its round border it bore the let-ters REPUBLICA DEL ECUADOR QUITO So this bright coin came from a coun-try plant-ed in the mid-dle of the world and be-neath the great equa-tor and named after it and it had been cast mid-way up the An-des in the un-wan-ing clime that knows no au-tumn Zoned by those let-ters you saw the like-ness of three An-desâ sum-mits from one a flame a tow-er on another on the third a crow-ing cock while arch-ing over all was a seg-ment of the par-ti-tioned zo-di-ac the signs all marked with their usu-al ca-bal-is-tics and the key-stone sun en-ter-ing the equinoc-tial point at Li-bra Be-fore this equa-to-ri-al coin Ahab not unob-served by others was now paus-ing â Thereâ s some-thing ever ego-tis-ti-cal in moun-tain tops and tow-ers and all other grand and lofty things look here â three peaks as proud as Lu-cifer The firm tow-er that is Ahab the vol-cano that is Ahab the coura-geous the un-daunt-ed and vic-to-ri-ous fowl that too is Ahab all are Ahab and this round gold is but the image of the rounder globe which like a ma-gi-cianâ s glass to each and every man in turn but mir-rors back his own mys-te-ri-ous self Great pains small gains for those who ask the world to solve them it can-not solve it-self Me-thinks now this coined sun wears a rud-dy face but see aye he en-ters the sign of stor-ms the equinox and but six months be-fore he wheeled out of a former equinox at Aries From storm to storm So be it then Born in throes â tis fit that man should live in pains and die in pangs So be it then Hereâ s stout stuff for woe to work on So be it then â â No fairy fingers can have pressed the gold but devilâ s claws must have left their mould-ings there since yes-ter-day â mur-mured Star-buck to him-self lean-ing against the bul-warks â The old man seems to read Bels-haz-zarâ s aw-ful writ-ing I have nev-er marked the coin in-spect-ing-ly He goes below let me read A dark val-ley between three mighty heav-en abid-ing peaks that al-most seem the Trin-i-ty in some faint earth-ly sym-bol So in this vale of Death God girds us round and over all our gloom the sun of Righ-teous-ness still shines a bea-con and a hope If we bend down our eyes the dark vale shows her mouldy soil but if we lift them the bright sun meets our glance half way to cheer Yet oh the great sun is no fix-ture and if at mid-night we would fain snatch some sweet so-lace from him we gaze for him in vain This coin speaks wise-ly mild-ly tru-ly but still sad-ly to me I will quit it lest Truth shake me false-ly â â There nowâ s the old Mogul â so-lil-o-quized Stubb by the try works â heâ s been twig-ging it and there goes Star-buck from the same and both with faces which I should say might be some-where within nine fath-oms long And all from look-ing at a piece of gold which did I have it now on Ne-gro Hill or in Cor-laerâ s Hook Iâ d not look at it very long ere spend-ing it Humph in my poor in-signif-i-cant opin-ion I re-gard this as queer I have seen dou-bloons be-fore now in my voy-ag-ings your dou-bloons of old Spain your dou-bloons of Peru your dou-bloons of Chili your dou-bloons of Bo-livia your dou-bloons of Po-payan with plen-ty of gold moidores and pis-toles and joes and half joes and quar-ter joes What then

hail-ing a ship show-ing English colours bear-ing down un-der the stern Trum-pet to mouth the old man was stand-ing in his hoist-ed quar-ter boat his ivory leg plain-ly re-vealed to the stranger cap-tain who was care-less-ly re-clin-ing in his own boatâ s bow He was a dark-ly tanned burly good na-tured fine look-ing man of six-ty or there-abouts dressed in a spa-cious round-about that hung round him in festoons of blue pilot cloth and one emp-ty arm of this jack-et streamed be-hind him like the broi-dered arm of a hus-sarâ s sur-coat â Hast seen the White Whale â â See you this â and with-draw-ing it from the folds that had hid-den it he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone ter-mi-nat-ing in a wood-en head like a mal-let â Man my boat â cried Ahab im-petu-ous-ly and toss-ing about the oars near himâ â Stand by to low-er â In less than a minute without quit-ting his lit-tle craft he and his crew were dropped to the water and were soon along-side of the stranger But here a cu-ri-ous dif-fi-cul-ty pre-sent-ed it-self In the ex-cite-ment of the mo-ment Ahab had for-got-ten that since the loss of his leg he had nev-er once stepped on board of any ves-sel at sea but his own and then it was al-ways by an in-ge-nious and very handy me-chan-i-cal con-trivance pe-cu-liar to the Pe-quod and a thing not to be rigged and shipped in any other ves-sel at a mo-men-tâ s warn-ing Now it is no very easy mat-ter for any-bodyâ ex-cept those who are al-most hourly used to it like whale-menâ to clam-ber up a shipâ s side from a boat on the open sea for the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bul-warks and then in-stan-ta-neous-ly drop it half way down to the kel-son So deprived of one leg and the strange ship of course be-ing al-to-geth-er un-sup-plied with the kind-ly in-ven-tion Ahab now found him-self ab-ject-ly re-duced to a clum-sy lands-man again hope-less-ly eye-ing the uncer-tain change-ful height he could hard-ly hope to at-tain It has be-fore been hint-ed per-haps that every lit-tle un-to-ward cir-cum-stance that be-fell him and which indi-rect-ly sprang from his luck-less mishap al-most in-vari-ably ir-ri-tat-ed or ex-as-per-at-ed Ahab And in the pre-sent in-stance all this was height-ened by the sight of the two of-fi-cers of the strange ship lean-ing over the side by the per-pen-dic-u-lar lad-der of nailed cleets there and swing-ing towards him a pair of taste-ful-ly or-na-ment-ed man ropes for at first they did not seem to be-think them that a one legged man must be too much of a crip-ple to use their sea ban-nis-ters But this awk-ward-ness on-ly last-ed a minute be-cause the strange cap-tain ob-serv-ing at a glance how af-fairs stood cried out â I see I see â avast heav-ing there Jump boys and swing over the cut-ting tack-le â As good luck would have it they had had a whale along-side a day or two pre-vi-ous and the great tack-les were still aloft and the mas-sive curved blub-ber hook now clean and dry was still at-tached to the end This was quick-ly low-ered to Ahab who at once com-pre-hend-ing it all slid his soli-tary thigh in-to the curve of the hook it was like sit-ting in the fluke of an an-chor or the crotch of an ap-ple tree and then giv-ing the word held him-self fast and at the same time al-so helped to hoist his own weight by pulling hand over hand upon one of the run-ning parts of the tack-le Soon he was care-ful-ly swung in-side the high bul-warks and gent-ly land-ed upon the cap-stan head With his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in wel-come the other cap-tain ad-vanced and Ahab put-ting out his ivory leg and cross-ing the ivory arm like two sword fish blades cried out in his wal-rus way â Aye aye hearty let us shake bones to-geth-er â an arm and a leg â an arm that nev-er can shrink dâ ye see and a leg that nev-er can run Where didâ st thou see the White Whale â how long ago â â The White Whale â said the English-man point-ing his ivory arm towards the East and tak-ing a rue-ful sight along it as if it had been a te-le-scope â there I saw him on the Line last sea-son â â And he took that arm off did he â asked Ahab now slid-ing down from the cap-stan and rest-ing on the English-manâ s shoul-der as he did so â Aye he was the cause of it at least and that leg too â â Spin me the yarn â said Ahab â how was it â â It was the first time in my life that I ever cruised on the Line â be-gan the English-man â I was ig-no-rant of the White Whale at that time Well one day we low-ered for a pod of four or five whales and my boat fas-tened to one of them a reg-u-lar cir-cus horse he was too that went milling and milling round so that my boatâ s crew could on-ly trim dish by sit-ting all their sterns on the outer gun-wale Present-ly up breach-es from the bot-tom of the sea a bounc-ing great whale with a milky white head and hump all crowsâ feet and wrin-kles â â It was he it was he â cried Ahab sud-den-ly let-ting out his sus-pend-ed breath â And har-poons stick-ing in near his star-board fin â â Aye ayeâ they were mineâ my irons â cried Ahab ex-ult-ing-lyâ â but on â â Give me a chance then â said the English-man good hu-mored-ly â Well this old great grand-fa-ther with the white head and hump runs all afoam in-to the pod and goes to snap-ping fu-ri-ous-ly at my fast line â Aye I see â want-ed to part it free the fast fishâ an old trickâ I know him â â How it was ex-act-ly â con-tin-ued the one armed com-man-der â I do not know but in bit-ing the line it got foul of his teeth caught there some-how but we did-nâ t know it then so that when we after-wards pulled on the line bounce we came plump on to his hump in-stead of the other whaleâ s that went off to wind-ward all fluk-ing See-ing how mat-ters stood and what a noble great whale it wasâ the noblest and biggest I ever saw sir in my lifeâ I re-solved to cap-ture him spite of the boil-ing rage he seemed to be in And think-ing the hap hazard line would get loose or the tooth it was tan-gled to might draw for I have a devil of a boatâ s crew for a pull on a whale line see-ing all this I say I jumped in-to my first mateâ s boatâ Mr Mount-topâ s here by the way Cap-tainâ Mount-top Mount-topâ the cap-tain â as I was say-ing I jumped in-to Mount-topâ s boat which dâ ye see was gun-wale and gun-wale with mine then and snatch-ing the first har-poon let this old great grand-fa-ther have it But Lord look you sirâ hearts and souls alive manâ the next in-stant in a jiff I was blind as a batâ both eyes outâ all be-fogged and bedead-ened with black foamâ the whaleâ s tail loom-ing straight up out of it per-pen-dic-u-lar in the air like a mar-ble steeple No use stern-ing all then but as I was grop-ing at mid-day with a blind-ing sun all crown jewels as I was grop-ing I say after the se-cond iron to toss it over-boardâ down comes the tail like a Li-ma tow-er cut-ting my boat in two leav-ing each half in splin-ters and flukes first the white hump backed through the wreck as though it was all chips We all struck out To es-cape his ter-ri-ble flail-ings I seized hold of my har-poon pole stick-ing in him and for a mo-ment clung to that like a suck-ing fish But a comb-ing sea dashed me off and at the same in-stant the fish tak-ing one good dart for-wards went down like a flash and the barb of that cursed se-cond iron tow-ing along near me caught me hereâ clap-ping his hand just below his shoul-der â yes caught me just here I say and bore me down to Hel-lâ s flames I was think-ing when when all of a sud-den thank the good God the barb ript its way along the fleshâ clear along the whole length of my ar-mâ came out nigh my wrist and up I float-ed â and that gentle-man there will tell you the rest by the way cap-tainâ Dr Bunger shipâ s sur-geon Bunger my lad â the cap-tain Now Bunger boy spin your part of the yarn â The pro-fes-sion-al gentle-man thus fa-mil-iar-ly point-ed out had been all the time stand-ing near them with noth-ing spe-cif-ic vis-i-ble to denote his gentle-man-ly rank on board His face was an ex-ceed-ing-ly round but sober one he was dressed in a fad-ed blue woollen frock or shirt and patched trowsers and had thus far been di-vid-ing his at-ten-tion between a mar-lingspike he held in one hand and a pill box held in the other oc-ca-sion-al-ly cast-ing a crit-i-cal glance at the ivory lim-bs of the two crip-pled cap-tains But at his su-pe-ri-orâ s in-tro-duc-tion of him to Ahab he po-lite-ly bowed and straight-way went on to do his cap-tainâ s bid-ding â It was a shock-ing bad wound â be-gan the whale sur-geon â and tak-ing my ad-vice Cap-tain Boomer here stood our old Sam-myâ â â Sa-muel En-der-by is the name of my ship â in-ter-rupt-ed the one armed cap-tain ad-dress-ing Ahab â go on boy â â Stood our old Sam-my off to the north-ward to get out of the blaz-ing hot weather there on the Line But it was no useâ I did all I could sat up with him nights was very se-vere with him in the mat-ter of di-etâ â â Oh very se-vere â chimed in the pa-tient him-self then sud-den-ly al-ter-ing his voice â Drink-ing hot rum tod-dies with me every night till he could-nâ t see to put on the bandages and send-ing me to bed half seas over about three oâ clock in the morn-ing Oh ye stars he sat up with me in-deed and was very se-vere in my di-et Oh a great watch-er and very di-etet-i-cal-ly se-vere is Dr Bunger Bunger you dog laugh out why donâ t ye You know youâ re a pre-cious jol-ly ras-cal But heave ahead boy Iâ d rather be killed by you than kept alive by any other man â â My cap-tain you must have ere this per-ceived re-spect-ed sirâ â said the im-per-turbable god-ly look-ing Bunger slight-ly bow-ing to Ahabâ â is apt to be face-tious at times he spins us many clever things of that sort But I may as well sayâ en pas-sant as the French re-markâ that I my-selfâ that is to say Jack Bunger late of the rev-erend cler-gyâ am a strict to-tal ab-sti-nence man I nev-er drinkâ â â Water â cried the cap-tain â he nev-er drinks it itâ s a sort of fits to him fresh water throws him in-to the hy-dropho-bia but go onâ go on with the arm sto-ry â â Yes I may as well â said the sur-geon cool-ly â I was about ob-serv-ing sir be-fore Cap-tain Boomerâ s face-tious in-ter-rup-tion that spite of my best and sever-est en-deav-ors the wound kept get-ting worse and worse the truth was sir it was as ug-ly gap-ing wound as sur-geon ever saw more than two feet and sev-er-al inch-es long I mea-sured it with the lead line In short it grew black I knew what was threat-ened and off it came But I had no hand in ship-ping that ivory arm there that thing is against all ruleâ â point-ing at it with the mar-lingspikeâ â that is the cap-tainâ s work not mine he ordered the car-pen-ter to make it he had that club ham-mer there put to the end to knock some oneâ s brains out with I sup-pose as he tried mine once He flies in-to di-abol-i-cal pas-sions some-times Do ye see this dent sirâ â re-mov-ing his hat and brush-ing aside his hair and ex-pos-ing a bowl like cav-i-ty in his skull but which bore not the slight-est scar-ry trace or any to-ken of ever hav-ing been a woundâ â Well the cap-tain there will tell you how that came here he knows â â No I donâ t â said the cap-tain â but his mother did he was born with it Oh you solemn rogue youâ you Bunger was there ever such another Bunger in the watery world Bunger when you die you ought to die in pick-le you dog you should be pre-served to fu-ture ages you ras-cal â â What be-came of the White Whale â now cried Ahab who thus far had been im-pa-tient-ly lis-ten-ing to this by play between the two English-men â Oh â cried the one armed cap-tain â oh yes Well after he sound-ed we did-nâ t see him again for some time in fact as I be-fore hint-ed I did-nâ t then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick till some time after-wards when com-ing back to the Line we heard about Mo-by Dickâ as some call himâ and then I knew it was he â â Didâ st thou cross his wake again â â Twice â â But could not fas-ten â â Did-nâ t want to try to ainâ t one limb enough What should I do without this other arm And Iâ m think-ing Mo-by Dick does-nâ t bite so much as he swal-lows â â Well then â in-ter-rupt-ed Bunger â give him your left arm for bait to get the right Do you know gentle-menâ â very grave-ly and math-e-mat-i-cal-ly bow-ing to each Cap-tain in suc-ces-sionâ â Do you know gentle-men that the diges-tive or-gans of the whale are so in-scrutably con-struct-ed by Divine Prov-i-dence that it is quite im-pos-si-ble for him to com-plete-ly digest even a manâ s arm And he knows it too So that what you take for the White Whaleâ s mal-ice is on-ly his awk-ward-ness For he nev-er means to swal-low a sin-gle limb he on-ly thinks to ter-ri-fy by fein-ts But some-times he is like the old jug-gling fel-low former-ly a pa-tient of mine in Cey-lon that mak-ing believe swal-low jack knives once upon a time let one drop in-to him in good earnest and there it stayed for a twelve-month or more when I gave him an emet-ic and he heaved it up in small tacks dâ ye see No pos-si-ble way for him to digest that jack knife and ful-ly in-cor-po-rate it in-to his gen-er-al bodi-ly sys-tem Yes Cap-tain Boomer if you are quick enough about it and have a mind to pawn one arm for the sake of the priv-i-lege of giv-ing de-cent buri-al to the other why in that case the arm is yours on-ly let the whale have another chance at you short-ly thatâ s all â â No thank ye Bunger â said the English Cap-tain â heâ s wel-come to the arm he has since I canâ t help it and did-nâ t know him then but not to another one No more White Whales for me Iâ ve low-ered for him once and that has sat-is-fied me There would be great glo-ry in killing him I know that and there is a ship load of pre-cious sperm in him but hark ye heâ s best let alone donâ t you think so Cap-tain â â glanc-ing at the ivory leg â He is But he will still be hunt-ed for all that What is best let alone that ac-cursed thing is not al-ways what least al-lures Heâ s all a mag-net How long since thou sawâ st him last Which way head-ing â â Bless my soul and curse the foul fiendâ s â cried Bunger stoop-ing-ly walk-ing round Ahab and like a dog strange-ly snuff-ing â this manâ s bloodâ bring the ther-mome-ter â itâ s at the boil-ing point â his pulse makes th-ese planks beat â sir â â tak-ing a lancet from his pock-et and draw-ing near to Ahabâ s arm â Avast â roared Ahab dash-ing him against the bul-wark-sâ â Man the boat Which way head-ing â â Good God â cried the English Cap-tain to whom the ques-tion was put â Whatâ s the mat-ter He was head-ing east I think â Is your Cap-tain crazy â whis-per-ing Fedal-lah But Fedal-lah put-ting a finger on his lip slid over the bul-warks to take the boatâ s steer-ing oar and Ahab swing-ing the cut-ting tack-le towards him com-mand-ed the shipâ s sailors to stand by to low-er In a mo-ment he was stand-ing in the boatâ s stern and the Manil-la men were spring-ing to their oars In vain the English Cap-tain hailed him With back to the stranger ship and face set like a flint to his own Ahab stood upright till along-side of the Pe-quod CHAPTER 11 The De-can-ter Ere the English ship fades from sight be it set down here that she hailed from Lon-don and was named after the late Sa-muel En-der-by mer-chant of that ci-ty the orig-i-nal of the fa-mous whal-ing house of En-der-by Sons a house which in my poor whale-manâ s opin-ion comes not far be-hind the unit-ed roy-al hous-es of the Tu-dors and Bour-bons in point of real his-tor-i-cal in-ter-est How long pri-or to the year of our Lord 1775 this great whal-ing house was in ex-is-tence my numer-ous fish doc-u-men-ts do not make plain but in that year 1775 it fit-ted out the first English ships that ever reg-u-lar-ly hunt-ed the Sperm Whale though for some score of years pre-vi-ous ever since 1726 our valiant Coffins and Maceys of Nan-tuck-et and the Vine-yard had in large fleets pur-sued that Le-viathan but on-ly in the North and South At-lantic not else-where Be it distinct-ly record-ed here that the Nan-tuck-eters were the first among mankind to har-poon with civ-i-lized steel the great Sperm Whale and that for half a cen-tu-ry they were the on-ly peo-ple of the whole globe who so har-pooned him In 1778 a fine ship the Amelia fit-ted out for the ex-press pur-pose and at the sole charge of the vig-or-ous En-der-bys bold-ly round-ed Cape Horn and was the first among the na-tions to low-er a whale boat of any sort in the great South Sea The voy-age was a sk-il-ful and lucky one and re-turn-ing to her berth with her hold full of the pre-cious sperm the Ameli-aâ s ex-am-ple was soon fol-lowed by other ships English and Amer-i-can and thus the vast Sperm Whale grounds of the Pa-cif-ic were thrown open But not con-tent with this good deed the in-de-fati-ga-ble house again be-stirred it-self Sa-muel and all his Son-sâ how many their mother on-ly knowsâ and un-der their im-me-di-ate aus-pices and part-ly I think at their ex-pense the Bri-tish govern-ment was in-duced to send the sloop of war Rat-tler on a whal-ing voy-age of dis-cov-ery in-to the South Sea Com-mand-ed by a naval Post Cap-tain the Rat-tler made a rat-tling voy-age of it and did some ser-vice how much does not ap-pear But this is not all In 1819 the same house fit-ted out a dis-cov-ery whale ship of their own to go on a tast-ing cruise to the re-mote waters of Ja-pan That shipâ well called the â Syrenâ â made a noble ex-per-i-men-tal cruise and it was thus that the great Ja-panese Whal-ing Ground first be-came gen-er-al-ly known The Syren in this fa-mous voy-age was com-mand-ed by a Cap-tain Cof-fin a Nan-tuck-eter All honor to the En-der-bies there-fore whose house I think ex-ists to the pre-sent day though doubt-less the orig-i-nal Sa-muel must long ago have slipped his cable for the great South Sea of the other world The ship named after him was wor-thy of the honor be-ing a very fast sail-er and a noble craft every way I board-ed her once at mid-night some-where off the Patag-o-ni-an coast and drank good flip down in the fore-cas-tle It was a fine gam we had and they were all trump-sâ every soul on board A short life to them and a jol-ly death And that fine gam I hadâ long very long after old Ahab touched her planks with his ivory heelâ it minds me of the noble sol-id Sax-on hospi-tal-i-ty of that ship and may my par-son for-get me and the devil re-mem-ber me if I ever lose sight of it Flip Did I say we had flip Yes and we flipped it at the rate of ten gal-lons the hour and when the squall came for itâ s squal-ly off there by Patag-o-nia and all hand-sâ visi-tors and al-lâ were called to reef top-sails we were so top heavy that we had to swing each other aloft in bow-lines and we ig-no-rant-ly furled the skirts of our jack-ets in-to the sails so that we hung there reefed fast in the howl-ing gale a warn-ing ex-am-ple to all drunk-en tars How-ev-er the masts did not go over-board and by and by we scram-bled down so sober that we had to pass the flip again though the sav-age salt spray burst-ing down the fore-cas-tle scut-tle rather too much di-lut-ed and pick-led it to my taste The beef was fineâ tough but with body in it They said it was bull beef others that it was dromedary beef but I do not know for cer-tain how that was They had dumplings too small but sub-stan-tial sym-met-ri-cal-ly glob-u-lar and in-de-struc-tible dumplings I fan-cied that you could feel them and roll them about in you after they were swal-lowed If you stooped over too far for-ward you risked their pitch-ing out of you like bil-liard bal-ls The breadâ but that could-nâ t be helped be-sides it was an an-ti scor-bu-tic in short the bread con-tained the on-ly fresh fare they had But the fore-cas-tle was not very light and it was very easy to step over in-to a dark corner when you ate it But all in all tak-ing her from truck to helm con-sid-er-ing the di-men-sions of the cookâ s boil-ers in-clud-ing his own live parch-ment boil-ers fore and aft I say the Sa-muel En-der-by was a jol-ly ship of good fare and plen-ty fine flip and strong crack fel-lows all and cap-i-tal from boot heels to hat band But why was it think ye that the Sa-muel En-der-by and some other English whalers I know ofâ not all thoughâ were such fa-mous hospitable ships that passed round the beef and the bread and the can and the joke and were not soon weary of eat-ing and drink-ing and laugh-ing I will tell you The abound-ing good cheer of th-ese English whalers is mat-ter for his-tor-i-cal re-search Nor have I been at all spar-ing of his-tor-i-cal whale re-search when it has seemed need-ed The English were pre-ced-ed in the whale fish-ery by the Hol-lan-ders Zealan-ders and Danes from whom they derived many ter-ms still ex-tant in the fish-ery and what is yet more their fat old fash-ions touch-ing plen-ty to eat and drink For as a gen-er-al thing the English mer-chant ship scrim-ps her crew but not so the English whaler Hence in the English this thing of whal-ing good cheer is not nor-mal and nat-u-ral but in-ci-den-tal and par-tic-u-lar and there-fore must have some spe-cial ori-gin which is here point-ed out and will be still fur-ther elu-ci-dat-ed Dur-ing my re-search-es in the Le-viathanic his-to-ries I stum-bled upon an an-cient Dutch vol-ume which by the musty whal-ing smell of it I knew must be about whalers The ti-tle was â Dan Coop-man â where-fore I con-clud-ed that this must be the in-valu-able me-moirs of some Am-s-ter-dam coop-er in the fish-ery as every whale ship must car-ry its coop-er I was re-in-forced in this opin-ion by see-ing that it was the pro-duc-tion of one â Fitz Swack-ham-mer â But my friend Dr Sn-od-head a very learned man pro-fes-sor of Low Dutch and High Ger-man in the col-lege of San-ta Claus and St Pot-tâ s to whom I hand-ed the work for trans-la-tion giv-ing him a box of sperm can-dles for his trou-bleâ this same Dr Sn-od-head so soon as he spied the book as-sured me that â Dan Coop-manâ did not mean â The Coop-er â but â The Mer-chant â In short this an-cient and learned Low Dutch book treat-ed of the com-merce of Hol-land and among other sub-jec-ts con-tained a very in-ter-est-ing ac-count of its whale fish-ery And in this chap-ter it was head-ed â Smeer â or â Fat â that I found a long de-tailed list of the out-fits for the larders and cel-lars of 18 sail of Dutch whale-men from which list as trans-lat-ed by Dr Sn-od-head I tran-scribe the fol-low-ing 4  lbs of beef 6  lbs Fries-land pork 15  lbs of stock fish 55  lbs of bis-cuit 72  lbs of soft bread 2 8 firkins of but-ter 2  lbs Tex-el Ley-den cheese 144  lbs cheese prob-a-bly an in-fe-ri-or ar-ti-cle 55 ankers of Gene-va 1 8 bar-rels of beer Most sta-tis-ti-cal tables are parch-ing-ly dry in the read-ing not so in the pre-sent case how-ev-er where the read-er is flood-ed with whole pipes bar-rels quar-ts and gil-ls of good gin and good cheer At the time I devot-ed three days to the stu-dious digest-ing of all this beer beef and bread dur-ing which many pro-found thoughts were in-ci-den-tal-ly suggest-ed to me ca-pable of a tran-scen-den-tal and Pla-ton-ic ap-pli-ca-tion and fur-ther-more I com-piled sup-ple-men-tary tables of my own touch-ing the prob-a-ble quan-ti-ty of stock fish etc con-sumed by every Low Dutch har-pooneer in that an-cient Green-land and Spitzber-gen whale fish-ery In the first place the amount of but-ter and Tex-el and Ley-den cheese con-sumed seems amaz-ing I im-pute it though to their nat-u-ral-ly unc-tu-ous na-tures be-ing ren-dered still more unc-tu-ous by the na-ture of their vo-ca-tion and espe-cial-ly by their pur-su-ing their game in those frigid Po-lar Seas on the very coasts of that Esquimaux coun-try where the con-vivial na-tives pledge each other in bumpers of train oil The quan-ti-ty of beer too is very large 1 8 bar-rels Now as those po-lar fish-eries could on-ly be prose-cut-ed in the short sum-mer of that cli-mate so that the whole cruise of one of th-ese Dutch whale-men in-clud-ing the short voy-age to and from the Spitzber-gen sea did not much ex-ceed three months say and reck-on-ing 3 men to each of their fleet of 18 sail we have 5 4 Low Dutch sea-men in all there-fore I say we have pre-cise-ly two bar-rels of beer per man for a twelve week-sâ al-lowance ex-clu-sive of his fair pro-por-tion of that 55 ankers of gin Now whether th-ese gin and beer har-pooneers so fud-dled as one might fan-cy them to have been were the right sort of men to stand up in a boatâ s head and take good aim at fly-ing whales this would seem some-what im-prob-a-ble Yet they did aim at them and hit them too But this was very far North be it re-mem-bered where beer agrees well with the con-sti-tu-tion upon the Equa-tor in our south-ern fish-ery beer would be apt to make the har-pooneer sleepy at the mast head and boozy in his boat and grievous loss might en-sue to Nan-tuck-et and New Bed-ford But no more enough has been said to show that the old Dutch whalers of two or three cen-turies ago were high livers and that the English whalers have not ne-glect-ed so ex-cel-lent an ex-am-ple For say they when cruis-ing in an emp-ty ship if you can get noth-ing bet-ter out of the world get a good din-ner out of it at least And this emp-ties the de-can-ter CHAPTER 12 A Bow-er in the Ar-sacides Hither-to in de-scrip-tive-ly treat-ing of the Sperm Whale I have chiefly dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect or separate-ly and in de-tail upon some few in-te-ri-or struc-tural fea-tures But to a large and thor-ough sweep-ing com-pre-hen-sion of him it be-hooves me now to un-but-ton him still fur-ther and un-tag-ging the poin-ts of his hose un-buck-ling his garters and cast-ing loose the hooks and the eyes of the join-ts of his in-ner-most bones set him be-fore you in his ul-ti-ma-tum that is to say in his un-con-di-tion-al skele-ton But how now Ish-mael How is it that you a mere oars-man in the fish-ery pre-tend to know aught about the subter-ranean parts of the whale Did eru-dite Stubb mount-ed upon your cap-stan de-liv-er lec-tures on the anato-my of the Ce-tacea and by help of the wind-lass hold up a spec-i-men rib for ex-hi-bi-tion Ex-plain thy-self Ish-mael Can you land a full grown whale on your deck for ex-am-i-na-tion as a cook dish-es a roast pig Sure-ly not A ver-i-ta-ble wit-ness have you hither-to been Ish-mael but have a care how you seize the priv-i-lege of Jon-ah alone the priv-i-lege of dis-cours-ing upon the joists and beams the rafters ridge pole sleep-ers and un-der pin-nings mak-ing up the frame work of le-viathan and be-like of the tal-low vats dairy rooms but-ter-ies and cheeseries in his bow-els I con-fess that since Jon-ah few whale-men have pen-e-trat-ed very far be-neath the skin of the adult whale nev-er-the-less I have been blessed with an op-por-tu-ni-ty to dis-sect him in minia-ture In a ship I be-longed to a small cub Sperm Whale was once bodi-ly hoist-ed to the deck for his poke or bag to make sheaths for the bar-bs of the har-poons and for the heads of the lances Think you I let that chance go without us-ing my boat hatch-et and jack knife and break-ing the seal and read-ing all the con-tents of that young cub And as for my ex-act knowl-edge of the bones of the le-viathan in their gi-gan-tic full grown devel-op-ment for that rare knowl-edge I am in-debt-ed to my late roy-al friend Tran-quo king of Tranque one of the Ar-sacides For be-ing at Tranque years ago when at-tached to the trad-ing ship Dey of Al-giers I was in-vit-ed to spend part of the Ar-sacidean hol-i-days with the lord of Tranque at his re-tired palm vil-la at Pu-pel-la a sea side glen not very far dis-tant from what our sailors called Bam-boo Town his cap-i-tal Among many other fine qual-i-ties my roy-al friend Tran-quo be-ing gift-ed with a devout love for all mat-ters of bar-bar-ic ver-tu had brought to-geth-er in Pu-pel-la what-ev-er rare things the more in-ge-nious of his peo-ple could in-vent chiefly carved woods of won-der-ful de-vices chis-elled shel-ls in-laid spears cost-ly pad-dles aro-mat-ic ca-noes and all th-ese distribut-ed among what-ev-er nat-u-ral won-ders the won-der freight-ed tribute ren-der-ing waves had cast upon his shores Chief among th-ese lat-ter was a great Sperm Whale which after an unusu-al-ly long rag-ing gale had been found dead and strand-ed with his head against a co-coa nut tree whose plumage like tuft-ed droop-ings seemed his ver-dant jet When the vast body had at last been stripped of its fath-om deep en-fold-ings and the bones be-come dust dry in the sun then the skele-ton was care-ful-ly trans-port-ed up the Pu-pel-la glen where a grand tem-ple of lord-ly palms now shel-tered it The ribs were hung with tro-phies the ver-te-brÃ were carved with Ar-sacidean an-nals in strange hiero-glyph-ics in the skull the pri-ests kept up an unex-tin-guished aro-mat-ic flame so that the mys-tic head again sent forth its va-pory spout while sus-pend-ed from a bough the ter-rif-ic low-er jaw vi-brat-ed over all the devo-tees like the hair hung sword that so af-fright-ed Damo-cles It was a won-drous sight The wood was green as moss-es of the Icy Glen the trees stood high and haughty feel-ing their liv-ing sap the in-dus-tri-ous earth be-neath was as a weaverâ s loom with a gor-geous car-pet on it where-of the ground vine ten-drils formed the warp and woof and the liv-ing flow-ers the fig-ures All the trees with all their laden branch-es all the shrubs and ferns and grass-es the mes-sage car-ry-ing air all th-ese unceas-ing-ly were ac-tive Through the lac-ings of the leaves the great sun seemed a fly-ing shut-tle weav-ing the un-wea-ried ver-dure Oh busy weaver unseen weaver â pause â one word â whith-er flows the fabric what palace may it deck where-fore all th-ese cease-less toil-ings Speak weaver â stay thy hand â but one sin-gle word with thee Nayâ the shut-tle fliesâ the fig-ures float from forth the loom the freshet rush-ing car-pet for ever slides away The weaver god he weaves and by that weav-ing is he deafened that he hears no mor-tal voice and by that hum-ming we too who look on the loom are deafened and on-ly when we es-cape it shall we hear the thou-sand voic-es that speak through it For even so it is in all ma-te-ri-al fac-to-ries The spo-ken words that are inaudi-ble among the fly-ing spin-dles those same words are plain-ly heard without the wal-ls burst-ing from the opened case-men-ts There-by have vil-lainies been de-tect-ed Ah mor-tal then be heed-ful for so in all this din of the great worldâ s loom thy subtlest think-ings may be over-heard afar Now amid the green life rest-less loom of that Ar-sacidean wood the great white wor-shipped skele-ton lay loung-ingâ a gi-gan-tic idler Yet as the ever woven ver-dant warp and woof in-ter-mixed and hummed around him the mighty idler seemed the cun-ning weaver him-self all woven over with the vines every month as-sum-ing green-er fresh-er ver-dure but him-self a skele-ton Life fold-ed Death Death trel-lised Life the grim god wived with youth-ful Life and be-gat him curly head-ed glo-ries Now when with roy-al Tran-quo I visit-ed this won-drous whale and saw the skull an al-tar and the ar-ti-fi-cial smoke as-cend-ing from where the real jet had is-sued I marvelled that the king should re-gard a chapel as an ob-ject of ver-tu He laughed But more I marvelled that the pri-ests should swear that smoky jet of his was gen-uine To and fro I paced be-fore this skele-tonâ brushed the vines asideâ broke through the rib-sâ and with a ball of Ar-sacidean twine wan-dered ed-died long amid its many wind-ing shad-ed colon-nades and ar-bours But soon my line was out and fol-low-ing it back I emerged from the open-ing where I en-tered I saw no liv-ing thing within naught was there but bones Cut-ting me a green mea-sur-ing rod I once more dived within the skele-ton From their ar-row slit in the skull the pri-ests per-ceived me tak-ing the alti-tude of the fi-nal rib â How now â they shout-ed â Darâ st thou mea-sure this our god Thatâ s for us â â Aye pri-est-sâ well how long do ye make him then â But here-upon a fierce con-test rose among them con-cern-ing feet and inch-es they cracked each otherâ s sconces with their yard stick-sâ the great skull echoedâ and seiz-ing that lucky chance I quick-ly con-clud-ed my own ad-mea-sure-men-ts Th-ese ad-mea-sure-men-ts I now pro-pose to set be-fore you But first be it record-ed that in this mat-ter I am not free to ut-ter any fan-cied mea-sure-ment I please Be-cause there are skele-ton author-i-ties you can re-fer to to test my ac-cu-ra-cy There is a Le-viathanic Mu-se-um they tell me in Hull Eng-land one of the whal-ing ports of that coun-try where they have some fine spec-i-mens of fin backs and other whales Like-wise I have heard that in the mu-se-um of Manch-ester in New Hamp-shire they have what the pro-pri-etors call â the on-ly per-fect spec-i-men of a Green-land or Riv-er Whale in the Unit-ed States â More-over at a place in York-shire Eng-land Bur-ton Con-sta-ble by name a cer-tain Sir Clif-ford Con-sta-ble has in his posses-sion the skele-ton of a Sperm Whale but of moder-ate size by no means of the full grown mag-ni-tude of my friend King Tran-quoâ s In both cas-es the strand-ed whales to which th-ese two skele-tons be-longed were orig-i-nal-ly claimed by their pro-pri-etors upon sim-i-lar grounds King Tran-quo seiz-ing his be-cause he want-ed it and Sir Clif-ford be-cause he was lord of the seignories of those parts Sir Clif-fordâ s whale has been ar-tic-u-lat-ed through-out so that like a great ch-est of draw-ers you can open and shut him in all his bony cav-i-tiesâ spread out his ribs like a gi-gan-tic fanâ and swing all day upon his low-er jaw Locks are to be put upon some of his trap doors and shut-ters and a foot-man will show round fu-ture visi-tors with a bunch of keys at his side Sir Clif-ford thinks of charg-ing twopence for a peep at the whis-per-ing gallery in the spinal col-umn three-pence to hear the echo in the hol-low of his cere-bel-lum and six-pence for the un-ri-valled view from his fore-head The skele-ton di-men-sions I shall now pro-ceed to set down are copied ver-ba-tim from my right arm where I had them tat-tooed as in my wild wan-der-ings at that pe-ri-od there was no other se-cure way of pre-serv-ing such valu-able statis-tics But as I was crowd-ed for space and wished the other parts of my body to re-main a blank page for a poem I was then com-pos-ingâ at least what un-tat-tooed parts might re-mainâ I did not trou-ble my-self with the odd inch-es nor in-deed should inch-es at all en-ter in-to a con-ge-nial ad-mea-sure-ment of the whale CHAPTER 13 Mea-sure-ment of The Whaleâ s Skele-ton In the first place I wish to lay be-fore you a par-tic-u-lar plain state-ment touch-ing the liv-ing bulk of this le-viathan whose skele-ton we are briefly to ex-hib-it Such a state-ment may prove use-ful here Ac-cord-ing to a care-ful cal-cu-la-tion I have made and which I part-ly base upon Cap-tain Scores-byâ s es-ti-mate of seven-ty tons for the largest sized Green-land whale of six-ty feet in length ac-cord-ing to my care-ful cal-cu-la-tion I say a Sperm Whale of the largest mag-ni-tude between eighty five and nine-ty feet in length and some-thing less than forty feet in its fullest cir-cum-fer-ence such a whale will weigh at least nine-ty tons so that reck-on-ing thir-teen men to a ton he would con-sid-er-ably outweigh the com-bined pop-u-la-tion of a whole vil-lage of one thou-sand one hun-dred in-hab-i-tan-ts Think you not then that brains like yoked cat-tle should be put to this le-viathan to make him at all budge to any lands-manâ s imag-i-na-tion Hav-ing al-ready in var-i-ous ways put be-fore you his skull spout hole jaw teeth tail fore-head fins and divers other parts I shall now sim-ply point out what is most in-ter-est-ing in the gen-er-al bulk of his unob-struct-ed bones But as the colos-sal skull em-braces so very large a pro-por-tion of the en-tire ex-tent of the skele-ton as it is by far the most com-pli-cat-ed part and as noth-ing is to be re-peat-ed con-cern-ing it in this chap-ter you must not fail to car-ry it in your mind or un-der your arm as we pro-ceed other-wise you will not gain a com-plete no-tion of the gen-er-al struc-ture we are about to view In length the Sperm Whaleâ s skele-ton at Tranque mea-sured seven-ty two feet so that when ful-ly in-vest-ed and ex-tend-ed in life he must have been nine-ty feet long for in the whale the skele-ton los-es about one fifth in length com-pared with the liv-ing body Of this seven-ty two feet his skull and jaw com-prised some twen-ty feet leav-ing some fifty feet of plain back bone At-tached to this back bone for some-thing less than a third of its length was the mighty cir-cu-lar bas-ket of ribs which once en-closed his vi-tals To me this vast ivory ribbed ch-est with the long un-re-lieved spine ex-tend-ing far away from it in a straight line not a lit-tle re-sem-bled the hull of a great ship new laid upon the stocks when on-ly some twen-ty of her naked bow ribs are insert-ed and the keel is other-wise for the time but a long dis-con-nect-ed tim-ber The ribs were ten on a side The first to be-gin from the neck was near-ly six feet long the se-cond third and fourth were each suc-ces-sive-ly longer till you came to the cli-max of the fifth or one of the mid-dle ribs which mea-sured eight feet and some inch-es From that part the re-main-ing ribs di-min-ished till the tenth and last on-ly spanned five feet and some inch-es In gen-er-al thick-ness they all bore a seem-ly cor-re-spon-dence to their length The mid-dle ribs were the most arched In some of the Ar-sacides they are used for beams where-on to lay foot-path bridges over small streams In con-sid-er-ing th-ese ribs I could not but be struck anew with the cir-cum-stance so var-i-ous-ly re-peat-ed in this book that the skele-ton of the whale is by no means the mould of his in-vest-ed form The largest of the Tranque ribs one of the mid-dle ones oc-cu-pied that part of the fish which in life is great-est in depth Now the great-est depth of the in-vest-ed body of this par-tic-u-lar whale must have been at least six-teen feet where-as the cor-re-spond-ing rib mea-sured but lit-tle more than eight feet So that this rib on-ly con-veyed half of the true no-tion of the liv-ing mag-ni-tude of that part Be-sides for some way where I now saw but a naked spine all that had been once wrapped round with tons of added bulk in flesh mus-cle blood and bow-els Still more for the am-ple fins I here saw but a few disor-dered join-ts and in place of the weighty and ma-jes-tic but bone-less flukes an ut-ter blank How vain and fool-ish then thought I for timid un-trav-elled man to try to com-pre-hend aright this won-drous whale by mere-ly por-ing over his dead at-ten-u-at-ed skele-ton stretched in this peace-ful wood No On-ly in the heart of quick-est per-ils on-ly when within the ed-dy-ings of his an-gry flukes on-ly on the pro-found un-bound-ed sea can the ful-ly in-vest-ed whale be tru-ly and liv-ing-ly found out But the spine For that the best way we can con-sid-er it is with a crane to pile its bones high up on end No speedy en-ter-prise But now itâ s done it looks much like Pom-peyâ s Pil-lar There are forty and odd ver-te-brÃ in all which in the skele-ton are not locked to-geth-er They most-ly lie like the great knobbed blocks on a Goth-ic spire form-ing sol-id cours-es of heavy ma-son-ry The largest a mid-dle one is in width some-thing less than three feet and in depth more than four The smallest where the spine tapers away in-to the tail is on-ly two inch-es in width and looks some-thing like a white bil-liard ball I was told that there were still smaller ones but they had been lost by some lit-tle can-ni-bal urchins the pri-estâ s chil-dren who had stolen them to play mar-bles with Thus we see how that the spine of even the hugest of liv-ing things tapers off at last in-to sim-ple childâ s play CHAPTER 14 The Fos-sil Whale From his mighty bulk the whale af-fords a most con-ge-nial theme where-on to en-large am-pli-fy and gen-er-al-ly ex-pa-ti-ate Would you you could not com-press him By good rights he should on-ly be treat-ed of in im-pe-ri-al fo-lio Not to tell over again his fur-longs from spir-a-cle to tail and the yards he mea-sures about the waist on-ly think of the gi-gan-tic in-vo-lu-tions of his in-testines where they lie in him like great cables and hawsers coiled away in the subter-ranean or-lop deck of a line of bat-tle ship Since I have un-der-tak-en to man-han-dle this Le-viathan it be-hooves me to ap-prove my-self om-ni-scient-ly ex-haus-tive in the en-ter-prise not over-look-ing the min-utest sem-i-nal ger-ms of his blood and spin-ning him out to the ut-ter-most coil of his bow-els Hav-ing al-ready de-scribed him in most of his pre-sent habi-ta-to-ry and anatom-i-cal pe-cu-liar-i-ties it now re-mains to mag-ni-fy him in an archÃ olog-i-cal fos-sil-if-er-ous and ante-dilu-vian point of view Ap-plied to any other crea-ture than the Le-viathanâ to an ant or a fleaâ such port-ly ter-ms might just-ly be deemed un-war-rantably grandil-o-quent But when Le-viathan is the text the case is al-tered Fain am I to stag-ger to this em-prise un-der the weight-i-est words of the dic-tionary And here be it said that when-ev-er it has been con-ve-nient to con-sult one in the course of th-ese dis-ser-ta-tions I have in-vari-ably used a huge quar-to edi-tion of John-son ex-press-ly pur-chased for that pur-pose be-cause that fa-mous lex-i-cog-ra-pherâ s un-com-mon per-son-al bulk more fit-ted him to com-pile a lex-i-con to be used by a whale author like me One often hears of writ-ers that rise and swell with their sub-ject though it may seem but an or-di-nary one How then with me writ-ing of this Le-viathan Un-con-scious-ly my chi-rog-ra-phy ex-pands in-to plac-ard cap-i-tals Give me a con-dorâ s quill Give me Ve-su-viusâ crater for an ink-stand Friends hold my ar-ms For in the mere act of pen-ning my thoughts of this Le-viathan they weary me and make me faint with their outreach-ing com-pre-hen-sive-ness of sweep as if to in-clude the whole cir-cle of the sciences and all the gen-er-a-tions of whales and men and mastodons past pre-sent and to come with all the re-volv-ing panora-mas of em-pire on earth and through-out the whole uni-verse not ex-clud-ing its subur-bs Such and so mag-ni-fy-ing is the virtue of a large and lib-er-al theme We ex-pand to its bulk To pro-duce a mighty book you must choose a mighty theme No great and en-dur-ing vol-ume can ever be writ-ten on the flea though many there be who have tried it Ere en-ter-ing upon the sub-ject of Fos-sil Whales I pre-sent my cre-den-tials as a ge-ol-o-gist by stat-ing that in my mis-cel-la-neous time I have been a stone ma-son and al-so a great dig-ger of ditch-es canals and wel-ls wine vaults cel-lars and cis-terns of all sorts Like-wise by way of pre-lim-i-nary I de-sire to re-mind the read-er that while in the ear-li-er ge-o-log-i-cal stra-ta there are found the fos-sils of mon-sters now al-most com-plete-ly ex-tinct the sub-se-quent relics dis-cov-ered in what are called the Ter-tiary for-ma-tions seem the con-nect-ing or at any rate in-ter-cept-ed links between the an-tichron-i-cal crea-tures and those whose re-mote pos-ter-i-ty are said to have en-tered the Ark all the Fos-sil Whales hither-to dis-cov-ered be-long to the Ter-tiary pe-ri-od which is the last pre-ced-ing the su-per-fi-cial for-ma-tions And though none of them pre-cise-ly an-swer to any known species of the pre-sent time they are yet suf-fi-cient-ly akin to them in gen-er-al re-spec-ts to jus-ti-fy their tak-ing rank as Ce-tacean fos-sils De-tached bro-ken fos-sils of pre adamite whales frag-men-ts of their bones and skele-tons have within thir-ty years past at var-i-ous in-ter-vals been found at the base of the Alps in Lom-bardy in France in Eng-land in Scot-land and in the States of Louisiana Mis-sis-sip-pi and Alaba-ma Among the more cu-ri-ous of such re-mains is part of a skull which in the year 1779 was dis-in-terred in the Rue Dauphine in Paris a short street open-ing al-most direct-ly upon the palace of the Tui-leries and bones dis-in-terred in ex-ca-vat-ing the great docks of An-twerp in Napoleonâ s time Cu-vi-er pro-nounced th-ese frag-men-ts to have be-longed to some ut-ter-ly un-known Le-viathanic species But by far the most won-der-ful of all Ce-tacean relics was the al-most com-plete vast skele-ton of an ex-tinct mon-ster found in the year 1842 on the plan-ta-tion of Judge Creagh in Alaba-ma The awe strick-en cred-u-lous slaves in the vicin-i-ty took it for the bones of one of the fallen an-gels The Alaba-ma doc-tors de-clared it a huge rep-tile and bestowed upon it the name of Basilosaurus But some spec-i-men bones of it be-ing tak-en across the sea to Owen the English Anatomist it turned out that this al-leged rep-tile was a whale though of a depart-ed species A sig-nif-i-cant il-lus-tra-tion of the fact again and again re-peat-ed in this book that the skele-ton of the whale fur-nish-es but lit-tle clue to the shape of his ful-ly in-vest-ed body So Owen rechris-tened the mon-ster Zeu-glodon and in his paper read be-fore the Lon-don Ge-o-log-i-cal So-ci-ety pro-nounced it in sub-stance one of the most ex-traor-di-nary crea-tures which the mu-ta-tions of the globe have blot-ted out of ex-is-tence When I stand among th-ese mighty Le-viathan skele-tons skul-ls tusks jaws ribs and ver-te-brÃ all char-ac-ter-ized by par-tial re-sem-blances to the ex-ist-ing breeds of sea mon-sters but at the same time bear-ing on the other hand sim-i-lar affini-ties to the an-ni-hi-lat-ed an-tichron-i-cal Le-viathans their in-cal-cu-la-ble se-niors I am by a flood borne back to that won-drous pe-ri-od ere time it-self can be said to have be-gun for time be-gan with man Here Saturnâ s grey chaos rol-ls over me and I ob-tain dim shud-der-ing glimpses in-to those Po-lar eter-ni-ties when wedged bas-tions of ice pressed hard upon what are now the Trop-ics and in all the 25  miles of this worldâ s cir-cum-fer-ence not an in-hab-it-able handâ s breadth of land was vis-i-ble Then the whole world was the whaleâ s and king of creation he left his wake along the pre-sent lines of the An-des and the Him-male-hs Who can show a pedi-gree like Le-viathan Ahabâ s har-poon had shed older blood than the Pharao-hâ s Methuse-lah seems a school boy I look round to shake hands with Shem I am hor-ror struck at this an-te-mo-sa-ic un-sourced ex-is-tence of the un-speak-able ter-rors of the whale which hav-ing been be-fore all time must needs ex-ist after all hu-mane ages are over But not alone has this Le-viathan left his pre adamite traces in the stereo-type plates of na-ture and in lime-stone and marl be-queathed his an-cient bust but upon Egyp-tian tablets whose an-tiq-ui-ty seems to claim for them an al-most fos-sil-if-er-ous char-ac-ter we find the un-mis-tak-able print of his fin In an apart-ment of the great tem-ple of Den-der-ah some fifty years ago there was dis-cov-ered upon the gran-ite ceil-ing a sculp-tured and paint-ed plani-sphere abound-ing in cen-tau-rs griffins and dol-phins sim-i-lar to the grotesque fig-ures on the ce-les-tial globe of the moderns Glid-ing among them old Le-viathan swam as of yore was there swim-ming in that plani-sphere cen-turies be-fore Solomon was cra-dled Nor must there be omit-ted another strange attes-ta-tion of the an-tiq-ui-ty of the whale in his own osseous post dilu-vian real-i-ty as set down by the ven-er-a-ble John Leo the old Bar-bary trav-eller â Not far from the Sea side they have a Tem-ple the Rafters and Beams of which are made of Whale Bones for Whales of a mon-strous size are of-ten-times cast up dead upon that shore The Com-mon Peo-ple imag-ine that by a se-cret Pow-er bestowed by God upon the Tem-ple no Whale can pass it without im-me-di-ate death But the truth of the Mat-ter is that on either side of the Tem-ple there are Rocks that shoot two Miles in-to the Sea and wound the Whales when they light upon â em They keep a Whaleâ s Rib of an in-cred-i-ble length for a Mir-a-cle which ly-ing upon the Ground with its con-vex part up-per-most makes an Arch the Head of which can-not be reached by a Man upon a Camelâ s Back This Rib says John Leo is said to have layn there a hun-dred Years be-fore I saw it Their His-to-ri-ans af-firm that a Prophet who proph-esyâ d of Ma-homet came from this Tem-ple and some do not stand to assert that the Prophet Jonas was cast forth by the Whale at the Base of the Tem-ple â In this Afric Tem-ple of the Whale I leave you read-er and if you be a Nan-tuck-eter and a whale-man you will si-lent-ly wor-ship there CHAPTER 15 Does the Whaleâ s Mag-ni-tude Di-min-ish â Will He Per-ish Inas-much then as this Le-viathan comes floun-der-ing down upon us from the head waters of the Eter-ni-ties it may be fit-ly in-quired whether in the long course of his gen-er-a-tions he has not de-gen-er-at-ed from the orig-i-nal bulk of his sires But upon in-ves-ti-ga-tion we find that not on-ly are the whales of the pre-sent day su-pe-ri-or in mag-ni-tude to those whose fos-sil re-mains are found in the Ter-tiary sys-tem em-brac-ing a distinct ge-o-log-i-cal pe-ri-od pri-or to man but of the whales found in that Ter-tiary sys-tem those be-long-ing to its lat-ter for-ma-tions ex-ceed in size those of its ear-li-er ones Of all the pre adamite whales yet ex-humed by far the largest is the Alaba-ma one men-tioned in the last chap-ter and that was less than seven-ty feet in length in the skele-ton Where-as we have al-ready seen that the tape mea-sure gives seven-ty two feet for the skele-ton of a large sized modern whale And I have heard on whale-menâ s author-i-ty that Sperm Whales have been cap-tured near a hun-dred feet long at the time of cap-ture But may it not be that while the whales of the pre-sent hour are an ad-vance in mag-ni-tude upon those of all pre-vi-ous ge-o-log-i-cal pe-ri-ods may it not be that since Adamâ s time they have de-gen-er-at-ed As-sured-ly we must con-clude so if we are to cred-it the ac-coun-ts of such gentle-men as Pliny and the an-cient nat-u-ral-ists gen-er-al-ly For Pliny tel-ls us of whales that em-braced acres of liv-ing bulk and Al-drovan-dus of others which mea-sured eight hun-dred feet in lengthâ Rope Walks and Thames Tun-nels of Whales And even in the days of Banks and Solan-der Cookeâ s nat-u-ral-ists we find a Dan-ish mem-ber of the Acade-my of Sciences set-ting down cer-tain Ice-land Whales rey-dan siskur or Wrin-kled Bel-lies at one hun-dred and twen-ty yards that is three hun-dred and six-ty feet And LacÃ pÃ de the French nat-u-ral-ist in his elab-o-rate his-to-ry of whales in the very begin-ning of his work page 3 sets down the Right Whale at one hun-dred me-tres three hun-dred and twen-ty eight feet And this work was pub-lished so late as A D 1825 But will any whale-man believe th-ese sto-ries No The whale of to day is as big as his ances-tors in Plinyâ s time And if ever I go where Pliny is I a whale-man more than he was will make bold to tell him so Be-cause I can-not un-der-stand how it is that while the Egyp-tian mum-mies that were buried thou-sands of years be-fore even Pliny was born do not mea-sure so much in their coffins as a modern Ken-tuck-ian in his socks and while the cat-tle and other an-i-mals sculp-tured on the oldest Egyp-tian and Nin-eveh tablets by the rel-a-tive pro-por-tions in which they are drawn just as plain-ly prove that the high bred stall fed prize cat-tle of Smith-field not on-ly equal but far ex-ceed in mag-ni-tude the fat-test of Pharao-hâ s fat kine in the face of all this I will not ad-mit that of all an-i-mals the whale alone should have de-gen-er-at-ed But still another in-quiry re-mains one often agi-tat-ed by the more re-con-dite Nan-tuck-eters Whether owing to the al-most om-ni-scient look outs at the mast heads of the whale ships now pen-e-trat-ing even through Behringâ s straits and in-to the re-motest se-cret draw-ers and lock-ers of the world and the thou-sand har-poons and lances dart-ed along all con-ti-nen-tal coasts the moot point is whether Le-viathan can long en-dure so wide a chase and so re-morse-less a hav-oc whether he must not at last be ex-ter-mi-nat-ed from the waters and the last whale like the last man smoke his last pipe and then him-self eva-po-rate in the fi-nal puff Com-par-ing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buf-fa-lo which not forty years ago over-spread by tens of thou-sands the prairies of Illi-nois and Mis-souri and shook their iron manes and scowled with their thun-der clot-ted brows upon the sites of pop-u-lous riv-er cap-i-tals where now the po-lite bro-ker sel-ls you land at a dol-lar an inch in such a com-par-i-son an ir-re-sistible ar-gu-ment would seem fur-nished to show that the hunt-ed whale can-not now es-cape speedy ex-tinc-tion But you must look at this mat-ter in every light Though so short a pe-ri-od agoâ not a good life-timeâ the cen-sus of the buf-fa-lo in Illi-nois ex-ceed-ed the cen-sus of men now in Lon-don and though at the pre-sent day not one horn or hoof of them re-mains in all that re-gion and though the cause of this won-drous ex-ter-mi-na-tion was the spear of man yet the far dif-fer-ent na-ture of the whale hunt peremp-to-ri-ly for-bids so in-glo-ri-ous an end to the Le-viathan Forty men in one ship hunt-ing the Sperm Whales for forty eight months think they have done ex-treme-ly well and thank God if at last they car-ry home the oil of forty fish Where-as in the days of the old Cana-di-an and In-di-an hun-ters and trap-pers of the West when the far west in whose sun-set suns still rise was a wilder-ness and a vir-gin the same num-ber of moc-casined men for the same num-ber of months mount-ed on horse in-stead of sail-ing in ships would have slain not forty but forty thou-sand and more buf-faloes a fact that if need were could be sta-tis-ti-cal-ly stat-ed Nor con-sid-ered aright does it seem any ar-gu-ment in favour of the grad-u-al ex-tinc-tion of the Sperm Whale for ex-am-ple that in former years the lat-ter part of the last cen-tu-ry say th-ese Le-viathans in small pods were en-coun-tered much often-er than at pre-sent and in con-se-quence the voy-ages were not so pro-longed and were al-so much more re-mu-ner-a-tive Be-cause as has been else-where no-ticed those whales in-flu-enced by some views to safe-ty now swim the seas in im-mense car-a-vans so that to a large de-gree the scat-tered soli-taries yokes and pods and schools of other days are now ag-gre-gat-ed in-to vast but wide-ly separat-ed un-fre-quent ar-mies That is all And equal-ly fal-la-cious seems the con-ceit that be-cause the so called whale bone whales no longer haunt many grounds in former years abound-ing with them hence that species al-so is de-clin-ing For they are on-ly be-ing driv-en from promon-to-ry to cape and if one coast is no longer en-livened with their jets then be sure some other and re-mot-er strand has been very re-cent-ly star-tled by the un-fa-mil-iar spec-ta-cle Fur-ther-more con-cern-ing th-ese last men-tioned Le-viathans they have two firm fortress-es which in all hu-man prob-a-bil-i-ty will for ever re-main im-preg-nable And as upon the in-va-sion of their val-leys the frosty Swiss have re-treat-ed to their moun-tains so hunt-ed from the sa-van-nas and glades of the mid-dle seas the whale bone whales can at last re-sort to their Po-lar ci-tadels and div-ing un-der the ul-ti-mate glassy bar-ri-ers and wal-ls there come up among icy fields and floes and in a charmed cir-cle of ever-last-ing De-cem-ber bid de-fi-ance to all pur-suit from man But as per-haps fifty of th-ese whale bone whales are har-pooned for one cachalot some philoso-phers of the fore-cas-tle have con-clud-ed that this pos-i-tive hav-oc has al-ready very se-ri-ous-ly di-min-ished their bat-tal-ions But though for some time past a num-ber of th-ese whales not less than 13  have been an-nu-al-ly slain on the norâ west coast by the Amer-i-cans alone yet there are con-sid-er-a-tions which ren-der even this cir-cum-stance of lit-tle or no ac-count as an op-pos-ing ar-gu-ment in this mat-ter Nat-u-ral as it is to be some-what in-cred-u-lous con-cern-ing the pop-u-lous-ness of the more enor-mous crea-tures of the globe yet what shall we say to Har-to the his-to-ri-an of Goa when he tel-ls us that at one hunt-ing the King of Si-am took 4  ele-phan-ts that in those re-gions ele-phan-ts are numer-ous as droves of cat-tle in the tem-per-ate climes And there seems no rea-son to doubt that if th-ese ele-phan-ts which have now been hunt-ed for thou-sands of years by Semi-ramis by Porus by Han-ni-bal and by all the suc-ces-sive monar-chs of the Eastâ if they still sur-vive there in great num-bers much more may the great whale out-last all hunt-ing since he has a pas-ture to ex-pa-ti-ate in which is pre-cise-ly twice as large as all Asia both Amer-i-c-as Europe and Africa New Hol-land and all the Isles of the sea com-bined More-over we are to con-sid-er that from the pre-sumed great longevi-ty of whales their prob-a-bly at-tain-ing the age of a cen-tu-ry and more there-fore at any one pe-ri-od of time sev-er-al distinct adult gen-er-a-tions must be con-tem-po-rary And what that is we may soon gain some idea of by imag-in-ing all the grave yards ceme-ter-ies and fam-i-ly vaults of creation yield-ing up the live bodies of all the men women and chil-dren who were alive seven-ty five years ago and ad-ding this count-less host to the pre-sent hu-man pop-u-la-tion of the globe Where-fore for all th-ese things we ac-count the whale im-mor-tal in his species how-ev-er per-ish-able in his in-di-vid-u-al-i-ty He swam the seas be-fore the con-ti-nen-ts broke water he once swam over the site of the Tui-leries and Wind-sor Cas-tle and the Krem-lin In Noahâ s flood he de-spised Noahâ s Ark and if ever the world is to be again flood-ed like the Nether-lands to kill off its rats then the eter-nal whale will still sur-vive and rear-ing upon the top-most crest of the equa-to-ri-al flood spout his frothed de-fi-ance to the skies CHAPTER 16 Ahabâ s Leg The pre-cip-i-tat-ing man-ner in which Cap-tain Ahab had quit-ted the Sa-muel En-der-by of Lon-don had not been unat-tend-ed with some small vi-o-lence to his own per-son He had light-ed with such en-er-gy upon a thwart of his boat that his ivory leg had re-ceived a half splin-ter-ing shock And when after gain-ing his own deck and his own piv-ot hole there he so ve-he-ment-ly wheeled round with an ur-gent com-mand to the steers-man it was as ever some-thing about his not steer-ing in-flex-i-bly enough then the al-ready shak-en ivory re-ceived such an ad-di-tion-al twist and wrench that though it still re-mained en-tire and to all ap-pear-ances lusty yet Ahab did not deem it en-tire-ly trust-wor-thy And in-deed it seemed small mat-ter for won-der that for all his per-vad-ing mad reck-less-ness Ahab did at times give care-ful heed to the con-di-tion of that dead bone upon which he part-ly stood For it had not been very long pri-or to the Pe-quodâ s sail-ing from Nan-tuck-et that he had been found one night ly-ing prone upon the ground and insen-si-ble by some un-known and seem-ing-ly in-ex-pli-ca-ble un-imag-in-able ca-su-al-ty his ivory limb hav-ing been so vi-o-lent-ly dis-placed that it had stake wise smit-ten and all but pierced his groin nor was it without ex-treme dif-fi-cul-ty that the ago-niz-ing wound was en-tire-ly cured Nor at the time had it failed to en-ter his mono-ma-ni-ac mind that all the an-guish of that then pre-sent suf-fer-ing was but the direct is-sue of a former woe and he too plain-ly seemed to see that as the most poi-sonous rep-tile of the marsh per-pet-u-ates his kind as inevitably as the sweet-est song-ster of the grove so equal-ly with every felic-i-ty all mis-er-able even-ts do nat-u-ral-ly beget their like Yea more than equal-ly thought Ahab since both the ances-try and pos-ter-i-ty of Grief go fur-ther than the ances-try and pos-ter-i-ty of Joy For not to hint of this that it is an in-fer-ence from cer-tain canon-ic teach-ings that while some nat-u-ral en-joy-men-ts here shall have no chil-dren born to them for the other world but on the con-trary shall be fol-lowed by the joy child-less-ness of all hel-lâ s de-s-pair where-as some guilty mor-tal mis-eries shall still fer-tile-ly beget to them-selves an eter-nal-ly pro-gres-sive proge-ny of griefs beyond the grave not at all to hint of this there still seems an inequal-i-ty in the deep-er anal-y-sis of the thing For thought Ahab while even the high-est earth-ly felic-i-ties ever have a cer-tain un-signi-fy-ing pet-ti-ness lurk-ing in them but at bot-tom all heart-woes a mys-tic sig-nif-i-cance and in some men an ar-changel-ic gran-deur so do their dili-gent trac-ings out not belie the ob-vi-ous de-duc-tion To trail the ge-nealo-gies of th-ese high mor-tal mis-eries car-ries us at last among the source-less pri-mo-gen-i-tures of the gods so that in the face of all the glad hay mak-ing suns and soft cym-balling round har-vest moons we must needs give in to this that the gods them-selves are not for ever glad The in-ef-face-able sad birth mark in the brow of man is but the stamp of sor-row in the sign-ers Un-wit-ting-ly here a se-cret has been divulged which per-haps might more prop-er-ly in set way have been dis-closed be-fore With many other par-tic-u-lars con-cern-ing Ahab al-ways had it re-mained a mys-tery to some why it was that for a cer-tain pe-ri-od both be-fore and after the sail-ing of the Pe-quod he had hid-den him-self away with such Grand La-ma like ex-clu-sive-ness and for that one in-ter-val sought speech-less refuge as it were among the mar-ble se-nate of the dead Cap-tain Pelegâ s bruit-ed rea-son for this thing ap-peared by no means ad-e-quate though in-deed as touch-ing all Ahabâ s deep-er part every reve-la-tion par-took more of sig-nif-i-cant dark-ness than of ex-plana-to-ry light But in the end it all came out this one mat-ter did at least That dire-ful mishap was at the bot-tom of his tem-po-rary recluse-ness And not on-ly this but to that ever con-tract-ing drop-ping cir-cle ashore who for any rea-son possessed the priv-i-lege of a less banned ap-proach to him to that timid cir-cle the above hint-ed ca-su-al-tyâ re-main-ing as it did mood-i-ly unac-count-ed for by Ahabâ in-vest-ed it-self with ter-rors not en-tire-ly un-derived from the land of spir-its and of wails So that through their zeal for him they had all con-spired so far as in them lay to muf-fle up the knowl-edge of this thing from others and hence it was that not till a con-sid-er-able in-ter-val had elapsed did it tran-spire upon the Pe-quodâ s decks But be all this as it may let the unseen am-bigu-ous syn-od in the air or the vin-dic-tive princes and po-ten-tates of fire have to do or not with earth-ly Ahab yet in this pre-sent mat-ter of his leg he took plain prac-ti-cal pro-ce-dures â he called the car-pen-ter And when that func-tionary ap-peared be-fore him he bade him without de-lay set about mak-ing a new leg and direct-ed the mates to see him sup-plied with all the studs and joists of jaw ivory Sperm Whale which had thus far been ac-cu-mu-lat-ed on the voy-age in order that a care-ful selec-tion of the stoutest clear-est grained stuff might be se-cured This done the car-pen-ter re-ceived orders to have the leg com-plet-ed that night and to pro-vide all the fit-tings for it in-de-pen-dent of those per-tain-ing to the distrust-ed one in use More-over the shipâ s forge was ordered to be hoist-ed out of its tem-po-rary idle-ness in the hold and to ac-cel-er-ate the af-fair the black-smith was com-mand-ed to pro-ceed at once to the forg-ing of what-ev-er iron con-trivances might be need-ed CHAPTER 17 The Car-pen-ter Seat thy-self sul-tan-i-cal-ly among the moons of Saturn and take high ab-stract-ed man alone and he seems a won-der a gran-deur and a woe But from the same point take mankind in mass and for the most part they seem a mob of un-nec-es-sary du-pli-cates both con-tem-po-rary and hered-i-tary But most hum-ble though he was and far from fur-nish-ing an ex-am-ple of the high hu-mane ab-strac-tion the Pe-quodâ s car-pen-ter was no du-pli-cate hence he now comes in per-son on this stage Like all sea go-ing ship car-pen-ters and more espe-cial-ly those be-long-ing to whal-ing ves-sels he was to a cer-tain off hand-ed prac-ti-cal ex-tent alike ex-pe-ri-enced in numer-ous trades and callings col-lat-er-al to his own the car-pen-terâ s pur-suit be-ing the an-cient and out-branch-ing trunk of all those numer-ous hand-i-crafts which more or less have to do with wood as an aux-il-iary ma-te-ri-al But be-sides the ap-pli-ca-tion to him of the gener-ic re-mark above this car-pen-ter of the Pe-quod was sin-gu-lar-ly ef-fi-cient in those thou-sand name-less me-chan-i-cal emer-gen-cies con-tin-u-al-ly re-cur-ring in a large ship upon a three or four yearsâ voy-age in un-civ-i-lized and far dis-tant seas For not to speak of his readi-ness in or-di-nary du-ties â re-pair-ing stove boats sprung spars re-form-ing the shape of clum-sy blad-ed oars insert-ing bul-lâ s eyes in the deck or new tree nails in the side planks and other mis-cel-la-neous mat-ters more direct-ly per-tain-ing to his spe-cial busi-ness he was more-over un-hesi-tat-ing-ly ex-pert in all man-ner of con-flict-ing ap-ti-tudes both use-ful and capri-cious The one grand stage where he en-act-ed all his var-i-ous parts so man-i-fold was his vice bench a long rude pon-der-ous table fur-nished with sev-er-al vices of dif-fer-ent sizes and both of iron and of wood At all times ex-cept when whales were along-side this bench was se-cure-ly lashed athwartships against the rear of the Try works A be-lay-ing pin is found too large to be easi-ly insert-ed in-to its hole the car-pen-ter claps it in-to one of his ever ready vices and straight-way files it smaller A lost land bird of strange plumage strays on board and is made a cap-tive out of clean shaved rods of right whale bone and cross beams of sperm whale ivory the car-pen-ter makes a pago-da look-ing cage for it An oars-man sprains his wrist the car-pen-ter con-coc-ts a sooth-ing lo-tion Stubb longed for ver-mil-lion stars to be paint-ed upon the blade of his every oar screw-ing each oar in his big vice of wood the car-pen-ter sym-met-ri-cal-ly sup-plies the con-stel-la-tion A sailor takes a fan-cy to wear shark bone ear rings the car-pen-ter dril-ls his ears Another has the toothache the car-pen-ter out pin-cers and clap-ping one hand upon his bench bids him be seat-ed there but the poor fel-low un-man-age-ably winces un-der the un-con-clud-ed oper-a-tion whirling round the han-dle of his wood-en vice the car-pen-ter signs him to clap his jaw in that if he would have him draw the tooth Thus this car-pen-ter was pre-pared at all poin-ts and alike in-dif-fer-ent and without re-spect in all Teeth he ac-count-ed bits of ivory heads he deemed but top blocks men them-selves he light-ly held for cap-stans But while now upon so wide a field thus var-i-ous-ly ac-com-plished and with such live-li-ness of ex-pert-ness in him too all this would seem to ar-gue some un-com-mon vi-vac-i-ty of in-tel-li-gence But not pre-cise-ly so For noth-ing was this man more re-mark-able than for a cer-tain im-per-son-al sto-lid-i-ty as it were im-per-son-al I say for it so shad-ed off in-to the sur-round-ing in-fi-nite of things that it seemed one with the gen-er-al sto-lid-i-ty dis-cernible in the whole vis-i-ble world which while pause-less-ly ac-tive in un-count-ed modes still eter-nal-ly holds its peace and ig-nores you though you dig foun-da-tions for cathe-drals Yet was this half hor-ri-ble sto-lid-i-ty in him in-volv-ing too as it ap-peared an all ram-i-fy-ing heart-less-ness â yet was it oddly dashed at times with an old crutch like ante-dilu-vian wheez-ing hu-mor-ous-ness not un-streaked now and then with a cer-tain griz-zled wit-ti-ness such as might have served to pass the time dur-ing the mid-night watch on the beard-ed fore-cas-tle of Noahâ s ark Was it that this old car-pen-ter had been a life long wan-derer whose much rolling to and fro not on-ly had gathered no moss but what is more had rubbed off what-ev-er small out-ward cling-ings might have orig-i-nal-ly per-tained to him He was a stript ab-stract an un-frac-tioned in-te-gral un-com-pro-mised as a new born babe liv-ing without premed-i-tat-ed ref-er-ence to this world or the next You might al-most say that this strange un-com-pro-mised-ness in him in-volved a sort of un-in-tel-li-gence for in his numer-ous trades he did not seem to work so much by rea-son or by in-stinct or sim-ply be-cause he had been tu-tored to it or by any in-ter-mix-ture of all th-ese even or un-even but mere-ly by a kind of deaf and dumb spon-ta-neous lit-er-al pro-cess He was a pure ma-nip-u-la-tor his brain if he had ever had one must have ear-ly oozed along in-to the mus-cles of his fingers He was like one of those un-rea-son-ing but still high-ly use-ful mul-tum in par-vo Sh-effield con-trivances as-sum-ing the ex-te-ri-orâ though a lit-tle swelledâ of a com-mon pock-et knife but con-tain-ing not on-ly blades of var-i-ous sizes but al-so screw drivers cork screws tweez-ers awls pens rulers nail fil-ers coun-ter-sinkers So if his su-pe-ri-ors want-ed to use the car-pen-ter for a screw driv-er all they had to do was to open that part of him and the screw was fast or if for tweez-ers take him up by the legs and there they were Yet as pre-vi-ous-ly hint-ed this om-ni-tooled open and shut car-pen-ter was after all no mere ma-chine of an au-toma-ton If he did not have a com-mon soul in him he had a sub-tle some-thing that some-how ano-ma-lous-ly did its du-ty What that was whether essence of quick-sil-ver or a few drops of hartshorn there is no telling But there it was and there it had abid-ed for now some six-ty years or more And this it was this same unac-count-able cun-ning life prin-ci-ple in him this it was that kept him a great part of the time so-lil-o-quiz-ing but on-ly like an un-rea-son-ing wheel which al-so hum-m-ing-ly so-lil-o-quizes or rather his body was a sen-try box and this so-lil-o-quiz-er on guard there and talk-ing all the time to keep him-self awake CHAPTER 18 Ahab and the Car-pen-ter The Deckâ First Night Watch Car-pen-ter stand-ing be-fore his vice bench and by the light of two lan-terns busi-ly fil-ing the ivory

Here I am proud as Greek god and yet stand-ing debtor to this block-head for a bone to stand on Cursed be that mor-tal in-ter in-debt-ed-ness which will not do away with ledgers I would be free as air and Iâ m down in the whole worldâ s books I am so rich I could have giv-en bid for bid with the wealth-i-est PrÃ to-ri-ans at the auc-tion of the Ro-man em-pire which was the worldâ s and yet I owe for the flesh in the tongue I brag with By heav-ens Iâ ll get a cru-cible and in-to it and dis-solve my-self down to one small com-pen-dious ver-te-bra So CARPENTER re-sum-ing his work Well well well Stubb knows him best of all and Stubb al-ways says heâ s queer says noth-ing but that one suf-fi-cient lit-tle word queer heâ s queer says Stubb heâ s queerâ queer queer and keeps din-ning it in-to Mr Star-buck all the timeâ queerâ sirâ queer queer very queer And hereâ s his leg Yes now that I think of it hereâ s his bed-fel-low has a stick of whaleâ s jaw bone for a wife And this is his leg heâ ll stand on this What was that now about one leg stand-ing in three places and all three places stand-ing in one hel-lâ how was that Oh I donâ t won-der he looked so scorn-ful at me Iâ m a sort of strange thought-ed some-times they say but thatâ s on-ly hap-haz-ard like Then a short lit-tle old body like me should nev-er un-der-take to wade out in-to deep waters with tall heron built cap-tains the water chucks you un-der the chin pret-ty quick and thereâ s a great cry for life boats And hereâ s the heronâ s leg long and slim sure enough Now for most folks one pair of legs lasts a life-time and that must be be-cause they use them mer-ci-ful-ly as a ten-der heart-ed old lady us-es her roly poly old coach hors-es But Ahab oh heâ s a hard driv-er Look driv-en one leg to death and spavined the other for life and now wears out bone legs by the cord Hal-loa there you Smut bear a hand there with those screws and letâ s fin-ish it be-fore the res-ur-rec-tion fel-low comes a calling with his horn for all legs true or false as brew-ery men go round col-lect-ing old beer bar-rels to fill â em up again What a leg this is It looks like a real live leg filed down to noth-ing but the core heâ ll be stand-ing on this to mor-row heâ ll be tak-ing alti-tudes on it Hal-loa I al-most for-got the lit-tle oval slate smoothed ivory where he fig-ures up the lat-i-tude So so chis-el file and sand paper now CHAPTER 19 Ahab and Star-buck in the Cabin Ac-cord-ing to usage they were pump-ing the ship next morn-ing and lo no in-con-sid-er-able oil came up with the water the casks below must have sprung a bad leak Much con-cern was shown and Star-buck went down in-to the cabin to re-port this un-favourable af-fair In Sperm whale-men with any con-sid-er-able quan-ti-ty of oil on board it is a reg-u-lar se-mi week-ly du-ty to con-duct a hose in-to the hold and drench the casks with sea water which after-wards at vary-ing in-ter-vals is re-moved by the shipâ s pumps Here-by the casks are sought to be kept dam-ply tight while by the changed char-ac-ter of the with-drawn water the mariners read-i-ly de-tect any se-ri-ous leak-age in the pre-cious car-go Now from the South and West the Pe-quod was draw-ing nigh to For-mosa and the Bashee Isles between which lies one of the trop-i-cal out-lets from the Chi-na waters in-to the Pa-cif-ic And so Star-buck found Ahab with a gen-er-al chart of the ori-en-tal archipela-goes spread be-fore him and another separate one rep-re-sent-ing the long eastern coasts of the Ja-panese is-land-sâ Niphon Mats-mai and Sikoke With his snow white new ivory leg braced against the screwed leg of his table and with a long prun-ing hook of a jack knife in his hand the won-drous old man with his back to the gang-way door was wrin-kling his brow and trac-ing his old cours-es again â Whoâ s there â hear-ing the foot-step at the door but not turn-ing round to it â On deck Be-gone â â Cap-tain Ahab mis-takes it is I The oil in the hold is leak-ing sir We must up Bur-tons and break out â â Up Bur-tons and break out Now that we are near-ing Ja-pan heave to here for a week to tinker a par-cel of old hoops â â Either do that sir or waste in one day more oil than we may make good in a year What we come twen-ty thou-sand miles to get is worth sav-ing sir â â So it is so it is if we get it â â I was speak-ing of the oil in the hold sir â â And I was not speak-ing or think-ing of that at all Be-gone Let it leak Iâ m all aleak my-self Aye leaks in leaks not on-ly full of leaky casks but those leaky casks are in a leaky ship and thatâ s a far worse plight than the Pe-quodâ s man Yet I donâ t stop to plug my leak for who can find it in the deep load-ed hull or how hope to plug it even if found in this lifeâ s howl-ing gale Star-buck Iâ ll not have the Bur-tons hoist-ed â â What will the own-ers say sir â â Let the own-ers stand on Nan-tuck-et beach and ou-tyell the Typhoons What cares Ahab Own-ers own-ers Thou art al-ways prat-ing to me Star-buck about those miser-ly own-ers as if the own-ers were my con-science But look ye the on-ly real own-er of any-thing is its com-man-der and hark ye my con-science is in this shipâ s keel â On deck â â Cap-tain Ahab â said the red-den-ing mate mov-ing fur-ther in-to the cabin with a dar-ing so strange-ly re-spect-ful and cau-tious that it al-most seemed not on-ly every way seek-ing to avoid the slight-est out-ward man-i-fes-ta-tion of it-self but within al-so seemed more than half distrust-ful of it-self â A bet-ter man than I might well pass over in thee what he would quick-ly enough re-sent in a younger man aye and in a hap-pi-er Cap-tain Ahab â â Devils Dost thou then so much as dare to crit-i-cal-ly think of me â On deck â â Nay sir not yet I do en-treat And I do dare sirâ to be for-bear-ing Shall we not un-der-stand each other bet-ter than hither-to Cap-tain Ahab â Ahab seized a load-ed mus-ket from the rack form-ing part of most South Sea menâ s cabin fur-ni-ture and point-ing it towards Star-buck ex-claimed â There is one God that is Lord over the earth and one Cap-tain that is lord over the Pe-quod â On deck â For an in-stant in the flash-ing eyes of the mate and his fiery cheeks you would have al-most thought that he had real-ly re-ceived the blaze of the lev-elled tube But mas-ter-ing his emo-tion he half calm-ly rose and as he quit-ted the cabin paused for an in-stant and said â Thou hast ou-traged not in-sult-ed me sir but for that I ask thee not to be-ware of Star-buck thou wouldst but laugh but let Ahab be-ware of Ahab be-ware of thy-self old man â â He wax-es brave but nev-er-the-less obeys most care-ful brav-ery that â mur-mured Ahab as Star-buck dis-ap-peared â Whatâ s that he saidâ Ahab be-ware of Ahabâ thereâ s some-thing there â Then un-con-scious-ly us-ing the mus-ket for a staff with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the lit-tle cabin but present-ly the thick plaits of his fore-head re-laxed and re-turn-ing the gun to the rack he went to the deck â Thou art but too good a fel-low Star-buck â he said low-ly to the mate then rais-ing his voice to the crew â Furl the tâ gal-lant sails and close reef the top sails fore and aft back the main yard up Bur-ton and break out in the main hold â It were per-haps vain to sur-mise ex-act-ly why it was that as re-spect-ing Star-buck Ahab thus act-ed It may have been a flash of hon-esty in him or mere pru-den-tial pol-i-cy which un-der the cir-cum-stance im-pe-ri-ous-ly for-bade the slight-est symp-tom of open disaf-fec-tion how-ev-er tran-sient in the im-por-tant chief of-fi-cer of his ship How-ev-er it was his orders were ex-e-cut-ed and the Bur-tons were hoist-ed CHAPTER 11 Quee-queg in His Cof-fin Upon search-ing it was found that the casks last struck in-to the hold were per-fect-ly sound and that the leak must be fur-ther off So it be-ing calm weather they broke out deep-er and deep-er dis-turb-ing the slum-bers of the huge ground ti-er but-ts and from that black mid-night send-ing those gi-gan-tic moles in-to the day-light above So deep did they go and so an-cient and cor-rod-ed and weedy the aspect of the low-er-most pun-cheons that you al-most looked next for some mouldy corner stone cask con-tain-ing coins of Cap-tain Noah with copies of the post-ed plac-ards vain-ly warn-ing the in-fat-u-at-ed old world from the flood Tierce after tierce too of water and bread and beef and shooks of staves and iron bun-dles of hoops were hoist-ed out till at last the piled decks were hard to get about and the hol-low hull echoed un-der foot as if you were tread-ing over emp-ty cat-a-com-bs and reeled and rolled in the sea like an air freight-ed demi-john Top heavy was the ship as a din-ner-less stu-dent with all Aris-to-tle in his head Well was it that the Typhoons did not visit them then Now at this time it was that my poor pa-gan com-pan-ion and fast bo-som friend Quee-queg was seized with a fev-er which brought him nigh to his end-less end Be it said that in this vo-ca-tion of whal-ing sinecures are un-known dig-ni-ty and danger go hand in hand till you get to be Cap-tain the higher you rise the harder you toil So with poor Quee-queg who as har-pooneer must not on-ly face all the rage of the liv-ing whale butâ as we have else-where seenâ mount his dead back in a rolling sea and fi-nal-ly descend in-to the gloom of the hold and bit-ter-ly sweat-ing all day in that subter-ra-ne-ous con-fine-ment res-o-lute-ly man-han-dle the clum-si-est casks and see to their stowage To be short among whale-men the har-pooneers are the hold-ers so called Poor Quee-queg when the ship was about half disem-bow-elled you should have stooped over the hatch-way and peered down upon him there where stripped to his woollen draw-ers the tat-tooed sav-age was crawl-ing about amid that damp-ness and slime like a green spot-ted lizard at the bot-tom of a well And a well or an ice house it some-how proved to him poor pa-gan where strange to say for all the heat of his sweat-ings he caught a ter-ri-ble chill which lapsed in-to a fev-er and at last after some daysâ suf-fer-ing laid him in his ham-mock close to the very sill of the door of death How he wast-ed and wast-ed away in those few long lin-ger-ing days till there seemed but lit-tle left of him but his frame and tat-too-ing But as all else in him thinned and his cheek bones grew sharp-er his eyes nev-er-the-less seemed grow-ing fuller and fuller they be-came of a strange soft-ness of lus-tre and mild-ly but deeply looked out at you there from his sick-ness a won-drous tes-ti-mo-ny to that im-mor-tal health in him which could not die or be weak-ened And like cir-cles on the water which as they grow fain-ter ex-pand so his eyes seemed round-ing and round-ing like the rings of Eter-ni-ty An awe that can-not be named would steal over you as you sat by the side of this wan-ing sav-age and saw as strange things in his face as any be-held who were by-s-tanders when Zoroast-er died For what-ev-er is tru-ly won-drous and fear-ful in man nev-er yet was put in-to words or books And the draw-ing near of Death which alike levels all alike im-press-es all with a last reve-la-tion which on-ly an author from the dead could ad-e-quate-ly tell So thatâ let us say it againâ no dy-ing Chaldee or Greek had higher and holi-er thoughts than those whose mys-te-ri-ous shades you saw creep-ing over the face of poor Quee-queg as he qui-et-ly lay in his sway-ing ham-mock and the rolling sea seemed gent-ly rock-ing him to his fi-nal rest and the oceanâ s in-vis-i-ble flood tide lift-ed him higher and higher towards his destined heav-en Not a man of the crew but gave him up and as for Quee-queg him-self what he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a cu-ri-ous favour he asked He called one to him in the grey morn-ing watch when the day was just break-ing and tak-ing his hand said that while in Nan-tuck-et he had chanced to see cer-tain lit-tle ca-noes of dark wood like the rich war wood of his na-tive isle and upon in-quiry he had learned that all whale-men who died in Nan-tuck-et were laid in those same dark ca-noes and that the fan-cy of be-ing so laid had much pleased him for it was not un-like the cus-tom of his own race who after em-balm-ing a dead war-rior stretched him out in his ca-noe and so left him to be float-ed away to the star-ry archipela-goes for not on-ly do they believe that the stars are isles but that far beyond all vis-i-ble hori-zons their own mild un-con-ti-nent-ed seas in-ter-flow with the blue heav-ens and so form the white break-ers of the milky way He added that he shud-dered at the thought of be-ing buried in his ham-mock ac-cord-ing to the usu-al sea cus-tom tossed like some-thing vile to the death devour-ing sharks No he de-sired a ca-noe like those of Nan-tuck-et all the more con-ge-nial to him be-ing a whale-man that like a whale boat th-ese cof-fin ca-noes were without a keel though that in-volved but uncer-tain steer-ing and much lee way adown the dim ages Now when this strange cir-cum-stance was made known aft the car-pen-ter was at once com-mand-ed to do Quee-quegâ s bid-ding what-ev-er it might in-clude There was some hea-then-ish cof-fin coloured old lum-ber aboard which upon a long pre-vi-ous voy-age had been cut from the abo-rig-i-nal groves of the Lack-a-day is-lands and from th-ese dark planks the cof-fin was rec-om-mend-ed to be made No soon-er was the car-pen-ter ap-prised of the order than tak-ing his rule he forth-with with all the in-dif-fer-ent promp-ti-tude of his char-ac-ter pro-ceed-ed in-to the fore-cas-tle and took Quee-quegâ s mea-sure with great ac-cu-ra-cy reg-u-lar-ly chalk-ing Quee-quegâ s per-son as he shift-ed the rule â Ah poor fel-low heâ ll have to die now â ejac-u-lat-ed the Long Is-land sailor Go-ing to his vice bench the car-pen-ter for con-ve-nience sake and gen-er-al ref-er-ence now trans-fer-ring-ly mea-sured on it the ex-act length the cof-fin was to be and then made the trans-fer per-ma-nent by cut-ting two notch-es at its ex-trem-i-ties This done he mar-shalled the planks and his tools and to work When the last nail was driv-en and the lid du-ly planed and fit-ted he light-ly shoul-dered the cof-fin and went for-ward with it in-quir-ing whether they were ready for it yet in that direc-tion Over-hear-ing the indig-nant but half hu-mor-ous cries with which the peo-ple on deck be-gan to drive the cof-fin away Quee-queg to every oneâ s con-ster-na-tion com-mand-ed that the thing should be in-stant-ly brought to him nor was there any deny-ing him see-ing that of all mor-tals some dy-ing men are the most tyran-ni-cal and cer-tain-ly since they will short-ly trou-ble us so lit-tle for ever-more the poor fel-lows ought to be in-dulged Lean-ing over in his ham-mock Quee-queg long re-gard-ed the cof-fin with an at-ten-tive eye He then called for his har-poon had the wood-en stock drawn from it and then had the iron part placed in the cof-fin along with one of the pad-dles of his boat All by his own re-quest al-so bis-cuits were then ranged round the sides within a flask of fresh water was placed at the head and a small bag of woody earth scraped up in the hold at the foot and a piece of sail cloth be-ing rolled up for a pil-low Quee-queg now en-treat-ed to be lift-ed in-to his fi-nal bed that he might make tri-al of its com-forts if any it had He lay without mov-ing a few min-utes then told one to go to his bag and bring out his lit-tle god Yo-jo Then cross-ing his ar-ms on his breast with Yo-jo between he called for the cof-fin lid hatch he called it to be placed over him The head part turned over with a leather hinge and there lay Quee-queg in his cof-fin with lit-tle but his com-posed coun-te-nance in view â Rar-maiâ it will do it is easy he mur-mured at last and signed to be re-placed in his ham-mock But ere this was done Pip who had been slily hover-ing near by all this while drew nigh to him where he lay and with soft sob-bings took him by the hand in the other hold-ing his tam-bourine â Poor rover will ye nev-er have done with all this weary rov-ing where go ye now But if the cur-ren-ts car-ry ye to those sweet An-tilles where the beach-es are on-ly beat with water lilies will ye do one lit-tle er-rand for me Seek out one Pip whoâ s now been miss-ing long I think heâ s in those far An-tilles If ye find him then com-fort him for he must be very sad for look heâ s left his tam-bourine be-hind â I found it Rig a dig dig dig Now Quee-queg die and Iâ ll beat ye your dy-ing march â â I have heard â mur-mured Star-buck gaz-ing down the scut-tle â that in vi-o-lent fev-ers men all ig-no-rance have talked in an-cient tongues and that when the mys-tery is probed it turns out al-ways that in their whol-ly for-got-ten child-hood those an-cient tongues had been real-ly spo-ken in their hear-ing by some lofty schol-ars So to my fond faith poor Pip in this strange sweet-ness of his lu-na-cy brings heav-en-ly vouch-ers of all our heav-en-ly homes Where learned he that but there â Hark he speaks again but more wild-ly now â â Form two and two Letâ s make a Gen-er-al of him Ho whereâ s his har-poon Lay it across here â Rig a dig dig dig huz-za Oh for a game cock now to sit upon his head and crow Quee-queg dies game â mind ye that Quee-queg dies game â take ye good heed of that Quee-queg dies game I say game game game but base lit-tle Pip he died a coward died all aâ shiv-er â out upon Pip Hark ye if ye find Pip tell all the An-tilles heâ s a ru-n-away a coward a coward a coward Tell them he jumped from a whale boat Iâ d nev-er beat my tam-bourine over base Pip and hail him Gen-er-al if he were once more dy-ing here No no shame upon all coward-sâ shame upon them Let â em go drown like Pip that jumped from a whale boat Shame shame â Dur-ing all this Quee-queg lay with closed eyes as if in a dream Pip was led away and the sick man was re-placed in his ham-mock But now that he had ap-par-ent-ly made every prepa-ra-tion for death now that his cof-fin was proved a good fit Quee-queg sud-den-ly ral-lied soon there seemed no need of the car-pen-terâ s box and there-upon when some ex-pressed their de-light-ed sur-prise he in sub-stance said that the cause of his sud-den con-va-les-cence was this â at a crit-i-cal mo-ment he had just re-called a lit-tle du-ty ashore which he was leav-ing un-done and there-fore had changed his mind about dy-ing he could not die yet he averred They asked him then whether to live or die was a mat-ter of his own sovereign will and plea-sure He an-swered cer-tain-ly In a word it was Quee-quegâ s con-ceit that if a man made up his mind to live mere sick-ness could not kill him noth-ing but a whale or a gale or some vi-o-lent un-govern-able un-in-tel-li-gent de-stroy-er of that sort Now there is this note-wor-thy dif-fer-ence between sav-age and civ-i-lized that while a sick civ-i-lized man may be six months con-va-lesc-ing gen-er-al-ly speak-ing a sick sav-age is al-most half well again in a day So in good time my Quee-queg gained strength and at length after sit-ting on the wind-lass for a few in-do-lent days but eat-ing with a vig-or-ous ap-petite he sud-den-ly leaped to his feet threw out his ar-ms and legs gave him-self a good stretch-ing yawned a lit-tle bit and then spring-ing in-to the head of his hoist-ed boat and pois-ing a har-poon pro-nounced him-self fit for a fight With a wild whim-si-ness he now used his cof-fin for a sea ch-est and emp-ty-ing in-to it his can-vas bag of clothes set them in order there Many spare hours he spent in carv-ing the lid with all man-ner of grotesque fig-ures and draw-ings and it seemed that here-by he was striv-ing in his rude way to copy parts of the twist-ed tat-too-ing on his body And this tat-too-ing had been the work of a depart-ed prophet and seer of his is-land who by those hiero-glyph-ic marks had writ-ten out on his body a com-plete the-o-ry of the heav-ens and the earth and a mys-ti-cal trea-tise on the art of at-tain-ing truth so that Quee-queg in his own prop-er per-son was a rid-dle to un-fold a won-drous work in one vol-ume but whose mys-ter-ies not even him-self could read though his own live heart beat against them and th-ese mys-ter-ies were there-fore destined in the end to moul-der away with the liv-ing parch-ment where-on they were in-scribed and so be un-solved to the last And this thought it must have been which suggest-ed to Ahab that wild ex-cla-ma-tion of his when one morn-ing turn-ing away from sur-vey-ing poor Quee-quegâ â Oh devil-ish tan-taliza-tion of the gods â CHAPTER 111 The Pa-cif-ic When glid-ing by the Bashee isles we emerged at last upon the great South Sea were it not for other things I could have greet-ed my dear Pa-cif-ic with un-count-ed thanks for now the long sup-pli-ca-tion of my youth was an-swered that serene ocean rolled east-wards from me a thou-sand leagues of blue There is one knows not what sweet mys-tery about this sea whose gent-ly aw-ful stir-rings seem to speak of some hid-den soul be-neath like those fabled un-du-la-tions of the Eph-e-sian sod over the buried Evan-ge-list St John And meet it is that over th-ese sea pas-tures wide rolling watery prairies and Pot-ter-sâ Fields of all four con-ti-nen-ts the waves should rise and fall and ebb and flow unceas-ing-ly for here mil-lions of mixed shades and shad-ows drowned dreams som-nam-bu-lis-ms rev-er-ies all that we call lives and souls lie dream-ing dream-ing still toss-ing like slum-ber-ers in their beds the ever rolling waves but made so by their rest-less-ness To any med-i-ta-tive Ma-gian rover this serene Pa-cif-ic once be-held must ever after be the sea of his adop-tion It rol-ls the mid-most waters of the world the In-di-an ocean and At-lantic be-ing but its ar-ms The same waves wash the moles of the new built Cal-i-for-ni-an towns but yes-ter-day plant-ed by the re-cen-test race of men and lave the fad-ed but still gor-geous skirts of Asi-at-ic lands older than Abra-ham while all between float milky ways of co-ral isles and low ly-ing end-less un-known Archipela-goes and im-pen-e-tra-ble Ja-pans Thus this mys-te-ri-ous divine Pa-cif-ic zones the worldâ s whole bulk about makes all coasts one bay to it seems the tide beat-ing heart of earth Lift-ed by those eter-nal swells you needs must own the se-duc-tive god bow-ing your head to Pan But few thoughts of Pan stirred Ahabâ s brain as stand-ing like an iron stat-ue at his ac-cus-tomed place be-side the mizen rig-ging with one nostril he un-think-ing-ly snuffed the su-gary musk from the Bashee isles in whose sweet woods mild lovers must be walk-ing and with the other con-scious-ly in-haled the salt breath of the new found sea that sea in which the hat-ed White Whale must even then be swim-ming Launched at length upon th-ese al-most fi-nal waters and glid-ing towards the Ja-panese cruis-ing ground the old manâ s pur-pose in-ten-si-fied it-self His firm lips met like the lips of a vice the Delta of his fore-headâ s veins swelled like over-laden brooks in his very sleep his ring-ing cry ran through the vault-ed hull â Stern all the White Whale spouts thick blood â CHAPTER 112 The Black-smith Avail-ing him-self of the mild sum-mer cool weather that now reigned in th-ese lat-i-tudes and in prepa-ra-tion for the pe-cu-liar-ly ac-tive pur-suits short-ly to be an-tic-i-pat-ed Perth the be-grimed blis-tered old black-smith had not re-moved his portable forge to the hold again after con-clud-ing his con-trib-u-to-ry work for Ahabâ s leg but still re-tained it on deck fast lashed to ring-bolts by the fore-mast be-ing now al-most inces-sant-ly in-voked by the heads-men and har-pooneers and bows-men to do some lit-tle job for them al-ter-ing or re-pair-ing or new shap-ing their var-i-ous weapons and boat fur-ni-ture Often he would be sur-round-ed by an eager cir-cle all wait-ing to be served hold-ing boat spades pike heads har-poons and lances and jeal-ous-ly watch-ing his every sooty move-ment as he toiled Nev-er-the-less this old manâ s was a pa-tient ham-mer wield-ed by a pa-tient arm No mur-mur no im-pa-tience no pe-tu-lance did come from him Si-lent slow and solemn bow-ing over still fur-ther his chron-i-cal-ly bro-ken back he toiled away as if toil were life it-self and the heavy beat-ing of his ham-mer the heavy beat-ing of his heart And so it was â Most mis-er-able A pe-cu-liar walk in this old man a cer-tain slight but pain-ful ap-pear-ing yaw-ing in his gait had at an ear-ly pe-ri-od of the voy-age ex-cit-ed the cu-rios-i-ty of the mariners And to the im-por-tu-ni-ty of their per-sist-ed ques-tion-ings he had fi-nal-ly giv-en in and so it came to pass that every one now knew the shame-ful sto-ry of his wretched fate Be-lat-ed and not in-no-cent-ly one bit-ter win-terâ s mid-night on the road run-ning between two coun-try towns the black-smith half stupid-ly felt the dead-ly numb-ness steal-ing over him and sought refuge in a lean-ing di-lap-i-dat-ed barn The is-sue was the loss of the ex-trem-i-ties of both feet Out of this reve-la-tion part by part at last came out the four ac-ts of the glad-ness and the one long and as yet un-catas-tro-phied fifth act of the grief of his lifeâ s dra-ma He was an old man who at the age of near-ly six-ty had post-poned-ly en-coun-tered that thing in sor-rowâ s tech-ni-cals called ruin He had been an ar-ti-san of famed ex-cel-lence and with plen-ty to do owned a house and gar-den em-braced a youth-ful daugh-ter like lov-ing wife and three blithe rud-dy chil-dren every Sun-day went to a cheer-ful look-ing church plant-ed in a grove But one night un-der cover of dark-ness and fur-ther con-cealed in a most cun-ning dis-guise-ment a des-per-ate bur-glar slid in-to his hap-py home and robbed them all of every-thing And dark-er yet to tell the black-smith him-self did ig-no-rant-ly con-duct this bur-glar in-to his fam-i-lyâ s heart It was the Bot-tle Con-juror Upon the open-ing of that fatal cork forth flew the fiend and shriv-elled up his home Now for pru-dent most wise and eco-nom-ic rea-sons the black-smithâ s shop was in the base-ment of his dwelling but with a separate en-trance to it so that al-ways had the young and lov-ing healthy wife lis-tened with no un-hap-py ner-vous-ness but with vig-or-ous plea-sure to the stout ring-ing of her young armed old hus-bandâ s ham-mer whose re-ver-ber-a-tions muf-fled by pass-ing through the floors and wal-ls came up to her not un-sweet-ly in her nurs-ery and so to stout Laborâ s iron lul-la-by the black-smithâ s in-fan-ts were rocked to slum-ber Oh woe on woe Oh Death why canst thou not some-times be time-ly Hadst thou tak-en this old black-smith to thy-self ere his full ruin came upon him then had the young wi-d-ow had a de-li-cious grief and her or-phans a tru-ly ven-er-a-ble le-gendary sire to dream of in their after years and all of them a care killing com-pe-ten-cy But Death plucked down some vir-tu-ous elder brother on whose whistling dai-ly toil sole-ly hung the re-spon-si-bil-i-ties of some other fam-i-ly and left the worse than use-less old man stand-ing till the hideous rot of life should make him easi-er to har-vest Why tell the whole The blows of the base-ment ham-mer every day grew more and more between and each blow every day grew fain-ter than the last the wife sat frozen at the win-dow with tear-less eyes glit-ter-ing-ly gaz-ing in-to the weep-ing faces of her chil-dren the bel-lows fell the forge choked up with cin-ders the house was sold the mother dived down in-to the long church yard grass her chil-dren twice fol-lowed her thith-er and the house-less fam-i-ly-less old man stag-gered off a vagabond in crape his every woe un-rev-er-enced his grey head a scorn to flax-en curls Death seems the on-ly de-sir-able se-quel for a ca-reer like this but Death is on-ly a launch-ing in-to the re-gion of the strange Un-tried it is but the first sa-lu-ta-tion to the pos-si-bil-i-ties of the im-mense Re-mote the Wild the Watery the Un-shored there-fore to the death long-ing eyes of such men who still have left in them some in-te-ri-or com-punc-tions against sui-cide does the all con-tribut-ed and all re-cep-tive ocean al-lur-ing-ly spread forth his whole plain of un-imag-in-able tak-ing ter-rors and won-der-ful new life ad-ven-tures and from the hearts of in-fi-nite Pacifics the thou-sand mer-maids sing to themâ â Come hither bro-ken heart-ed here is another life without the guilt of in-ter-me-di-ate death here are won-ders su-per-nat-u-ral without dy-ing for them Come hither bury thy-self in a life which to your now equal-ly ab-horred and ab-hor-ring land-ed world is more obliv-i-ous than death Come hither put up thy grave-stone too within the church-yard and come hither till we mar-ry thee â Hear-ken-ing to th-ese voic-es East and West by ear-ly sun-rise and by fall of eve the black-smithâ s soul re-spond-ed Aye I come And so Perth went a whal-ing CHAPTER 113 The Forge With mat-ted beard and swathed in a bristling shark skin apron about mid day Perth was stand-ing between his forge and anvil the lat-ter placed upon an iron wood log with one hand hold-ing a pike head in the coals and with the other at his forgeâ s lungs when Cap-tain Ahab came along car-ry-ing in his hand a small rusty look-ing leath-ern bag While yet a lit-tle dis-tance from the forge moody Ahab paused till at last Perth with-draw-ing his iron from the fire be-gan ham-mer-ing it upon the anvilâ the red mass send-ing off the sparks in thick hover-ing flights some of which flew close to Ahab â Are th-ese thy Mother Careyâ s chick-ens Perth they are al-ways fly-ing in thy wake birds of good omen too but not to all â look here they burn but thouâ thou livâ st among them without a scorch â â Be-cause I am scorched all over Cap-tain Ahab â an-swered Perth rest-ing for a mo-ment on his ham-mer â I am past scorch-ing not easi-ly canâ st thou scorch a scar â â Well well no more Thy shrunk voice sounds too calm-ly sane-ly woe-ful to me In no Par-adise my-self I am im-pa-tient of all mis-ery in others that is not mad Thou shouldâ st go mad black-smith say why dost thou not go mad How canâ st thou en-dure without be-ing mad Do the heav-ens yet hate thee that thou canâ st not go mad â What wert thou mak-ing there â â Weld-ing an old pike head sir there were seams and den-ts in it â â And canâ st thou make it all smooth again black-smith after such hard usage as it had â â I think so sir â â And I sup-pose thou canâ st smoothe al-most any seams and den-ts nev-er mind how hard the me-tal black-smith â â Aye sir I think I can all seams and den-ts but one â â Look ye here then â cried Ahab pas-sion-ate-ly ad-vanc-ing and lean-ing with both hands on Perthâ s shoul-ders â look ye hereâ here â can ye smoothe out a seam like this black-smith â sweep-ing one hand across his ribbed brow â if thou couldâ st black-smith glad enough would I lay my head upon thy anvil and feel thy heav-i-est ham-mer between my eyes An-swer Canâ st thou smoothe this seam â â Oh that is the one sir Said I not all seams and den-ts but one â â Aye black-smith it is the one aye man it is uns-mooth-able for though thou on-ly seeâ st it here in my flesh it has worked down in-to the bone of my skul-lâ that is all wrin-kles But away with childâ s play no more gaffs and pikes to day Look ye here â jin-gling the leath-ern bag as if it were full of gold coins â I too want a har-poon made one that a thou-sand yoke of fiends could not part Perth some-thing that will stick in a whale like his own fin bone Thereâ s the stuff â fling-ing the pouch upon the anvil â Look ye black-smith th-ese are the gathered nail stub-bs of the steel shoes of rac-ing hors-es â â Horse shoe stub-bs sir Why Cap-tain Ahab thou hast here then the best and stub-bornest stuff we black-smiths ever work â â I know it old man th-ese stub-bs will weld to-geth-er like glue from the melt-ed bones of mur-der-ers Quick forge me the har-poon And forge me first twelve rods for its shank then wind and twist and ham-mer th-ese twelve to-geth-er like the yarns and strands of a tow line Quick Iâ ll blow the fire â When at last the twelve rods were made Ahab tried them one by one by spi-ralling them with his own hand round a long heavy iron bolt â A flaw â re-ject-ing the last one â Work that over again Perth â This done Perth was about to be-gin weld-ing the twelve in-to one when Ahab stayed his hand and said he would weld his own iron As then with reg-u-lar gasp-ing hems he ham-mered on the anvil Perth pass-ing to him the glow-ing rods one after the other and the hard pressed forge shoot-ing up its in-tense straight flame the Parsee passed si-lent-ly and bow-ing over his head towards the fire seemed in-vok-ing some curse or some bless-ing on the toil But as Ahab looked up he slid aside â Whatâ s that bunch of lu-cifers dodg-ing about there for â mut-tered Stubb look-ing on from the fore-cas-tle â That Parsee smel-ls fire like a fusee and smel-ls of it him-self like a hot mus-ketâ s pow-der pan â At last the shank in one com-plete rod re-ceived its fi-nal heat and as Perth to tem-per it plunged it all hiss-ing in-to the cask of water near by the scald-ing steam shot up in-to Ahabâ s bent face â Wouldâ st thou brand me Perth â winc-ing for a mo-ment with the pain â have I been but forg-ing my own brand-ing iron then â â Pray God not that yet I fear some-thing Cap-tain Ahab Is not this har-poon for the White Whale â â For the white fiend But now for the bar-bs thou must make them thy-self man Here are my ra-zorsâ the best of steel here and make the bar-bs sharp as the nee-dle sleet of the Icy Sea â For a mo-ment the old black-smith eyed the ra-zors as though he would fain not use them â Take them man I have no need for them for I now nei-ther shave sup nor pray til-lâ but hereâ to work â Fash-ioned at last in-to an ar-rowy shape and weld-ed by Perth to the shank the steel soon point-ed the end of the iron and as the black-smith was about giv-ing the bar-bs their fi-nal heat pri-or to tem-per-ing them he cried to Ahab to place the water cask near â No noâ no water for that I want it of the true death tem-per Ahoy there Tashtego Quee-queg Dag-goo What say ye pa-gans Will ye give me as much blood as will cover this barb â hold-ing it high up A clus-ter of dark nods replied Yes Three punc-tures were made in the hea-then flesh and the White Whaleâ s bar-bs were then tem-pered â Ego non bap-ti-zo te in nomine pa-tris sed in nomine di-aboli â deliri-ous-ly howled Ahab as the malig-nant iron scorch-ing-ly devoured the bap-tismal blood Now mus-ter-ing the spare poles from below and select-ing one of hick-o-ry with the bark still in-vest-ing it Ahab fit-ted the end to the sock-et of the iron A coil of new tow line was then un-wound and some fath-oms of it tak-en to the wind-lass and stretched to a great ten-sion Press-ing his foot upon it till the rope hummed like a harp string then eager-ly bend-ing over it and see-ing no strand-ings Ahab ex-claimed â Good and now for the seiz-ings â At one ex-trem-i-ty the rope was un-strand-ed and the separate spread yarns were all braid-ed and woven round the sock-et of the har-poon the pole was then driv-en hard up in-to the sock-et from the low-er end the rope was traced half way along the poleâ s length and firm-ly se-cured so with in-ter-twist-ings of twine This done pole iron and ropeâ like the Three Fatesâ re-mained insep-a-ra-ble and Ahab mood-i-ly stalked away with the weapon the sound of his ivory leg and the sound of the hick-o-ry pole both hol-low-ly ring-ing along every plank But ere he en-tered his cabin light un-nat-u-ral half ban-ter-ing yet most pi-teous sound was heard Oh Pip thy wretched laugh thy idle but un-rest-ing eye all thy strange mum-meries not un-mean-ing-ly blend-ed with the black tragedy of the me-lan-choly ship and mocked it CHAPTER 114 The Gilder Pen-e-trat-ing fur-ther and fur-ther in-to the heart of the Ja-panese cruis-ing ground the Pe-quod was soon all astir in the fish-ery Often in mild pleas-ant weather for twelve fif-teen eigh-teen and twen-ty hours on the stretch they were en-gaged in the boats steadi-ly pulling or sail-ing or pad-dling after the whales or for an in-ter-lude of six-ty or seven-ty min-utes calm-ly await-ing their upris-ing though with but small suc-cess for their pains At such times un-der an abat-ed sun afloat all day upon smooth slow heav-ing swells seat-ed in his boat light as a birch ca-noe and so so-cia-bly mix-ing with the soft waves them-selves that like hearth stone cats they purr against the gun-wale th-ese are the times of dreamy qui-etude when be-hold-ing the tran-quil beau-ty and bril-lian-cy of the oceanâ s skin one for-gets the tiger heart that pan-ts be-neath it and would not willing-ly re-mem-ber that this velvet paw but con-ceals a re-morse-less fang Th-ese are the times when in his whale boat the rover soft-ly feels a cer-tain fil-ial con-fi-dent land like feel-ing towards the sea that he re-gards it as so much flow-ery earth and the dis-tant ship re-veal-ing on-ly the tops of her masts seems strug-gling for-ward not through high rolling waves but through the tall grass of a rolling prair-ie as when the western emi-grantsâ hors-es on-ly show their erect-ed ears while their hid-den bodies wide-ly wade through the amaz-ing ver-dure The long drawn vir-gin vales the mild blue hill sides as over th-ese there steals the hush the hum you al-most swear that play wearied chil-dren lie sleep-ing in th-ese soli-tudes in some glad May time when the flow-ers of the woods are plucked And all this mix-es with your most mys-tic mood so that fact and fan-cy half way meet-ing in-ter-pen-e-trate and form one seam-less whole Nor did such sooth-ing scenes how-ev-er tem-po-rary fail of at least as tem-po-rary an ef-fect on Ahab But if th-ese se-cret gold-en keys did seem to open in him his own se-cret gold-en trea-suries yet did his breath upon them prove but tar-nish-ing Oh grassy glades oh ever ver-nal end-less land-scapes in the soul in ye â though long parched by the dead drought of the earthy life â in ye men yet may roll like young hors-es in new morn-ing clover and for some few fleet-ing mo-men-ts feel the cool dew of the life im-mor-tal on them Would to God th-ese blessed calms would last But the min-gled min-gling threads of life are woven by warp and woof calms crossed by stor-ms a storm for every calm There is no steady un-re-trac-ing progress in this life we do not ad-vance through fixed gra-da-tions and at the last one pause â through in-fan-cyâ s un-con-scious spell boy-hoodâ s thought-less faith ado-les-cenceâ doubt the com-mon doom then scep-ti-cism then dis-be-lief rest-ing at last in man-hoodâ s pon-der-ing re-pose of If But once gone through we trace the round again and are in-fan-ts boys and men and Ifs eter-nal-ly Where lies the fi-nal har-bor whence we un-moor no more In what rapt ether sails the world of which the weari-est will nev-er weary Where is the foundlingâ s father hid-den Our souls are like those or-phans whose un-wed-ded mothers die in bear-ing them the se-cret of our pa-ter-ni-ty lies in their grave and we must there to learn it And that same day too gaz-ing far down from his boatâ s side in-to that same gold-en sea Star-buck low-ly mur-mured â â Love-li-ness un-fath-omable as ever lover saw in his young brideâ s eye â Tell me not of thy teeth tiered sharks and thy kid-nap-ping can-ni-bal ways Let faith oust fact let fan-cy oust me-mory I look deep down and do believe â And Stubb fish like with sparkling scales leaped up in that same gold-en light â â I am Stubb and Stubb has his his-to-ry but here Stubb takes oaths that he has al-ways been jol-ly â CHAPTER 115 The Pe-quod Meets The Bach-e-lor And jol-ly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bear-ing down be-fore the wind some few weeks after Ahabâ s har-poon had been weld-ed It was a Nan-tuck-et ship the Bach-e-lor which had just wedged in her last cask of oil and bolt-ed down her burst-ing hatch-es and now in glad hol-i-day ap-par-el was joy-ous-ly though some-what vain glo-ri-ous-ly sail-ing round among the wide-ly separat-ed ships on the ground pre-vi-ous to point-ing her prow for home The three men at her mast head wore long stream-ers of nar-row red bunt-ing at their hats from the stern a whale boat was sus-pend-ed bot-tom down and hang-ing cap-tive from the bowsprit was seen the long low-er jaw of the last whale they had slain Sig-nals en-signs and jacks of all colours were fly-ing from her rig-ging on every side Side-ways lashed in each of her three bas-ket-ed tops were two bar-rels of sperm above which in her top mast cross trees you saw slen-der break-ers of the same pre-cious flu-id and nailed to her main truck was a brazen lamp As was after-wards learned the Bach-e-lor had met with the most sur-pris-ing suc-cess all the more won-der-ful for that while cruis-ing in the same seas numer-ous other ves-sels had gone en-tire months without se-cur-ing a sin-gle fish Not on-ly had bar-rels of beef and bread been giv-en away to make room for the far more valu-able sperm but ad-di-tion-al sup-ple-men-tal casks had been bartered for from the ships she had met and th-ese were stowed along the deck and in the cap-tainâ s and of-fi-cer-sâ state rooms Even the cabin table it-self had been knocked in-to kin-dling wood and the cabin mess dined off the broad head of an oil butt lashed down to the floor for a cen-tre-piece In the fore-cas-tle the sailors had ac-tu-al-ly caulked and pitched their ch-ests and filled them it was hu-mor-ous-ly added that the cook had clapped a head on his largest boil-er and filled it that the ste-ward had plugged his spare cof-fee pot and filled it that the har-pooneers had head-ed the sock-ets of their irons and filled them that in-deed every-thing was filled with sperm ex-cept the cap-tainâ s pan-taloons pock-ets and those he re-served to thrust his hands in-to in self com-pla-cent tes-ti-mo-ny of his en-tire sat-is-fac-tion As this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody Pe-quod the bar-bar-ian sound of enor-mous drums came from her fore-cas-tle and draw-ing still nearer a crowd of her men were seen stand-ing round her huge try pots which covered with the parch-ment like poke or stomach skin of the black fish gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the clenched hands of the crew On the quar-ter deck the mates and har-pooneers were danc-ing with the olive hued gir-ls who had eloped with them from the Poly-ne-sian Isles while sus-pend-ed in an or-na-ment-ed boat firm-ly se-cured aloft between the fore-mast and main-mast three Long Is-land ne-groes with glit-ter-ing fid-dle bows of whale ivory were pre-sid-ing over the hi-lar-i-ous jig Mean-while others of the shipâ s com-pa-ny were tu-mul-tuous-ly busy at the ma-son-ry of the try works from which the huge pots had been re-moved You would have al-most thought they were pulling down the cursed Bastille such wild cries they raised as the now use-less brick and mor-tar were be-ing hurled in-to the sea Lord and master over all this scene the cap-tain stood erect on the shipâ s el-e-vat-ed quar-ter deck so that the whole re-joic-ing dra-ma was full be-fore him and seemed mere-ly con-trived for his own in-di-vid-u-al diver-sion And Ahab he too was stand-ing on his quar-ter deck shag-gy and black with a stub-born gloom and as the two ships crossed each otherâ s wakesâ one all ju-bi-la-tions for things passed the other all fore-bod-ings as to things to comeâ their two cap-tains in them-selves im-per-son-at-ed the whole strik-ing con-trast of the scene â Come aboard come aboard â cried the gay Bach-e-lorâ s com-man-der lift-ing a glass and a bot-tle in the air â Hast seen the White Whale â grit-ted Ahab in re-ply â No on-ly heard of him but donâ t believe in him at all â said the other good hu-mored-ly â Come aboard â â Thou art too damned jol-ly Sail on Hast lost any men â â Not enough to speak ofâ two is-lan-ders thatâ s all â but come aboard old hearty come along Iâ ll soon take that black from your brow Come along will ye mer-ryâ s the play a full ship and home-ward bound â â How won-drous fa-mil-iar is a fool â mut-tered Ahab then aloud â Thou art a full ship and home-ward bound thou sayst well then call me an emp-ty ship and out-ward bound So go thy ways and I will mine For-ward there Set all sail and keep her to the wind â And thus while the one ship went cheer-i-ly be-fore the breeze the other stub-born-ly fought against it and so the two ves-sels part-ed the crew of the Pe-quod look-ing with grave lin-ger-ing glances towards the re-ced-ing Bach-e-lor but the Bach-e-lorâ s men nev-er heed-ing their gaze for the live-ly revel-ry they were in And as Ahab lean-ing over the taf-frail eyed the home-ward bound craft he took from his pock-et a small vial of sand and then look-ing from the ship to the vial seemed there-by bring-ing two re-mote as-so-ci-a-tions to-geth-er for that vial was filled with Nan-tuck-et sound-ings CHAPTER 116 The Dy-ing Whale Not sel-dom in this life when on the right side for-tuneâ s favourites sail close by us we though all adroop be-fore catch some-what of the rush-ing breeze and joy-ful-ly feel our bag-ging sails fill out So seemed it with the Pe-quod For next day after en-coun-ter-ing the gay Bach-e-lor whales were seen and four were slain and one of them by Ahab It was far down the after-noon and when all the spear-ings of the crim-son fight were done and float-ing in the love-ly sun-set sea and sky sun and whale both stil-ly died to-geth-er then such a sweet-ness and such plain-tive-ness such in-wreath-ing orisons curled up in that rosy air that it al-most seemed as if far over from the deep green con-vent val-leys of the Manil-la isles the Span-ish land breeze wan-ton-ly turned sailor had gone to sea freight-ed with th-ese ves-per hym-ns Soothed again but on-ly soothed to deep-er gloom Ahab who had sterned off from the whale sat in-tent-ly watch-ing his fi-nal wan-ings from the now tran-quil boat For that strange spec-ta-cle ob-serv-able in all sperm whales dy-ingâ the turn-ing sun-wards of the head and so ex-pir-ingâ that strange spec-ta-cle be-held of such a placid even-ing some-how to Ahab con-veyed a won-drous-ness un-known be-fore â He turns and turns him to it â how slow-ly but how stead-fast-ly his ho-mage ren-der-ing and in-vok-ing brow with his last dy-ing mo-tions He too wor-ships fire most faith-ful broad ba-ro-nial vas-sal of the sun â Oh that th-ese too favour-ing eyes should see th-ese too favour-ing sights Look here far water locked beyond all hum of hu-man weal or woe in th-ese most can-did and im-par-tial seas where to tra-di-tions no rocks fur-nish tablets where for long Chi-nese ages the bil-lows have still rolled on speech-less and un-spo-ken to as stars that shine upon the Nigerâ s un-known source here too life dies sun-wards full of faith but see no soon-er dead than death whirls round the corpse and it heads some other way â Oh thou dark Hin-doo half of na-ture who of drowned bones hast build-ed thy separate throne some-where in the heart of th-ese un-ver-dured seas thou art an in-fi-del thou queen and too tru-ly speak-est to me in the wide slaugh-ter-ing Typhoon and the hushed buri-al of its after calm Nor has this thy whale sun-wards turned his dy-ing head and then gone round again without a les-son to me â Oh tre-bly hooped and weld-ed hip of pow-er Oh high aspir-ing rain-bowed jet â that one strivest this one jettest all in vain In vain oh whale dost thou seek in-ter-ced-ings with yon all quick-en-ing sun that on-ly cal-ls forth life but gives it not again Yet dost thou dark-er half rock me with a proud-er if a dark-er faith All thy un-nam-able im-min-glings float be-neath me here I am buoyed by breaths of once liv-ing things ex-haled as air but water now â Then hail for ever hail O sea in whose eter-nal toss-ings the wild fowl finds his on-ly rest Born of earth yet suck-led by the sea though hill and val-ley mothered me ye bil-lows are my foster brothers â CHAPTER 117 The Whale Watch The four whales slain that even-ing had died wide apart one far to wind-ward one less dis-tant to lee-ward one ahead one astern Th-ese last three were brought along-side ere night-fall but the wind-ward one could not be reached till morn-ing and the boat that had killed it lay by its side all night and that boat was Ahabâ s The waif pole was thrust upright in-to the dead whaleâ s spout hole and the lan-tern hang-ing from its top cast a trou-bled flick-er-ing glare upon the black glossy back and far out upon the mid-night waves which gent-ly chafed the whaleâ s broad flank like soft surf upon a beach Ahab and all his boatâ s crew seemed asleep but the Parsee who crouch-ing in the bow sat watch-ing the sharks that spec-tral-ly played round the whale and tapped the light cedar planks with their tails A sound like the moan-ing in squadrons over Asphaltites of un-for-giv-en ghosts of Go-mor-rah ran shud-der-ing through the air Start-ed from his slum-bers Ahab face to face saw the Parsee and hooped round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in a flood-ed world â I have dreamed it again â said he â Of the hears-es Have I not said old man that nei-ther hearse nor cof-fin can be thine â â And who are hearsed that die on the sea â â But I said old man that ere thou couldst die on this voy-age two hears-es must ver-i-ly be seen by thee on the sea the first not made by mor-tal hands and the vis-i-ble wood of the last one must be grown in Amer-i-ca â â Aye aye a strange sight that Parsee â a hearse and its plumes float-ing over the ocean with the waves for the pall bear-ers Ha Such a sight we shall not soon see â â Believe it or not thou canst not die till it be seen old man â â And what was that say-ing about thy-self â â Though it come to the last I shall still go be-fore thee thy pilot â â And when thou art so gone be-foreâ if that ever be-fal-lâ then ere I can fol-low thou must still ap-pear to me to pilot me still â Was it not so Well then did I believe all ye say oh my pilot I have here two pledges that I shall yet slay Mo-by Dick and sur-vive it â â Take another pledge old man â said the Parsee as his eyes light-ed up like fire flies in the gloomâ â Hemp on-ly can kill thee â â The gal-lows ye mean â I am im-mor-tal then on land and on sea â cried Ahab with a laugh of deri-sion â â Im-mor-tal on land and on sea â Both were si-lent again as one man The grey dawn came on and the slum-ber-ing crew arose from the boatâ s bot-tom and ere noon the dead whale was brought to the ship CHAPTER 118 The Quad-rant The sea-son for the Line at length drew near and every day when Ahab com-ing from his cabin cast his eyes aloft the vig-i-lant helms-man would os-ten-ta-tious-ly han-dle his spokes and the eager mariners quick-ly run to the braces and would stand there with all their eyes cen-tral-ly fixed on the nailed dou-bloon im-pa-tient for the order to point the shipâ s prow for the equa-tor In good time the order came It was hard upon high noon and Ahab seat-ed in the bows of his high hoist-ed boat was about tak-ing his wont-ed dai-ly ob-ser-va-tion of the sun to deter-mine his lat-i-tude Now in that Ja-panese sea the days in sum-mer are as freshets of ef-ful-gences That un-blink-ing-ly vivid Ja-panese sun seems the blaz-ing fo-cus of the glassy oceanâ s im-mea-sur-able burn-ing glass The sky looks lac-quered clouds there are none the hori-zon floats and this naked-ness of un-re-lieved ra-di-ance is as the in-suf-fer-able splen-dors of Godâ s throne Well that Ahabâ s quad-rant was fur-nished with coloured glass-es through which to take sight of that so-lar fire So swing-ing his seat-ed form to the roll of the ship and with his astro-log-i-cal look-ing in-stru-ment placed to his eye he re-mained in that pos-ture for some mo-men-ts to catch the pre-cise in-stant when the sun should gain its pre-cise merid-i-an Mean-time while his whole at-ten-tion was ab-sorbed the Parsee was kneel-ing be-neath him on the shipâ s deck and with face thrown up like Ahabâ s was eye-ing the same sun with him on-ly the lids of his eyes half hood-ed their or-bs and his wild face was sub-dued to an earth-ly pas-sion-less-ness At length the de-sired ob-ser-va-tion was tak-en and with his pen-cil upon his ivory leg Ahab soon cal-cu-lat-ed what his lat-i-tude must be at that pre-cise in-stant Then falling in-to a mo-men-tâ s rev-ery he again looked up towards the sun and mur-mured to him-self â Thou sea mark thou high and mighty Pilot thou tellest me tru-ly where I am â but canst thou cast the least hint where I shall be Or canst thou tell where some other thing be-sides me is this mo-ment liv-ing Where is Mo-by Dick This in-stant thou must be eye-ing him Th-ese eyes of mine look in-to the very eye that is even now be-hold-ing him aye and in-to the eye that is even now equal-ly be-hold-ing the ob-jec-ts on the un-known thith-er side of thee thou sun â Then gaz-ing at his quad-rant and han-dling one after the other its numer-ous ca-bal-is-ti-cal con-trivances he pon-dered again and mut-tered â Fool-ish toy ba-biesâ play-thing of haughty Ad-mi-rals and Com-modores and Cap-tains the world brags of thee of thy cun-ning and might but what after all canst thou do but tell the poor pi-ti-ful point where thou thy-self hap-pen-est to be on this wide plan-et and the hand that holds thee no not one jot more Thou canst not tell where one drop of water or one grain of sand will be to mor-row noon and yet with thy im-po-tence thou in-sul-test the sun Science Curse thee thou vain toy and cursed be all the things that cast manâ s eyes aloft to that heav-en whose live vivid-ness but scorch-es him as th-ese old eyes are even now scorched with thy light O sun Lev-el by na-ture to this earthâ s hori-zon are the glances of manâ s eyes not shot from the crown of his head as if God had meant him to gaze on his fir-ma-ment Curse thee thou quad-rant â dash-ing it to the deck â no longer will I guide my earth-ly way by thee the lev-el shipâ s com-pass and the lev-el dead reck-on-ing by log and by line th-ese shall con-duct me and show me my place on the sea Aye â light-ing from the boat to the deck â thus I tram-ple on thee thou pal-try thing that fee-bly poin-test on high thus I split and de-stroy thee â As the fran-tic old man thus spoke and thus tram-pled with his live and dead feet a sneer-ing tri-umph that seemed meant for Ahab and a fatal-is-tic de-s-pair that seemed meant for him-selfâ th-ese passed over the mute mo-tion-less Parseeâ s face Unob-served he rose and glid-ed away while awestruck by the aspect of their com-man-der the sea-men clus-tered to-geth-er on the fore-cas-tle till Ahab trou-bled-ly pac-ing the deck shout-ed outâ â To the braces Up helm â square in â In an in-stant the yards swung round and as the ship half wheeled upon her heel her three firm seat-ed grace-ful masts erect-ly poised upon her long ribbed hull seemed as the three Ho-ratii pirou-et-ting on one suf-fi-cient steed Stand-ing between the knight heads Star-buck watched the Pe-quodâ s tu-mul-tuous way and Ahabâ s al-so as he went lurch-ing along the deck â I have sat be-fore the dense coal fire and watched it all aglow full of its tor-ment-ed flam-ing life and I have seen it wane at last down down to dumbest dust Old man of oceans of all this fiery life of thine what will at length re-main but one lit-tle heap of ash-es â â Aye â cried Stubb â but sea coal ash-esâ mind ye that Mr Star-buckâ sea coal not your com-mon char-coal Well well I heard Ahab mut-ter â Here some one thrusts th-ese cards in-to th-ese old hands of mine swears that I must play them and no others â And damn me Ahab but thou actest right live in the game and die in it â CHAPTER 119 The Can-dles Warmest climes but nurse the cru-ellest fangs the tiger of Ben-gal crouch-es in spiced groves of cease-less ver-dure Skies the most ef-ful-gent but bas-ket the dead-li-est thun-ders gor-geous Cu-ba knows tor-na-does that nev-er swept tame north-ern lands So too it is that in th-ese re-s-plen-dent Ja-panese seas the mariner en-coun-ters the direst of all stor-ms the Typhoon It will some-times burst from out that cloud-less sky like an ex-plod-ing bomb upon a dazed and sleepy town Towards even-ing of that day the Pe-quod was torn of her can-vas and bare poled was left to fight a Typhoon which had struck her direct-ly ahead When dark-ness came on sky and sea roared and split with the thun-der and blazed with the light-ning that showed the dis-abled masts flut-ter-ing here and there with the rags which the first fury of the tem-pest had left for its after sport Hold-ing by a shroud Star-buck was stand-ing on the quar-ter deck at every flash of the light-ning glanc-ing aloft to see what ad-di-tion-al disas-ter might have be-fall-en the in-tri-cate ham-per there while Stubb and Flask were direct-ing the men in the higher hoist-ing and firmer lash-ing of the boats But all their pains seemed naught Though lift-ed to the very top of the cranes the wind-ward quar-ter boat Ahabâ s did not es-cape A great rolling sea dash-ing high up against the reel-ing shipâ s high tee-ter-ing side stove in the boatâ s bot-tom at the stern and left it again all drip-ping through like a sieve â Bad work bad work Mr Star-buck â said Stubb re-gard-ing the wreck â but the sea will have its way Stubb for one canâ t fight it You see Mr Star-buck a wave has such a great long start be-fore it leaps all round the world it runs and then comes the spring But as for me all the start I have to meet it is just across the deck here But nev-er mind itâ s all in fun so the old song says â â sings Oh jol-ly is the gale And a jok-er is the whale Aâ flour-ish-inâ his tail â Such a fun-ny sporty gamy jesty joky hoky poky lad is the Ocean oh The scud all a fly-inâ Thatâ s his flip on-ly foam-inâ When he stirs in the spicinâ â Such a fun-ny sporty gamy jesty joky hoky poky lad is the Ocean oh Thun-der splits the ships But he on-ly smacks his lips A tastinâ of this flip â Such a fun-ny sporty gamy jesty joky hoky poky lad is the Ocean oh â Avast Stubb â cried Star-buck â let the Typhoon sing and strike his harp here in our rig-ging but if thou art a brave man thou wilt hold thy peace â â But I am not a brave man nev-er said I was a brave man I am a coward and I sing to keep up my spir-its And I tell you what it is Mr Star-buck thereâ s no way to stop my sing-ing in this world but to cut my throat And when thatâ s done ten to one I sing ye the dox-ol-o-gy for a wind up â â Mad-man look through my eyes if thou hast none of thine own â â What how can you see bet-ter of a dark night than any-body else nev-er mind how fool-ish â â Here â cried Star-buck seiz-ing Stubb by the shoul-der and point-ing his hand towards the weather bow â mark-est thou not that the gale comes from the east-ward the very course Ahab is to run for Mo-by Dick the very course he swung to this day noon now mark his boat there where is that stove In the stern sheets man where he is wont to standâ his stand point is stove man Now jump over-board and sing away if thou must â I donâ t half un-der-stand ye whatâ s in the wind â â Yes yes round the Cape of Good Hope is the short-est way to Nan-tuck-et â so-lil-o-quized Star-buck sud-den-ly heed-less of Stub-bâ s ques-tion â The gale that now ham-mers at us to stave us we can turn it in-to a fair wind that will drive us towards home Yon-der to wind-ward all is black-ness of doom but to lee-ward home-wardâ I see it light-ens up there but not with the light-ning â At that mo-ment in one of the in-ter-vals of pro-found dark-ness fol-low-ing the flash-es a voice was heard at his side and al-most at the same in-stant a vol-ley of thun-der peals rolled over-head â Whoâ s there â â Old Thun-der â said Ahab grop-ing his way along the bul-warks to his piv-ot hole but sud-den-ly find-ing his path made plain to him by el-bowed lances of fire Now as the light-ning rod to a spire on shore is in-tend-ed to car-ry off the per-ilous flu-id in-to the soil so the kin-dred rod which at sea some ships car-ry to each mast is in-tend-ed to con-duct it in-to the water But as this con-duc-tor must descend to con-sid-er-able depth that its end may avoid all con-tact with the hull and as more-over if kept con-stant-ly tow-ing there it would be li-able to many mishaps be-sides in-ter-fer-ing not a lit-tle with some of the rig-ging and more or less im-ped-ing the ves-selâ s way in the water be-cause of all this the low-er parts of a shipâ s light-ning rods are not al-ways over-board but are gen-er-al-ly made in long slen-der links so as to be the more read-i-ly hauled up in-to the chains out-side or thrown down in-to the sea as oc-ca-sion may re-quire â The rods the rods â cried Star-buck to the crew sud-den-ly ad-mon-ished to vig-i-lance by the vivid light-ning that had just been dart-ing flam-beaux to light Ahab to his post â Are they over-board drop them over fore and aft Quick â â Avast â cried Ahab â letâ s have fair play here though we be the weak-er side Yet Iâ ll con-tribute to raise rods on the Him-male-hs and An-des that all the world may be se-cured but out on priv-i-leges Let them be sir â â Look aloft â cried Star-buck â The cor-pu-san-ts the cor-pu-san-ts â All the yard ar-ms were tipped with a pal-lid fire and touched at each tri point-ed light-ning rod end with three taper-ing white flames each of the three tall masts was si-lent-ly burn-ing in that sul-phurous air like three gi-gan-tic wax tapers be-fore an al-tar â Blast the boat let it go â cried Stubb at this in-stant as a swash-ing sea heaved up un-der his own lit-tle craft so that its gun-wale vi-o-lent-ly jammed his hand as he was pass-ing a lash-ing â Blast it â â but slip-ping back-ward on the deck his uplift-ed eyes caught the flames and im-me-di-ate-ly shift-ing his tone he criedâ â The cor-pu-san-ts have mer-cy on us all â To sailors oaths are house-hold words they will swear in the trance of the calm and in the teeth of the tem-pest they will im-pre-cate curs-es from the top-sail yard ar-ms when most they teeter over to a seething sea but in all my voy-ag-ings sel-dom have I heard a com-mon oath when Godâ s burn-ing finger has been laid on the ship when His â Mene Mene Tekel Upharsinâ has been woven in-to the shrouds and the cordage While this pal-lid-ness was burn-ing aloft few words were heard from the en-chant-ed crew who in one thick clus-ter stood on the fore-cas-tle all their eyes gleam-ing in that pale phos-pho-res-cence like a far away con-stel-la-tion of stars Relieved against the ghost-ly light the gi-gan-tic jet ne-gro Dag-goo loomed up to thrice his real stature and seemed the black cloud from which the thun-der had come The part-ed mouth of Tashtego re-vealed his shark white teeth which strange-ly gleamed as if they too had been tipped by cor-pu-san-ts while lit up by the preter-nat-u-ral light Quee-quegâ s tat-too-ing burned like Satan-ic blue flames on his body The tableau all waned at last with the pal-lid-ness aloft and once more the Pe-quod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall A mo-ment or two passed when Star-buck go-ing for-ward pushed against some one It was Stubb â What think-est thou now man I heard thy cry it was not the same in the song â â No no it was-nâ t I said the cor-pu-san-ts have mer-cy on us all and I hope they will still But do they on-ly have mer-cy on long faces â have they no bow-els for a laugh And look ye Mr Star-buckâ but itâ s too dark to look Hear me then I take that mast head flame we saw for a sign of good luck for those masts are root-ed in a hold that is go-ing to be chock aâ block with sperm oil dâ ye see and so all that sperm will work up in-to the masts like sap in a tree Yes our three masts will yet be as three sper-ma-ceti can-dlesâ thatâ s the good promise we saw â At that mo-ment Star-buck caught sight of Stub-bâ s face slow-ly begin-ning to glim-mer in-to sight Glanc-ing up-wards he cried â See see â and once more the high taper-ing flames were be-held with what seemed re-dou-bled su-per-nat-u-ral-ness in their pal-lor â The cor-pu-san-ts have mer-cy on us all â cried Stubb again At the base of the main-mast full be-neath the dou-bloon and the flame the Parsee was kneel-ing in Ahabâ s front but with his head bowed away from him while near by from the arched and over-hang-ing rig-ging where they had just been en-gaged se-cur-ing a spar a num-ber of the sea-men ar-rest-ed by the glare now co-hered to-geth-er and hung pen-du-lous like a knot of numbed wasps from a droop-ing or-chard twig In var-i-ous en-chant-ed at-ti-tudes like the stand-ing or step-ping or run-ning skele-tons in Her-cu-la-neum others re-mained root-ed to the deck but all their eyes up-cast â Aye aye men â cried Ahab â Look up at it mark it well the white flame but lights the way to the White Whale Hand me those main-mast links there I would fain feel this pulse and let mine beat against it blood against fire So â Then turn-ingâ the last link held fast in his left hand he put his foot upon the Parsee and with fixed up-ward eye and high flung right arm he stood erect be-fore the lofty tri point-ed trin-i-ty of flames â Oh thou clear spir-it of clear fire whom on th-ese seas I as Per-sian once did wor-ship till in the sacra-men-tal act so burned by thee that to this hour I bear the scar I now know thee thou clear spir-it and I now know that thy right wor-ship is de-fi-ance To nei-ther love nor rev-er-ence wilt thou be kind and eâ en for hate thou canst but kill and all are killed No fear-less fool now fron-ts thee I own thy speech-less place-less pow-er but to the last gasp of my earthquake life will dis-pute its un-con-di-tion-al un-in-te-gral mastery in me In the midst of the per-son-i-fied im-per-son-al a per-son-al-i-ty stands here Though but a point at best whence-soeâ er I came where-soeâ er I go yet while I earth-ly live the queen-ly per-son-al-i-ty lives in me and feels her roy-al rights But war is pain and hate is woe Come in thy low-est form of love and I will kneel and kiss thee but at thy high-est come as mere su-per-nal pow-er and though thou launch-est navies of full freight-ed worlds thereâ s that in here that still re-mains in-dif-fer-ent Oh thou clear spir-it of thy fire thou madest me and like a true child of fire I breathe it back to thee â Sud-den re-peat-ed flash-es of light-ning the nine flames leap length-wise to thrice their pre-vi-ous height Ahab with the rest clos-es his eyes his right hand pressed hard upon them â I own thy speech-less place-less pow-er said I not so Nor was it wrung from me nor do I now drop th-ese links Thou canst blind but I can then grope Thou canst con-sume but I can then be ash-es Take the ho-mage of th-ese poor eyes and shut-ter hands I would not take it The light-ning flash-es through my skull mine eye bal-ls ache and ache my whole beat-en brain seems as be-head-ed and rolling on some stun-ning ground Oh oh Yet blind-fold yet will I talk to thee Light though thou be thou leapest out of dark-ness but I am dark-ness leap-ing out of light leap-ing out of thee The javelins cease open eyes see or not There burn the flames Oh thou mag-nan-i-mous now I do glo-ry in my ge-neal-o-gy But thou art but my fiery father my sweet mother I know not Oh cru-el what hast thou done with her There lies my puz-zle but thine is greater Thou know-est not how came ye hence callest thy-self un-be-got-ten cer-tain-ly know-est not thy begin-ning hence callest thy-self un-be-gun I know that of me which thou know-est not of thy-self oh thou om-nipo-tent There is some un-suf-fus-ing thing beyond thee thou clear spir-it to whom all thy eter-ni-ty is but time all thy creative-ness me-chan-i-cal Through thee thy flam-ing self my scorched eyes do dim-ly see it Oh thou foundling fire thou her-mit im-memo-ri-al thou too hast thy in-com-mu-ni-ca-ble rid-dle thy un-par-tic-i-pat-ed grief Here again with haughty agony I read my sire Leap leap up and lick the sky I leap with thee I burn with thee would fain be weld-ed with thee de-fy-ing-ly I wor-ship thee â â The boat the boat â cried Star-buck â look at thy boat old man â Ahabâ s har-poon the one forged at Perthâ s fire re-mained firm-ly lashed in its con-spic-u-ous crotch so that it pro-ject-ed beyond his whale boatâ s bow but the sea that had stove its bot-tom had caused the loose leather sheath to drop off and from the keen steel barb there now came a lev-elled flame of pale forked fire As the si-lent har-poon burned there like a ser-pen-tâ s tongue Star-buck grasped Ahab by the ar-mâ â God God is against thee old man for-bear â tis an ill voy-age ill be-gun ill con-tin-ued let me square the yards while we may old man and make a fair wind of it home-wards to go on a bet-ter voy-age than this â Over-hear-ing Star-buck the pan-ic strick-en crew in-stant-ly ran to the bracesâ though not a sail was left aloft For the mo-ment all the aghast mateâ s thoughts seemed theirs they raised a half muti-nous cry But dash-ing the rat-tling light-ning links to the deck and snatch-ing the burn-ing har-poon Ahab waved it like a torch among them swear-ing to trans-fix with it the first sailor that but cast loose a ropeâ s end Pet-ri-fied by his aspect and still more shrink-ing from the fiery dart that he held the men fell back in dis-may and Ahab again spoke â â All your oaths to hunt the White Whale are as bind-ing as mine and heart soul and body lungs and life old Ahab is bound And that ye may know to what tune this heart beats look ye here thus I blow out the last fear â And with one blast of his breath he ex-tin-guished the flame As in the hur-ri-cane that sweeps the plain men fly the neigh-bor-hood of some lone gi-gan-tic elm whose very height and strength but ren-der it so much the more un-safe be-cause so much the more a mark for thun-der-bolts so at those last words of Ahabâ s many of the mariners did run from him in a ter-ror of dis-may CHAPTER 12 The Deck Towards the End of the First Night Watch Ahab stand-ing by the helm Star-buck ap-proach-ing him â We must send down the main top sail yard sir The band is work-ing loose and the lee lift is half strand-ed Shall I strike it sir â â Strike noth-ing lash it If I had sky sail poles Iâ d sway them up now â â Sir â in Godâ s name â sir â â Well â â The an-chors are work-ing sir Shall I get them in-board â â Strike noth-ing and stir noth-ing but lash every-thing The wind ris-es but it has not got up to my table lands yet Quick and see to it â By masts and keels he takes me for the hunch backed skip-per of some coast-ing smack Send down my main top sail yard Ho glue-pots Lofti-est trucks were made for wildest winds and this brain truck of mine now sails amid the cloud scud Shall I strike that Oh none but cowards send down their brain trucks in tem-pest time What a hooroosh aloft there I would eâ en take it for sublime did I not know that the colic is a noisy mal-a-dy Oh take medicine take medicine â CHAPTER 121 Mid-night â The Fore-cas-tle Bul-warks Stubb and Flask mount-ed on them and pass-ing ad-di-tion-al lash-ings over the an-chors there hang-ing â No Stubb you may pound that knot there as much as you please but you will nev-er pound in-to me what you were just now say-ing And how long ago is it since you said the very con-trary Did-nâ t you once say that what-ev-er ship Ahab sails in that ship should pay some-thing ex-tra on its in-surance pol-i-cy just as though it were load-ed with pow-der bar-rels aft and box-es of lu-cifers for-ward Stop now did-nâ t you say so â â Well sup-pose I did What then Iâ ve part changed my flesh since that time why not my mind Be-sides sup-pos-ing we are load-ed with pow-der bar-rels aft and lu-cifers for-ward how the devil could the lu-cifers get afire in this drench-ing spray here Why my lit-tle man you have pret-ty red hair but you could-nâ t get afire now Shake your-self youâ re Aquar-ius or the water bearer Flask might fill pitch-ers at your coat col-lar Donâ t you see then that for th-ese ex-tra risks the Marine In-surance com-pa-nies have ex-tra guar-an-tees Here are hy-dran-ts Flask But hark again and Iâ ll an-swer ye the other thing First take your leg off from the crown of the an-chor here though so I can pass the rope now lis-ten Whatâ s the mighty dif-fer-ence between hold-ing a mastâ s light-ning rod in the storm and stand-ing close by a mast that has-nâ t got any light-ning rod at all in a storm Donâ t you see you tim-ber head that no harm can come to the hold-er of the rod un-less the mast is first struck What are you talk-ing about then Not one ship in a hun-dred car-ries rods and Ahab â aye man and all of us â were in no more danger then in my poor opin-ion than all the crews in ten thou-sand ships now sail-ing the seas Why you King Post you I sup-pose you would have every man in the world go about with a small light-ning rod run-ning up the corner of his hat like a mili-tia of-fi-cerâ s skew-ered feather and trail-ing be-hind like his sash Why donâ t ye be sen-si-ble Flask itâ s easy to be sen-si-ble why donâ t ye then any man with half an eye can be sen-si-ble â â I donâ t know that Stubb You some-times find it rather hard â â Yes when a fel-lowâ s soaked through itâ s hard to be sen-si-ble thatâ s a fact And I am about drenched with this spray Nev-er mind catch the turn there and pass it Seems to me we are lash-ing down th-ese an-chors now as if they were nev-er go-ing to be used again Ty-ing th-ese two an-chors here Flask seems like ty-ing a manâ s hands be-hind him And what big gen-er-ous hands they are to be sure Th-ese are your iron fists hey What a hold they have too I won-der Flask whether the world is an-chored any-where if she is she swings with an un-com-mon long cable though There ham-mer that knot down and weâ ve done So next to touch-ing land light-ing on deck is the most sat-is-fac-to-ry I say just wring out my jack-et skirts will ye Thank ye They laugh at long togs so Flask but seems to me a long tailed coat ought al-ways to be worn in all stor-ms afloat The tails taper-ing down that way serve to car-ry off the water dâ ye see Same with cocked hats the cocks form gable end eave troughs Flask No more mon-key jack-ets and tarpaulins for me I must mount a swal-low tail and drive down a beaver so Hal-loa whew there goes my tarpaulin over-board Lord Lord that the winds that come from heav-en should be so un-man-ner-ly This is a nasty night lad â CHAPTER 122 Mid-night Aloft â Thun-der and Light-ning The main top sail yard â Tashtego pass-ing new lash-ings around it â Um um um Stop that thun-der Plen-ty too much thun-der up here Whatâ s the use of thun-der Um um um We donâ t want thun-der we want rum give us a glass of rum Um um um â CHAPTER 123 The Mus-ket Dur-ing the most vi-o-lent shocks of the Typhoon the man at the Pe-quodâ s jaw bone tiller had sev-er-al times been reel-ing-ly hurled to the deck by its spas-mod-ic mo-tions even though preven-ter tack-les had been at-tached to itâ for they were slackâ be-cause some play to the tiller was indis-pens-able In a se-vere gale like this while the ship is but a tossed shut-tle-cock to the blast it is by no means un-com-mon to see the nee-dles in the com-pass-es at in-ter-vals go round and round It was thus with the Pe-quodâ s at al-most every shock the helms-man had not failed to no-tice the whirling ve-loc-i-ty with which they re-volved upon the cards it is a sight that hard-ly any-one can be-hold without some sort of un-wont-ed emo-tion Some hours after mid-night the Typhoon abat-ed so much that through the stren-u-ous ex-er-tions of Star-buck and Stub-bâ one en-gaged for-ward and the other aftâ the shivered rem-nan-ts of the jib and fore and main top sails were cut adrift from the spars and went ed-dy-ing away to lee-ward like the feathers of an al-ba-tross which some-times are cast to the winds when that storm tossed bird is on the wing The three cor-re-spond-ing new sails were now bent and reefed and a storm try-sail was set fur-ther aft so that the ship soon went through the water with some pre-ci-sion again and the courseâ for the pre-sent East south eastâ which he was to steer if prac-ti-ca-ble was once more giv-en to the helms-man For dur-ing the vi-o-lence of the gale he had on-ly steered ac-cord-ing to its vi-cis-si-tudes But as he was now bring-ing the ship as near her course as pos-si-ble watch-ing the com-pass mean-while lo a good sign the wind seemed com-ing round astern aye the foul breeze be-came fair In-stant-ly the yards were squared to the live-ly song of â Ho the fair wind oh ye ho cheer-ly men â the crew sing-ing for joy that so promis-ing an event should so soon have fal-si-fied the evil por-ten-ts pre-ced-ing it In com-pli-ance with the stand-ing order of his com-man-derâ to re-port im-me-di-ate-ly and at any one of the twen-ty four hours any de-cid-ed change in the af-fairs of the deck â Star-buck had no soon-er trimmed the yards to the breezeâ how-ev-er reluc-tant-ly and gloomi-ly â than he me-chan-i-cal-ly went below to ap-prise Cap-tain Ahab of the cir-cum-stance Ere knock-ing at his state room he in-vol-un-tar-i-ly paused be-fore it a mo-ment The cabin lam-pâ tak-ing long swings this way and thatâ was burn-ing fit-ful-ly and cast-ing fit-ful shad-ows upon the old manâ s bolt-ed door â a thin one with fixed blinds insert-ed in place of up-per panels The iso-lat-ed subter-ra-ne-ous-ness of the cabin made a cer-tain hum-ming si-lence to reign there though it was hooped round by all the roar of the ele-men-ts The load-ed mus-kets in the rack were shin-ing-ly re-vealed as they stood upright against the for-ward bulk-head Star-buck was an hon-est upright man but out of Star-buckâ s heart at that in-stant when he saw the mus-kets there strange-ly evolved an evil thought but so blent with its neu-tral or good ac-com-pa-ni-men-ts that for the in-stant he hard-ly knew it for it-self â He would have shot me once â he mur-mured â yes thereâ s the very mus-ket that he point-ed at me â that one with the stud-ded stock let me touch itâ lift it Strange that I who have han-dled so many dead-ly lances strange that I should shake so now Load-ed I must see Aye aye and pow-der in the pan â thatâ s not good Best spill it â wait Iâ ll cure my-self of this Iâ ll hold the mus-ket bold-ly while I think â I come to re-port a fair wind to him But how fair Fair for death and doom â thatâ s fair for Mo-by Dick Itâ s a fair wind thatâ s on-ly fair for that ac-cursed fish â The very tube he point-ed at me â the very one this oneâ I hold it here he would have killed me with the very thing I han-dle now â Aye and he would fain kill all his crew Does he not say he will not strike his spars to any gale Has he not dashed his heav-en-ly quad-rant and in th-ese same per-ilous seas gropes he not his way by mere dead reck-on-ing of the er-ror abound-ing log and in this very Typhoon did he not swear that he would have no light-ning rods But shall this crazed old man be tame-ly suf-fered to drag a whole shipâ s com-pa-ny down to doom with him â Yes it would make him the wil-ful mur-derer of thir-ty men and more if this ship come to any dead-ly harm and come to dead-ly harm my soul swears this ship will if Ahab have his way If then he were this in-stan-tâ put aside that crime would not be his Ha is he mut-ter-ing in his sleep Yes just there â in there heâ s sleep-ing Sleep-ing aye but still alive and soon awake again I canâ t with-stand thee then old man Not rea-son-ing not re-mon-strance not en-treaty wilt thou hear-ken to all this thou scornest Flat obe-di-ence to thy own flat com-mands this is all thou breathest Aye and sayâ st the men have vowâ d thy vow sayâ st all of us are Ahabs Great God for-bid â But is there no other way no law-ful way â Make him a prison-er to be tak-en home What hope to wrest this old manâ s liv-ing pow-er from his own liv-ing hands On-ly a fool would try it Say he were pin-ioned even knot-ted all over with ropes and hawsers chained down to ring bolts on this cabin floor he would be more hideous than a caged tiger then I could not en-dure the sight could not pos-si-bly fly his howl-ings all com-fort sleep it-self ines-timable rea-son would leave me on the long in-tol-er-a-ble voy-age What then re-mains The land is hun-dreds of leagues away and locked Ja-pan the near-est I stand alone here upon an open sea with two oceans and a whole con-ti-nent between me and law â Aye aye â tis so â Is heav-en a mur-derer when its light-ning strikes a would be mur-derer in his bed tin-der-ing sheets and skin to-geth-er â And would I be a mur-derer then ifâ â and slow-ly stealthi-ly and half side-ways look-ing he placed the load-ed mus-ketâ s end against the door â On this lev-el Ahabâ s ham-mock swings within his head this way A touch and Star-buck may sur-vive to hug his wife and child again â Oh Mary Mary â boy boy boy â But if I wake thee not to death old man who can tell to what un-sound-ed deeps Star-buckâ s body this day week may sink with all the crew Great God where art Thou Shall I shall I â The wind has gone down and shift-ed sir the fore and main top-sails are reefed and set she heads her course â â Stern all Oh Mo-by Dick I clutch thy heart at last â Such were the sounds that now came hurtling from out the old manâ s tor-ment-ed sleep as if Star-buckâ s voice had caused the long dumb dream to speak The yet lev-elled mus-ket shook like a drunk-ardâ s arm against the panel Star-buck seemed wrestling with an an-gel but turn-ing from the door he placed the death tube in its rack and left the place â Heâ s too sound asleep Mr Stubb go thou down and wake him and tell him I must see to the deck here Thou knowâ st what to say â CHAPTER 124 The Nee-dle Next morn-ing the not yet sub-sid-ed sea rolled in long slow bil-lows of mighty bulk and striv-ing in the Pe-quodâ s gur-gling track pushed her on like giantsâ palms out-spread The strong un-stag-ger-ing breeze abound-ed so that sky and air seemed vast out-bel-ly-ing sails the whole world boomed be-fore the wind Muf-fled in the full morn-ing light the in-vis-i-ble sun was on-ly known by the spread in-ten-si-ty of his place where his bay-o-net rays moved on in stacks Em-bla-zon-ings as of crowned Baby-lo-ni-an kings and queens reigned over every-thing The sea was as a cru-cible of molten gold that bub-bling-ly leaps with light and heat Long main-tain-ing an en-chant-ed si-lence Ahab stood apart and every time the te-ter-ing ship low-er-ing-ly pitched down her bowsprit he turned to eye the bright sunâ s rays pro-duced ahead and when she pro-found-ly set-tled by the stern he turned be-hind and saw the sunâ s rear-ward place and how the same yel-low rays were blend-ing with his un-de-vi-at-ing wake â Ha ha my ship thou might-est well be tak-en now for the sea char-i-ot of the sun Ho ho all ye na-tions be-fore my prow I bring the sun to ye Yoke on the fur-ther bil-lows hal-lo a tan-dem I drive the sea â But sud-den-ly reined back by some counter thought he hur-ried towards the helm huski-ly de-mand-ing how the ship was head-ing â East sou east sir â said the fright-ened steers-man â Thou li-est â smit-ing him with his clenched fist â Head-ing East at this hour in the morn-ing and the sun astern â Upon this every soul was con-found-ed for the phenomenon just then ob-served by Ahab had unac-count-ably es-caped every one else but its very blind-ing pal-pa-ble-ness must have been the cause Thrust-ing his head half way in-to the bin-na-cle Ahab caught one glimpse of the com-pass-es his uplift-ed arm slow-ly fell for a mo-ment he al-most seemed to stag-ger Stand-ing be-hind him Star-buck looked and lo the two com-pass-es point-ed East and the Pe-quod was as in-fal-li-bly go-ing West But ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew the old man with a rigid laugh ex-claimed â I have it It has hap-pened be-fore Mr Star-buck last nightâ s thun-der turned our com-pass-esâ thatâ s all Thou hast be-fore now heard of such a thing I take it â â Aye but nev-er be-fore has it hap-pened to me sir â said the pale mate gloomi-ly Here it must needs be said that ac-ci-den-ts like this have in more than one case oc-curred to ships in vi-o-lent stor-ms The mag-net-ic en-er-gy as devel-oped in the marinerâ s nee-dle is as all know essen-tial-ly one with the elec-tric-i-ty be-held in heav-en hence it is not to be much marvelled at that such things should be In-stances where the light-ning has ac-tu-al-ly struck the ves-sel so as to smite down some of the spars and rig-ging the ef-fect upon the nee-dle has at times been still more fatal all its load-stone virtue be-ing an-ni-hi-lat-ed so that the be-fore mag-net-ic steel was of no more use than an old wifeâ s knit-ting nee-dle But in either case the nee-dle nev-er again of it-self re-cov-ers the orig-i-nal virtue thus marred or lost and if the bin-na-cle com-pass-es be af-fect-ed the same fate reach-es all the others that may be in the ship even were the low-er-most one insert-ed in-to the kel-son De-lib-er-ate-ly stand-ing be-fore the bin-na-cle and eye-ing the trans-point-ed com-pass-es the old man with the sharp of his ex-tend-ed hand now took the pre-cise bear-ing of the sun and sat-is-fied that the nee-dles were ex-act-ly in-vert-ed shout-ed out his orders for the shipâ s course to be changed ac-cord-ing-ly The yards were hard up and once more the Pe-quod thrust her un-daunt-ed bows in-to the op-pos-ing wind for the sup-posed fair one had on-ly been jug-gling her Mean-while what-ev-er were his own se-cret thoughts Star-buck said noth-ing but qui-et-ly he is-sued all req-ui-site orders while Stubb and Flaskâ who in some small de-gree seemed then to be shar-ing his feel-ingsâ like-wise un-mur-mur-ing-ly ac-qui-esced As for the men though some of them low-ly rum-bled their fear of Ahab was greater than their fear of Fate But as ever be-fore the pa-gan har-pooneers re-mained al-most whol-ly un-im-pressed or if im-pressed it was on-ly with a cer-tain mag-netism shot in-to their con-ge-nial hearts from in-flex-i-ble Ahabâ s For a space the old man walked the deck in rolling rev-er-ies But chanc-ing to slip with his ivory heel he saw the crushed cop-per sight tubes of the quad-rant he had the day be-fore dashed to the deck â Thou poor proud heav-en gaz-er and sunâ s pilot yes-ter-day I wrecked thee and to day the com-pass-es would fain have wrecked me So so But Ahab is lord over the lev-el load-stone yet Mr Star-buckâ a lance without a pole a top maul and the smallest of the sail mak-erâ s nee-dles Quick â Ac-ces-so-ry per-haps to the im-pulse dic-tat-ing the thing he was now about to do were cer-tain pru-den-tial mo-tives whose ob-ject might have been to re-vive the spir-its of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill in a mat-ter so won-drous as that of the in-vert-ed com-pass-es Be-sides the old man well knew that to steer by trans-point-ed nee-dles though clum-si-ly prac-ti-ca-ble was not a thing to be passed over by su-per-sti-tious sailors without some shud-der-ings and evil por-ten-ts â Men â said he steadi-ly turn-ing upon the crew as the mate hand-ed him the things he had de-mand-ed â my men the thun-der turned old Ahabâ s nee-dles but out of this bit of steel Ahab can make one of his own that will point as true as any â Abashed glances of servile won-der were ex-changed by the sailors as this was said and with fas-ci-nat-ed eyes they await-ed what-ev-er mag-ic might fol-low But Star-buck looked away With a blow from the top maul Ahab knocked off the steel head of the lance and then hand-ing to the mate the long iron rod re-main-ing bade him hold it upright without its touch-ing the deck Then with the maul after re-peat-ed-ly smit-ing the up-per end of this iron rod he placed the blunt-ed nee-dle end-wise on the top of it and less strong-ly ham-mered that sev-er-al times the mate still hold-ing the rod as be-fore Then go-ing through some small strange mo-tions with itâ whether indis-pens-able to the mag-ne-tiz-ing of the steel or mere-ly in-tend-ed to aug-ment the awe of the crew is uncer-tainâ he called for li-nen thread and mov-ing to the bin-na-cle slipped out the two re-v-ersed nee-dles there and hor-i-zon-tal-ly sus-pend-ed the sail nee-dle by its mid-dle over one of the com-pass cards At first the steel went round and round quiv-er-ing and vi-brat-ing at either end but at last it set-tled to its place when Ahab who had been in-tent-ly watch-ing for this re-sult stepped frankly back from the bin-na-cle and point-ing his stretched arm towards it ex-claimed â â Look ye for your-selves if Ahab be not lord of the lev-el load-stone The sun is East and that com-pass swears it â One after another they peered in for noth-ing but their own eyes could per-suade such ig-no-rance as theirs and one after another they slunk away In his fiery eyes of scorn and tri-umph you then saw Ahab in all his fatal pride CHAPTER 125 The Log and Line While now the fat-ed Pe-quod had been so long afloat this voy-age the log and line had but very sel-dom been in use Owing to a con-fi-dent reliance upon other means of deter-min-ing the ves-selâ s place some mer-chant-men and many whale-men espe-cial-ly when cruis-ing whol-ly ne-glect to heave the log though at the same time and fre-quent-ly more for for-mâ s sake than any-thing else reg-u-lar-ly put-ting down upon the cus-tom-ary slate the course steered by the ship as well as the pre-sumed aver-age rate of pro-gres-sion every hour It had been thus with the Pe-quod The wood-en reel and an-gu-lar log at-tached hung long un-touched just be-neath the rail-ing of the after bul-warks Rains and spray had damped it sun and wind had warped it all the ele-men-ts had com-bined to rot a thing that hung so id-ly But heed-less of all this his mood seized Ahab as he hap-pened to glance upon the reel not many hours after the mag-net scene and he re-mem-bered how his quad-rant was no more and re-called his fran-tic oath about the lev-el log and line The ship was sail-ing plung-ing-ly astern the bil-lows rolled in riots â For-ward there Heave the log â Two sea-men came The gold-en hued Tahi-tian and the griz-zly Manx-man â Take the reel one of ye Iâ ll heave â They went towards the ex-treme stern on the shipâ s lee side where the deck with the oblique en-er-gy of the wind was now al-most dip-ping in-to the creamy side-long rush-ing sea The Manx-man took the reel and hold-ing it high up by the pro-ject-ing han-dle ends of the spin-dle round which the spool of line re-volved so stood with the an-gu-lar log hang-ing down-wards till Ahab ad-vanced to him Ahab stood be-fore him and was light-ly un-wind-ing some thir-ty or forty turns to form a pre-lim-i-nary hand coil to toss over-board when the old Manx-man who was in-tent-ly eye-ing both him and the line made bold to speak â Sir I mistrust it this line looks far gone long heat and wet have spoiled it â â â Twill hold old gentle-man Long heat and wet have they spoiled thee Thou seemâ st to hold Or truer per-haps life holds thee not thou it â â I hold the spool sir But just as my cap-tain says With th-ese grey hairs of mine â tis not worth while dis-put-ing â spe-cial-ly with a su-pe-ri-or whoâ ll neâ er con-fess â â Whatâ s that There nowâ s a patched pro-fes-sor in Queen Na-tureâ s gran-ite found-ed Col-lege but me-thinks heâ s too sub-servient Where wert thou born â â In the lit-tle rocky Isle of Man sir â â Ex-cel-lent Thouâ st hit the world by that â â I know not sir but I was born there â â In the Isle of Man hey Well the other way itâ s good Hereâ s a man from Man a man born in once in-de-pen-dent Man and now un-manned of Man which is sucked inâ by what Up with the reel The dead blind wall but-ts all in-quir-ing heads at last Up with it So â The log was heaved The loose coils rapid-ly straight-ened out in a long drag-ging line astern and then in-stant-ly the reel be-gan to whirl In turn jerk-ing-ly raised and low-ered by the rolling bil-lows the tow-ing re-sis-tance of the log caused the old reel-man to stag-ger strange-ly â Hold hard â Snap the over-strained line sagged down in one long festoon the tug-ging log was gone â I crush the quad-rant the thun-der turns the nee-dles and now the mad sea parts the log line But Ahab can mend all Haul in here Tahi-tian reel up Manx-man And look ye let the car-pen-ter make another log and mend thou the line See to it â â There he goes now to him

try-ing to get on board again â â Peace thou crazy loon â cried the Manx-man seiz-ing him by the arm â Away from the quar-ter deck â â The greater idiot ever scolds the less-er â mut-tered Ahab ad-vanc-ing â Hands off from that ho-li-ness Where sayest thou Pip was boy â Astern there sir astern Lo lo â â And who art thou boy I see not my re-flec-tion in the va-cant pupils of thy eyes Oh God

rot-ten lineâ all drip-ping too Mend it eh I think we had best have a new line al-to-geth-er Iâ ll see Mr Stubb about it â CHAPTER 126 The Life Buoy Steer-ing now south east-ward by Ahabâ s lev-elled steel and her progress sole-ly deter-mined by Ahabâ s lev-el log and line the Pe-quod held on her path towards the Equa-tor Mak-ing so long a pas-sage through such un-fre-quent-ed waters de-scry-ing no ships and ere long side-ways im-pelled by un-vary-ing trade winds over waves monotonous-ly mild all th-ese seemed the strange calm things pre-lud-ing some riotous and des-per-ate scene At last when the ship drew near to the out-skirts as it were of the Equa-to-ri-al fish-ing ground and in the deep dark-ness that goes be-fore the dawn was sail-ing by a clus-ter of rocky islets the watchâ then head-ed by Flaskâ was star-tled by a cry so plain-tive-ly wild and un-earth-lyâ like half ar-tic-u-lat-ed wail-ings of the ghosts of all Herodâ s mur-dered In-no-centsâ that one and all they start-ed from their rev-er-ies and for the space of some mo-men-ts stood or sat or leaned all trans-fixed-ly lis-ten-ing like the carved Ro-man slave while that wild cry re-mained within hear-ing The Chris-tian or civ-i-lized part of the crew said it was mer-maids and shud-dered but the pa-gan har-pooneers re-mained unap-palled Yet the grey Manx-manâ the oldest mariner of al-lâ de-clared that the wild thrilling sounds that were heard were the voic-es of new-ly drowned men in the sea Below in his ham-mock Ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn when he came to the deck it was then re-count-ed to him by Flask not unac-com-pa-nied with hint-ed dark mean-ings He hol-low-ly laughed and thus ex-plained the won-der Those rocky is-lands the ship had passed were the re-sort of great num-bers of seals and some young seals that had lost their dams or some dams that had lost their cubs must have risen nigh the ship and kept com-pa-ny with her cry-ing and sob-bing with their hu-man sort of wail But this on-ly the more af-fect-ed some of them be-cause most mariners cher-ish a very su-per-sti-tious feel-ing about seals aris-ing not on-ly from their pe-cu-liar tones when in distress but al-so from the hu-man look of their round heads and se-mi in-tel-li-gent faces seen peer-ing-ly upris-ing from the water along-side In the sea un-der cer-tain cir-cum-stances seals have more than once been mis-tak-en for men But the bod-ings of the crew were destined to re-ceive a most plau-si-ble con-fir-ma-tion in the fate of one of their num-ber that morn-ing At sun rise this man went from his ham-mock to his mast head at the fore and whether it was that he was not yet half waked from his sleep for sailors some-times go aloft in a tran-si-tion state whether it was thus with the man there is now no telling but be that as it may he had not been long at his perch when a cry was heardâ a cry and a rush-ingâ and look-ing up they saw a falling phan-tom in the air and look-ing down a lit-tle tossed heap of white bub-bles in the blue of the sea The life buoyâ a long slen-der caskâ was dropped from the stern where it al-ways hung obe-di-ent to a cun-ning spring but no hand rose to seize it and the sun hav-ing long beat upon this cask it had shrunk-en so that it slow-ly filled and that parched wood al-so filled at its every pore and the stud-ded iron bound cask fol-lowed the sailor to the bot-tom as if to yield him his pil-low though in sooth but a hard one And thus the first man of the Pe-quod that mount-ed the mast to look out for the White Whale on the White Whaleâ s own pe-cu-liar ground that man was swal-lowed up in the deep But few per-haps thought of that at the time In-deed in some sort they were not grieved at this event at least as a por-tent for they re-gard-ed it not as a fore-shad-ow-ing of evil in the fu-ture but as the ful-fil-ment of an evil al-ready pre-saged They de-clared that now they knew the rea-son of those wild shrieks they had heard the night be-fore But again the old Manx-man said nay The lost life buoy was now to be re-placed Star-buck was direct-ed to see to it but as no cask of suf-fi-cient light-ness could be found and as in the fev-er-ish eager-ness of what seemed the ap-proach-ing cri-sis of the voy-age all hands were im-pa-tient of any toil but what was direct-ly con-nect-ed with its fi-nal end what-ev-er that might prove to be there-fore they were go-ing to leave the shipâ s stern un-pro-vid-ed with a buoy when by cer-tain strange signs and inu-en-does Quee-queg hint-ed a hint con-cern-ing his cof-fin â A life buoy of a cof-fin â cried Star-buck start-ing â Rather queer that I should say â said Stubb â It will make a good enough one â said Flask â the car-pen-ter here can ar-range it easi-ly â â Bring it up thereâ s noth-ing else for it â said Star-buck after a me-lan-choly pause â Rig it car-pen-ter do not look at me soâ the cof-fin I mean Dost thou hear me Rig it â â And shall I nail down the lid sir â mov-ing his hand as with a ham-mer â Aye â â And shall I caulk the seams sir â mov-ing his hand as with a caulk-ing iron â Aye â â And shall I then pay over the same with pitch sir â mov-ing his hand as with a pitch pot â Away what possess-es thee to this Make a life buoy of the cof-fin and no more â Mr Stubb Mr Flask come for-ward with me â â He goes off in a huff The whole he can en-dure at the parts he baulks Now I donâ t like this I make a leg for Cap-tain Ahab and he wears it like a gentle-man but I make a band-box for Quee-queg and he wonâ t put his head in-to it Are all my pains to go for noth-ing with that cof-fin And now Iâ m ordered to make a life buoy of it Itâ s like turn-ing an old coat go-ing to bring the flesh on the other side now I donâ t like this cob-bling sort of busi-nessâ I donâ t like it at all itâ s undig-ni-fied itâ s not my place Let tinker-sâ brats do tinker-ings we are their bet-ters I like to take in hand none but clean vir-gin fair and square

mid-dle and at the begin-ning at the end Itâ s the old wo-manâ s tricks to be giv-ing cob-bling jobs Lord what an af-fec-tion all old women have for tinkers I know an old wo-man of six-ty five who ran

their lone-ly old heads to run off with me But heigh ho there are no caps at sea but snow caps Let me see Nail down the lid caulk the seams pay over the same with pitch bat-ten them down tight and hang it with the snap spring over the shipâ s stern Were ever such things done be-fore with a cof-fin Some su-per-sti-tious old car-pen-ters now would be tied up in the rig-ging ere they would do the job But Iâ m made of knot-ty Aroos-t-ook hem-lock I donâ t budge Crup-pered with a cof-fin Sail-ing about with a grave yard tray But nev-er mind We work-ers in woods make bri-dal bed-steads and card

de-scried bear-ing direct-ly down upon the Pe-quod all her spars thick-ly clus-ter-ing with men At the time the Pe-quod was mak-ing good speed through the water but as the broad winged wind-ward stranger shot nigh to her the boast-ful sails all fell to-geth-er as blank blad-ders that are burst and all life fled from the smit-ten hull â Bad news she brings bad news â mut-tered the old Manx-man But ere her com-man-der who with trum-pet to mouth stood up in his boat ere he could hope-ful-ly hail Ahabâ s voice was heard â Hast seen the White Whale â â Aye yes-ter-day Have ye seen a whale boat adrift â Throt-tling his joy Ahab nega-tive-ly an-swered this un-ex-pect-ed ques-tion and would then have fain board-ed the stranger when the stranger cap-tain him-self hav-ing stopped his ves-selâ s way was seen descend-ing her side A few keen pul-ls and his boat hook soon clinched the Pe-quodâ s main chains and he sprang to the deck Im-me-di-ate-ly he was recog-nised by Ahab for a Nan-tuck-eter he knew But no for-mal sa-lu-ta-tion was ex-changed â Where was he â not killed â not killed â cried Ahab close-ly ad-vanc-ing â How was it â It seemed that some-what late on the after-noon of the day pre-vi-ous while three of the strangerâ s boats were en-gaged with a shoal of whales which had led them some four or five miles from the ship and while they were yet in swift chase to wind-ward the white hump and head of Mo-by Dick had sud-den-ly loomed up out of the water not very far to lee-ward where-upon the fourth rigged boatâ a re-served oneâ had been in-stant-ly low-ered in chase After a keen sail be-fore the wind this fourth boatâ the swiftest keeled of al-lâ seemed to have suc-ceed-ed in fas-ten-ingâ at least as well as the man at the mast head could tell any-thing about it In the dis-tance he saw the di-min-ished dot-ted boat and then a swift gleam of bub-bling white water and after that noth-ing more whence it was con-clud-ed that the strick-en whale must have in-def-i-nite-ly run away with his pur-suers as often hap-pens There was some ap-pre-hen-sion but no pos-i-tive alarm as yet The re-call sig-nals were placed in the rig-ging dark-ness came on and forced to pick up her three far to wind-ward boat-sâ ere go-ing in quest of the fourth one in the pre-cise-ly op-po-site direc-tionâ the ship had not on-ly been ne-ces-si-tat-ed to leave that boat to its fate till near mid-night but for the time to in-crease her dis-tance from it But the rest of her crew be-ing at last safe aboard she crowd-ed all sailâ stun-sail on stun-sailâ after the miss-ing boat kin-dling a fire in her try pots for a bea-con and every other man aloft on the look out But though when she had thus sailed a suf-fi-cient dis-tance to gain the pre-sumed place of the ab-sent ones when last seen though she then paused to low-er her spare boats to pull all around her and not find-ing any-thing had again dashed on again paused and low-ered her boats and though she had thus con-tin-ued do-ing till day-light yet not the least glimpse of the miss-ing keel had been seen The sto-ry told the stranger Cap-tain im-me-di-ate-ly went on to re-veal his ob-ject in board-ing the Pe-quod He de-sired that ship to unite with his own in the search by sail-ing over the sea some four or five miles apart on par-al-lel lines and so sweep-ing a dou-ble hori-zon as it were â I will wager some-thing now â whis-pered Stubb to Flask â that some one in that miss-ing boat wore off that Cap-tainâ s best coat may-hap his watchâ heâ s so cursed anx-ious to get it back Who ever heard of two pious whale ships cruis-ing after one miss-ing whale boat in the height of the whal-ing sea-son See Flask on-ly see how pale he look-sâ pale in the very but-tons of his eyesâ lookâ it was-nâ t the coatâ it must have been theâ â â My boy my own boy is among them For Godâ s sakeâ I beg I con-jureâ â here ex-claimed the stranger Cap-tain to Ahab who thus far had but ici-ly re-ceived his pe-ti-tion â For eight and forty hours let me char-ter your shipâ I will glad-ly pay for it and round-ly pay for itâ if there be no other wayâ for eight and forty hours on-lyâ on-ly thatâ you must oh you must and you shall do this thing â â His son â cried Stubb â oh itâ s his son heâ s lost I take back the coat and watchâ what says Ahab We must save that boy â â Heâ s drowned with the rest on â em last night â said the old Manx sailor stand-ing be-hind them â I heard all of ye heard their spir-its â Now as it short-ly turned out what made this in-ci-dent of the Rachelâ s the more me-lan-choly was the cir-cum-stance that not on-ly was one of the Cap-tainâ s sons among the num-ber of the miss-ing boatâ s crew but among the num-ber of the other boatâ s crews at the same time but on the other hand separat-ed from the ship dur-ing the dark vi-cis-si-tudes of the chase there had been still another son as that for a time the wretched father was plunged to the bot-tom of the cru-ellest per-plex-i-ty which was on-ly solved for him by his chief mateâ s in-stinc-tive-ly adopt-ing the or-di-nary pro-ce-dure of a whale ship in such emer-gen-cies that is when placed between jeop-ar-dized but di-vid-ed boats al-ways to pick up the ma-jor-i-ty first But the cap-tain for some un-known con-sti-tu-tion-al rea-son had re-frained from men-tion-ing all this and not till forced to it by Ahabâ s ici-ness did he al-lude to his one yet miss-ing boy a lit-tle lad but twelve years old whose father with the earnest but un-mis-giv-ing hardi-hood of a Nan-tuck-eterâ s pa-ter-nal love had thus ear-ly sought to ini-ti-ate him in the per-ils and won-ders of a vo-ca-tion al-most im-memo-ri-al-ly the destiny of all his race Nor does it un-fre-quent-ly oc-cur that Nan-tuck-et cap-tains will send a son of such ten-der age away from them for a pro-tract-ed three or four yearsâ voy-age in some other ship than their own so that their first knowl-edge of a whale-manâ s ca-reer shall be unen-er-vat-ed by any chance dis-play of a fatherâ s nat-u-ral but un-time-ly par-tial-i-ty or un-due ap-pre-hen-sive-ness and con-cern Mean-time now the stranger was still be-seech-ing his poor boon of Ahab and Ahab still stood like an anvil re-ceiv-ing every shock but without the least quiv-er-ing of his own â I will not go â said the stranger â till you say aye to me Do to me as you would have me do to you in the like case For you too have a boy Cap-tain Ahabâ though but a child and nestling safe-ly at home nowâ a child of your old age tooâ Yes yes you re-lent I see itâ run run men now and stand by to square in the yards â â Avast â cried Ahabâ â touch not a rope yarnâ then in a voice that pro-long-ing-ly mould-ed every wordâ â Cap-tain Gar-diner I will not do it Even now I lose time Good bye good bye God bless ye man and may I for-give my-self but I must go Mr Star-buck look at the bin-na-cle watch and in three min-utes from this pre-sent in-stant warn off all strangers then brace for-ward again and let the ship sail as be-fore â Hur-ried-ly turn-ing with avert-ed face he descend-ed in-to his cabin leav-ing the strange cap-tain trans-fixed at this un-con-di-tion-al and ut-ter re-jec-tion of his so earnest suit But start-ing from his en-chant-ment Gar-diner si-lent-ly hur-ried to the side more fell than stepped in-to his boat and re-turned to his ship Soon the two ships diverged their wakes and long as the strange ves-sel was in view she was seen to yaw hither and thith-er at every dark spot how-ev-er small on the sea This way and that her yards were swung round star-board and lar-board she con-tin-ued to tack now she beat against a head sea and again it pushed her be-fore it while all the while her masts and yards were thick-ly clus-tered with men as three tall cher-ry trees when the boys are cher-ry-ing among the boughs But by her still halt-ing course and wind-ing woe-ful way you plain-ly saw that this ship that so wept with spray still re-mained without com-fort She was Rachel weep-ing for her chil-dren be-cause they were not CHAPTER 129 The Cabin Ahab mov-ing to go on deck Pip catch-es him by the hand to fol-low â Lad lad I tell thee thou must not fol-low Ahab now The hour is com-ing when Ahab would not scare thee from him yet would not have thee by him There is that in thee poor lad which I feel too cur-ing to my mal-a-dy Like cures like and for this hunt my mal-a-dy be-comes my most de-sired health Do thou abide below here where they shall serve thee as if thou wert the cap-tain Aye lad thou shalt sit here in my own screwed chair another screw to it thou must be â â No no no ye have not a whole body sir do ye but use poor me for your one lost leg on-ly tread upon me sir I ask no more so I re-main a part of ye â â Oh spite of mil-lion vil-lains this makes me a big-ot in the fade-less fideli-ty of man â and a black and crazy â but me-thinks like cures like ap-plies to him too he grows so sane again â â They tell me sir that Stubb did once desert poor lit-tle Pip whose drowned bones now show white for all the black-ness of his liv-ing skin But I will nev-er desert ye sir as Stubb did him Sir I must go with ye â â If thou speak-est thus to me much more Ahabâ s pur-pose keels up in him I tell thee no it can-not be â â Oh good master master master â Weep so and I will mur-der thee have a care for Ahab too is mad Lis-ten and thou wilt often hear my ivory foot upon the deck and still know that I am there And now I quit thee Thy hand â Met True art thou lad as the cir-cum-fer-ence to its cen-tre So God for ever bless thee and if it come to that â God for ever save thee let what will be-fall â Ahab goes Pip steps one step for-ward â Here he this in-stant stood I stand in his air â but Iâ m alone Now were even poor Pip here I could en-dure it but heâ s miss-ing Pip Pip Ding dong ding Whoâ s seen Pip He must be up here letâ s try the door What nei-ther lock nor bolt nor bar and yet thereâ s no open-ing it It must be the spell he told me to stay here Aye and told me this screwed chair was mine Here then Iâ ll seat me against the tran-som in the shipâ s full mid-dle all her keel and her three masts be-fore me Here our old sailors say in their black seven-ty fours great ad-mi-rals some-times sit at table and lord it over rows of cap-tains and lieu-tenan-ts Ha whatâ s this epaulets epaulets the epaulets all come crowd-ing Pass round the de-can-ters glad to see ye fill up mon-sieurs What an odd feel-ing now when a black boyâ s host to white men with gold lace upon their coats â Mon-sieurs have ye seen one Pip â a lit-tle ne-gro lad five feet high hang dog look and coward-ly Jumped from a whale boat once â seen him No Well then fill up again cap-tains and letâ s drink shame upon all cowards I name no names Shame upon them Put one foot upon the table Shame upon all cowards â Hist above there I hear ivoryâ Oh master master I am in-deed down heart-ed when you walk over me But here Iâ ll stay though this stern strikes rocks and they bulge through and oys-ters come to join me â CHAPTER 13 The Hat And now that at the prop-er time and place after so long and wide a pre-lim-i-nary cruise Ahab â all other whal-ing waters swep-tâ seemed to have chased his foe in-to an ocean fold to slay him the more se-cure-ly there now that he found him-self hard by the very lat-i-tude and lon-gi-tude where his tor-ment-ing wound had been in-flict-ed now that a ves-sel had been spo-ken which on the very day pre-ced-ing had ac-tu-al-ly en-coun-tered Mo-by Dick â and now that all his suc-ces-sive meet-ings with var-i-ous ships con-trast-ing-ly con-curred to show the de-mo-ni-ac in-dif-fer-ence with which the white whale tore his hun-ters whether sin-ning or sinned against now it was that there lurked a some-thing in the old manâ s eyes which it was hard-ly suf-fer-able for fee-ble souls to see As the unset-ting po-lar star which through the live-long arc-tic six month-sâ night sus-tains its pierc-ing steady cen-tral gaze so Ahabâ s pur-pose now fixed-ly gleamed down upon the con-stant mid-night of the gloomy crew It dom-i-neered above them so that all their bod-ings doubts mis-giv-ings fears were fain to hide be-neath their souls and not sprout forth a sin-gle spear or leaf In this fore-shad-ow-ing in-ter-val too all hu-mor forced or nat-u-ral van-ished Stubb no more strove to raise a smile Star-buck no more strove to check one Alike joy and sor-row hope and fear seemed ground to finest dust and pow-dered for the time in the clamped mor-tar of Ahabâ s iron soul Like machines they dumbly moved about the deck ever con-scious that the old manâ s despot eye was on them But did you deeply scan him in his more se-cret con-fi-den-tial hours when he thought no glance but one was on him then you would have seen that even as Ahabâ s eyes so awed the crewâ s the in-scrutable Parseeâ s glance awed his or some-how at least in some wild way at times af-fect-ed it Such an added glid-ing strangeness be-gan to in-vest the thin Fedal-lah now such cease-less shud-der-ings shook him that the men looked du-bi-ous at him half uncer-tain as it seemed whether in-deed he were a mor-tal sub-stance or else a tremu-lous shad-ow cast upon the deck by some unseen be-ingâ s body And that shad-ow was al-ways hover-ing there For not by night even had Fedal-lah ever cer-tain-ly been known to slum-ber or go below He would stand still for hours but nev-er sat or leaned his wan but won-drous eyes did plain-ly sayâ We two watch-men nev-er rest Nor at any time by night or day could the mariners now step upon the deck un-less Ahab was be-fore them either stand-ing in his piv-ot hole or ex-act-ly pac-ing the planks between two un-de-vi-at-ing lim-its â the main mast and the mizen or else they saw him stand-ing in the cabin scut-tle â his liv-ing foot ad-vanced upon the deck as if to step his hat slouched heav-i-ly over his eyes so that how-ev-er mo-tion-less he stood how-ev-er the days and nights were added on that he had not swung in his ham-mock yet hid-den be-neath that slouch-ing hat they could nev-er tell un-erring-ly whether for all this his eyes were real-ly closed at times or whether he was still in-tent-ly scan-ning them no mat-ter though he stood so in the scut-tle for a whole hour on the stretch and the un-heed-ed night damp gathered in beads of dew upon that stone carved coat and hat The clothes that the night had wet the next dayâ s sun-shine dried upon him and so day after day and night after night he went no more be-neath the planks what-ev-er he want-ed from the cabin that thing he sent for He ate in the same open air that is his two on-ly meals â break-fast and din-ner sup-per he nev-er touched nor reaped his beard which dark-ly grew all gnarled as un-earthed roots of trees blown over which still grow id-ly on at naked base though per-ished in the up-per ver-dure But though his whole life was now be-come one watch on deck and though the Parseeâ s mys-tic watch was without in-ter-mis-sion as his own yet th-ese two nev-er seemed to speakâ one man to the otherâ un-less at long in-ter-vals some pass-ing un-mo-men-tous mat-ter made it ne-c-es-sary Though such a po-tent spell seemed se-cret-ly to join the twain open-ly and to the awe struck crew they seemed pole like asun-der If by day they chanced to speak one word by night dumb men were both so far as con-cerned the slight-est ver-bal in-ter-change At times for longest hours without a sin-gle hail they stood far part-ed in the starlight Ahab in his scut-tle the Parsee by the main-mast but still fixed-ly gaz-ing upon each other as if in the Parsee Ahab saw his forethrown shad-ow in Ahab the Parsee his aban-doned sub-stance And yet some-how did Ahabâ in his own prop-er self as dai-ly hourly and every in-stant com-mand-ing-ly re-vealed to his subor-di-nates â Ahab seemed an in-de-pen-dent lord the Parsee but his slave Still again both seemed yoked to-geth-er and an unseen tyrant driv-ing them the lean shade sid-ing the sol-id rib For be this Parsee what he may all rib and keel was sol-id Ahab At the first fain-test glim-mer-ing of the dawn his iron voice was heard from aft â â Man the mast heads â â and all through the day till after sun-set and after twi-light the same voice every hour at the strik-ing of the helms-manâ s bell was heardâ â What dâ ye see â sharp sharp â But when three or four days had slid-ed by after meet-ing the chil-dren seek-ing Rachel and no spout had yet been seen the mono-ma-ni-ac old man seemed distrust-ful of his crewâ s fideli-ty at least of near-ly all ex-cept the Pa-gan har-pooneers he seemed to doubt even whether Stubb and Flask might not willing-ly over-look the sight he sought But if th-ese sus-pi-cions were real-ly his he sa-ga-cious-ly re-frained from ver-bal-ly ex-press-ing them how-ev-er his ac-tions might seem to hint them â I will have the first sight of the whale my-self â â he said â Aye Ahab must have the dou-bloon â and with his own hands he rigged a nest of bas-ket-ed bow-lines and send-ing a hand aloft with a sin-gle sheaved block to se-cure to the main mast head he re-ceived the two ends of the down-ward reeved rope and at-tach-ing one to his bas-ket pre-pared a pin for the other end in order to fas-ten it at the rail This done with that end yet in his hand and stand-ing be-side the pin he looked round upon his crew sweep-ing from one to the other paus-ing his glance long upon Dag-goo Quee-queg Tashtego but shun-ning Fedal-lah and then set-tling his firm re-ly-ing eye upon the chief mate said â â Take the rope sirâ I give it in-to thy hands Star-buck â Then ar-rang-ing his per-son in the bas-ket he gave the word for them to hoist him to his perch Star-buck be-ing the one who se-cured the rope at last and after-wards stood near it And thus with one hand cling-ing round the roy-al mast Ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for miles and miles â ahead astern this side and that â within the wide ex-pand-ed cir-cle com-mand-ed at so great a height When in work-ing with his hands at some lofty al-most iso-lat-ed place in the rig-ging which chances to af-ford no foothold the sailor at sea is hoist-ed up to that spot and sus-tained there by the rope un-der th-ese cir-cum-stances its fas-tened end on deck is al-ways giv-en in strict charge to some one man who has the spe-cial watch of it Be-cause in such a wilder-ness of run-ning rig-ging whose var-i-ous dif-fer-ent re-la-tions aloft can-not al-ways be in-fal-li-bly dis-cerned by what is seen of them at the deck and when the deck ends of th-ese ropes are be-ing every few min-utes cast down from the fas-ten-ings it would be but a nat-u-ral fatal-i-ty if un-pro-vid-ed with a con-stant watch-man the hoist-ed sailor should by some care-less-ness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all swoop-ing to the sea So Ahabâ s pro-ceed-ings in this mat-ter were not unusu-al the on-ly strange thing about them seemed to be that Star-buck al-most the one on-ly man who had ever ven-tured to op-pose him with any-thing in the slight-est de-gree ap-proach-ing to de-ci-sionâ one of those too whose faith-ful-ness on the look out he had seemed to doubt some-what â it was strange that this was the very man he should select for his watch-man freely giv-ing his whole life in-to such an other-wise distrust-ed per-sonâ s hands Now the first time Ahab was perched aloft ere he had been there ten min-utes one of those red billed sav-age sea hawks which so often fly in-com-modi-ous-ly close round the manned mast heads of whale-men in th-ese lat-i-tudes one of th-ese birds came wheel-ing and scream-ing round his head in a maze of un-track-ably swift cir-clings Then it dart-ed a thou-sand feet straight up in-to the air then spi-ral-ized down-wards and went ed-dy-ing again round his head But with his gaze fixed upon the dim and dis-tant hori-zon Ahab seemed not to mark this wild bird nor in-deed would any one else have marked it much it be-ing no un-com-mon cir-cum-stance on-ly now al-most the least heed-ful eye seemed to see some sort of cun-ning mean-ing in al-most every sight â Your hat your hat sir â sud-den-ly cried the Si-cil-ian sea-man who be-ing post-ed at the mizen mast head stood direct-ly be-hind Ahab though some-what low-er than his lev-el and with a deep gulf of air di-vid-ing them But al-ready the sable wing was be-fore the old manâ s eyes the long hooked bill at his head with a scream the black hawk dart-ed away with his prize An ea-gle flew thrice round Tar-quinâ s head re-mov-ing his cap to re-place it and there-upon Tanaquil his wife de-clared that Tar-quin would be king of Rome But on-ly by the re-plac-ing of the cap was that omen ac-count-ed good Ahabâ s hat was nev-er re-stored the wild hawk flew on and on with it far in ad-vance of the prow and at last dis-ap-peared while from the point of that dis-ap-pear-ance a minute black spot was dim-ly dis-cerned falling from that vast height in-to the sea CHAPTER 131 The Pe-quod Meets The De-light The in-tense Pe-quod sailed on the rolling waves and days went by the life buoy cof-fin still light-ly swung and another ship most mis-er-ably mis-named the De-light was de-scried As she drew nigh all eyes were fixed upon her broad beams called shears which in some whal-ing ships cross the quar-ter deck at the height of eight or nine feet serv-ing to car-ry the spare un-rigged or dis-abled boats Upon the strangerâ s shears were be-held the shat-tered white ribs and some few splin-tered planks of what had once been a whale boat but you now saw through this wreck as plain-ly as you see through the peeled half un-hinged and bleach-ing skele-ton of a horse â Hast seen the White Whale â â Look â replied the hol-low cheeked cap-tain from his taf-frail and with his trum-pet he point-ed to the wreck â Hast killed him â â The har-poon is not yet forged that ever will do that â an-swered the other sad-ly glanc-ing upon a round-ed ham-mock on the deck whose gathered sides some noise-less sailors were busy in sew-ing to-geth-er â Not forged â and snatch-ing Perthâ s lev-elled iron from the crotch Ahab held it out ex-claim-ingâ â Look ye Nan-tuck-eter here in this hand I hold his death Tem-pered in blood and tem-pered by light-ning are th-ese bar-bs and I swear to tem-per them triply in that hot place be-hind the fin where the White Whale most feels his ac-cursed life â â Then God keep thee old manâ seeâ st thou thatâ â point-ing to the ham-mockâ â I bury but one of five stout men who were alive on-ly yes-ter-day but were dead ere night On-ly that one I bury the rest were buried be-fore they died you sail upon their tomb â Then turn-ing to his crewâ â Are ye ready there place the plank then on the rail and lift the body so thenâ Oh Godâ â ad-vanc-ing towards the ham-mock with uplift-ed hand-sâ â may the res-ur-rec-tion and the lifeâ â â â Brace for-ward Up helm â cried Ahab like light-ning to his men But the sud-den-ly start-ed Pe-quod was not quick enough to es-cape the sound of the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea not so quick in-deed but that some of the fly-ing bub-bles might have sprin-kled her hull with their ghost-ly bap-tism As Ahab now glid-ed from the de-ject-ed De-light the strange life buoy hang-ing at the Pe-quodâ s stern came in-to con-spic-u-ous relief â Ha yon-der look yon-der men â cried a fore-bod-ing voice in her wake â In vain oh ye strangers ye fly our sad buri-al ye but turn us your taf-frail to show us your cof-fin â CHAPTER 132 The Sym-pho-ny It was a clear steel blue day The fir-ma-men-ts of air and sea were hard-ly separa-ble in that all per-vad-ing azure on-ly the pen-sive air was trans-par-ent-ly pure and soft with a wo-manâ s look and the ro-bust and man like sea heaved with long strong lin-ger-ing swells as Sam-sonâ s ch-est in his sleep Hither and thith-er on high glid-ed the snow white wings of small un-speck-led birds th-ese were the gen-tle thoughts of the fem-i-nine air but to and fro in the deeps far down in the bot-tom-less blue rushed mighty le-viathans sword fish and sharks and th-ese were the strong trou-bled mur-der-ous think-ings of the mas-cu-line sea But though thus con-trast-ing within the con-trast was on-ly in shades and shad-ows without those two seemed one it was on-ly the sex as it were that distin-guished them Aloft like a roy-al czar and king the sun seemed giv-ing this gen-tle air to this bold and rolling sea even as bride to groom And at the girdling line of the hori-zon a soft and tremu-lous mo-tionâ most seen here at the equa-torâ denot-ed the fond throb-bing trust the lov-ing alar-ms with which the poor bride gave her bo-som away Tied up and twist-ed gnarled and knot-ted with wrin-kles hag-gard-ly firm and unyield-ing his eyes glow-ing like coals that still glow in the ash-es of ruin un-tot-ter-ing Ahab stood forth in the clear-ness of the morn lift-ing his splin-tered hel-met of a brow to the fair gir-lâ s fore-head of heav-en Oh im-mor-tal in-fan-cy and in-no-cen-cy of the azure In-vis-i-ble winged crea-tures that frolic all round us Sweet child-hood of air and sky how obliv-i-ous were ye of old Ahabâ s close coiled woe But so have I seen lit-tle Miri-am and Martha laugh-ing eyed elves heed-less-ly gam-bol around their old sire sport-ing with the cir-cle of singed locks which grew on the marge of that burnt out crater of his brain Slow-ly cross-ing the deck from the scut-tle Ahab leaned over the side and watched how his shad-ow in the water sank and sank to his gaze the more and the more that he strove to pierce the pro-fun-di-ty But the love-ly aro-mas in that en-chant-ed air did at last seem to dis-pel for a mo-ment the can-ker-ous thing in his soul That glad hap-py air that win-some sky did at last stroke and ca-ress him the step mother world so long cru-elâ for-bid-dingâ now threw af-fec-tion-ate ar-ms round his stub-born neck and did seem to joy-ous-ly sob over him as if over one that how-ev-er wil-ful and er-ring she could yet find it in her heart to save and to bless From be-neath his slouched hat Ahab dropped a tear in-to the sea nor did all the Pa-cif-ic con-tain such wealth as that one wee drop Star-buck saw the old man saw him how he heav-i-ly leaned over the side and he seemed to hear in his own true heart the mea-sure-less sob-bing that stole out of the cen-tre of the seren-i-ty around Care-ful not to touch him or be no-ticed by him he yet drew near to him and stood there Ahab turned â Star-buck â â Sir â â Oh Star-buck it is a mild mild wind and a mild look-ing sky On such a dayâ very much such a sweet-ness as thisâ I struck my first whaleâ a boy har-pooneer of eigh-teen Fortyâ fortyâ forty years ago â ago Forty years of con-tin-u-al whal-ing forty years of pri-va-tion and per-il and storm time forty years on the pi-ti-less sea for forty years

foam-ing-ly chased his preyâ more a de-mon than a man â aye aye what a forty yearsâ foolâ foolâ old fool has old Ahab been Why this strife of the chase why weary and pal-sy the arm at the oar and the iron and the lance how the rich-er or bet-ter is Ahab now Be-hold Oh Star-buck is it not hard that with this weary load I bear one poor leg should have been snatched from un-der me Here brush this old hair aside it blinds me that I seem to weep Locks so grey did nev-er grow but from out some ash-es But do I look very old so very very old Star-buck I feel dead-ly faint bowed and humped as though I were Adam stag-ger-ing be-neath the piled cen-turies since Par-adise God God God â crack my heart â stave my brain â mock-ery mock-ery bit-ter bit-ing mock-ery of grey hairs have I lived enough joy to wear ye and seem and feel thus in-tol-er-a-bly old Close stand close to me Star-buck let me look in-to a hu-man eye it is bet-ter than to gaze in-to sea or sky bet-ter than to gaze upon God By the green land by the bright hearth stone this is the mag-ic glass man I see my wife and my child in thine eye No no stay on board on board â low-er not when I do when brand-ed Ahab gives chase to Mo-by Dick That hazard shall not be thine No no not with the far away home I see in that eye â â Oh my Cap-tain my Cap-tain noble soul grand old heart after all why should any one give chase to that hat-ed fish Away with me let us fly th-ese dead-ly waters let us home Wife and child too are Star-buckâ sâ wife and child of his brother-ly sis-ter-ly play fel-low youth even as thine sir are the wife and child of thy lov-ing long-ing pa-ter-nal old age Away let us away â this in-stant let me al-ter the course How cheer-i-ly how hi-lar-i-ous-ly O my Cap-tain would we bowl on our way to see old Nan-tuck-et again I think sir they have some such mild blue days even as this in Nan-tuck-et â â They have they have I have seen themâ some sum-mer days in the morn-ing About this timeâ yes it is his noon nap nowâ the boy vi-va-cious-ly wakes sits up in bed and his mother tel-ls him of me of can-ni-bal old me how I am abroad upon the deep but will yet come back to dance him again â â â Tis my Mary my Mary her-self She promised that my boy every morn-ing should be car-ried to the hill to catch the first glimpse of his fatherâ s sail Yes yes no more it is done we head for Nan-tuck-et Come my Cap-tain study out the course and let us away See see the boyâ s face from the win-dow the boyâ s hand on the hill â But Ahabâ s glance was avert-ed like a blight-ed fruit tree he shook and cast his last cin-dered ap-ple to the soil â What is it what name-less in-scrutable un-earth-ly thing is it what cozen-ing hid-den lord and master and cru-el re-morse-less em-per-or com-mands me that against all nat-u-ral lov-ings and long-ings I so keep push-ing and crowd-ing and jam-ming my-self on all the time reck-less-ly mak-ing me ready to do what in my own prop-er nat-u-ral heart I durst not so much as dare Is Ahab Ahab Is it I God or who that lifts this arm But if the great sun move not of him-self but is as an er-rand boy in heav-en nor one sin-gle star can re-volve but by some in-vis-i-ble pow-er how then can this one small heart beat this one small brain think thoughts un-less God does that beat-ing does that think-ing does that liv-ing and not I By heav-en man we are turned round and round in this world like yon-der wind-lass and Fate is the hand-spike And all the time lo that smil-ing sky and this un-sound-ed sea Look see yon Al-bi-core who put it in-to him to chase and fang that fly-ing fish Where do mur-der-ers go man Whoâ s to doom when the judge him-self is dragged to the bar But it is a mild mild wind and a mild look-ing sky and the air smel-ls now as if it blew from a far away mead-ow they have been mak-ing hay some-where un-der the slopes of the An-des Star-buck and the mow-ers are sleep-ing among the new mown hay Sleep-ing Aye toil we how we may we all sleep at last on the field Sleep Aye and rust amid green-ness as last yearâ s scythes flung down and left in the half cut swath-sâ Star-buck â But blanched to a corpseâ s hue with de-s-pair the Mate had stolen away Ahab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side but start-ed at two re-flect-ed fixed eyes in the water there Fedal-lah was mo-tion-less-ly lean-ing over the same rail CHAPTER 133 The Chaseâ First Day That night in the mid watch when the old manâ as his wont at in-ter-val-sâ stepped forth from the scut-tle in which he leaned and went to his piv-ot hole he sud-den-ly thrust out his face fierce-ly snuff-ing up the sea air as a sa-ga-cious shipâ s dog will in draw-ing nigh to some bar-barous isle He de-clared that a whale must be near Soon that pe-cu-liar odor some-times to a great dis-tance giv-en forth by the liv-ing sperm whale was pal-pa-ble to all the watch nor was any mariner sur-prised when after in-spect-ing the com-pass and then the dog vane and then ascer-tain-ing the pre-cise bear-ing of the odor as near-ly as pos-si-ble Ahab rapid-ly ordered the shipâ s course to be slight-ly al-tered and the sail to be short-ened The acute pol-i-cy dic-tat-ing th-ese move-men-ts was suf-fi-cient-ly vindi-cat-ed at day-break by the sight of a long sleek on the sea direct-ly and length-wise ahead smooth as oil and re-sem-bling in the pleat-ed watery wrin-kles border-ing it the pol-ished me-tal-lic like marks of some swift tide rip at the mouth of a deep rapid stream â Man the mast heads Call all hands â Thun-der-ing with the but-ts of three clubbed hand-spikes on the fore-cas-tle deck Dag-goo roused the sleep-ers with such judg-ment claps that they seemed to ex-hale from the scut-tle so in-stan-ta-neous-ly did they ap-pear with their clothes in their hands â What dâ ye see â cried Ahab flat-ten-ing his face to the sky â Noth-ing noth-ing sir â was the sound hail-ing down in re-ply â Tâ gal-lant sails â stun-sails alow and aloft and on both sides â All sail be-ing set he now cast loose the life line re-served for sway-ing him to the main roy-al mast head and in a few mo-men-ts they were hoist-ing him thith-er when while but two thirds of the way aloft and while peer-ing ahead through the hor-i-zon-tal va-can-cy between the main top sail and top gal-lant sail he raised a gull like cry in the air â There she blows â there she blows A hump like a snow hill It is Mo-by Dick â Fired by the cry which seemed si-mul-ta-ne-ous-ly tak-en up by the three look outs the men on deck rushed to the rig-ging to be-hold the fa-mous whale they had so long been pur-su-ing Ahab had now gained his fi-nal perch some feet above the other look outs Tashtego stand-ing just be-neath him on the cap of the top gal-lant mast so that the In-di-anâ s head was al-most on a lev-el with Ahabâ s heel From this height the whale was now seen some mile or so ahead at every roll of the sea re-veal-ing his high sparkling hump and reg-u-lar-ly jet-ting his si-lent spout in-to the air To the cred-u-lous mariners it seemed the same si-lent spout they had so long ago be-held in the moon-lit At-lantic and In-di-an Oceans â And did none of ye see it be-fore â cried Ahab hail-ing the perched men all around him â I saw him al-most that same in-stant sir that Cap-tain Ahab did and I cried out â said Tashtego â Not the same in-stant not the sameâ no the dou-bloon is mine Fate re-served the dou-bloon for me I on-ly none of ye could have raised the White Whale first There she blows â there she blows â there she blows There again â there again â he cried in long drawn lin-ger-ing me-thod-ic tones at-tuned to the grad-u-al pro-long-ings of the whaleâ s vis-i-ble jets â Heâ s go-ing to sound In stun-sails Down top gal-lant sails Stand by three boats Mr Star-buck re-mem-ber stay on board and keep the ship Helm there Luff luff a point So steady man steady There go flukes No no on-ly black water All ready the boats there Stand by stand by Low-er me Mr Star-buck low-er low-er â quick quick-er â and he slid through the air to the deck â He is head-ing straight to lee-ward sir â cried Stubb â right away from us can-not have seen the ship yet â â Be dumb man Stand by the braces Hard down the helm â brace up Shiv-er her â shiv-er her â So well that Boats boats â Soon all the boats but Star-buckâ s were dropped all the boat sails setâ all the pad-dles ply-ing with rip-pling swift-ness shoot-ing to lee-ward and Ahab head-ing the onset A pale death glim-mer lit up Fedal-lahâ s sunken eyes a hideous mo-tion gnawed his mouth Like noise-less nau-tilus shel-ls their light prows sped through the sea but on-ly slow-ly they neared the foe As they neared him the ocean grew still more smooth seemed draw-ing a car-pet over its waves seemed a noon mead-ow so serene-ly it spread At length the breath-less hunter came so nigh his seem-ing-ly un-sus-pect-ing prey that his en-tire daz-zling hump was distinct-ly vis-i-ble slid-ing along the sea as if an iso-lat-ed thing and con-tin-u-al-ly set in a re-volv-ing ring of finest fleecy green-ish foam He saw the vast in-volved wrin-kles of the slight-ly pro-ject-ing head beyond Be-fore it far out on the soft Turk-ish rugged waters went the glis-ten-ing white shad-ow from his broad milky fore-head a mu-si-cal rip-pling play-ful-ly ac-com-pa-ny-ing the shade and be-hind the blue waters in-ter-change-ably flowed over in-to the mov-ing val-ley of his steady wake and on either hand bright bub-bles arose and danced by his side But th-ese were bro-ken again by the light toes of hun-dreds of gay fowl soft-ly feather-ing the sea al-ter-nate with their fit-ful flight and like to some flag staff ris-ing from the paint-ed hull of an ar-gosy the tall but shat-tered pole of a re-cent lance pro-ject-ed from the white whaleâ s back and at in-ter-vals one of the cloud of soft toed fowls hover-ing and to and fro skim-ming like a canopy over the fish si-lent-ly perched and rocked on this pole the long tail feathers stream-ing like pen-nons A gen-tle joy-ous-nessâ a mighty mild-ness of re-pose in swift-ness in-vest-ed the glid-ing whale Not the white bull Jupiter swim-ming away with rav-ished Europa cling-ing to his grace-ful horns his love-ly leer-ing eyes side-ways in-tent upon the maid with smooth be-witch-ing fleet-ness rip-pling straight for the nup-tial bow-er in Crete not Jove not that great majesty Supreme did sur-pass the glori-fied White Whale as he so divine-ly swam On each soft sideâ coin-ci-dent with the part-ed swell that but once leav-ing him then flowed so wide awayâ on each bright side the whale shed off en-tic-ings No won-der there had been some among the hun-ters who name-less-ly trans-port-ed and al-lured by all this seren-i-ty had ven-tured to as-sail it but had fatal-ly found that qui-etude but the ves-ture of tor-na-does Yet calm en-tic-ing calm oh whale thou glidest on to all who for the first time eye thee no mat-ter how many in that same way thou mayâ st have be-jug-gled and de-stroyed be-fore And thus through the serene tran-quil-li-ties of the trop-i-cal sea among waves whose hand clap-pings were sus-pend-ed by ex-ceed-ing rap-ture Mo-by Dick moved on still with-hold-ing from sight the full ter-rors of his sub-merged trunk en-tire-ly hid-ing the wrenched hideous-ness of his jaw But soon the fore part of him slow-ly rose from the water for an in-stant his whole mar-bleized body formed a high arch like Vir-gini-aâ s Nat-u-ral Bridge and warn-ing-ly wav-ing his ban-nered flukes in the air the grand god re-vealed him-self sound-ed and went out of sight Hover-ing-ly halt-ing and dip-ping on the wing the white sea fowls long-ing-ly lin-gered over the agi-tat-ed pool that he left With oars apeak and pad-dles down the sheets of their sails adrift the three boats now stil-ly float-ed await-ing Mo-by Dickâ s reap-pear-ance â An hour â said Ahab stand-ing root-ed in his boatâ s stern and he gazed beyond the whaleâ s place towards the dim blue spaces and wide woo-ing va-can-cies to lee-ward It was on-ly an in-stant for again his eyes seemed whirling round in his head as he swept the watery cir-cle The breeze now fresh-ened the sea be-gan to swell â The birds â the birds â cried Tashtego In long In-di-an file as when herons take wing the white birds were now all fly-ing towards Ahabâ s boat and when within a few yards be-gan flut-ter-ing over the water there wheel-ing round and round with joy-ous ex-pec-tant cries Their vi-sion was keen-er than manâ s Ahab could dis-cov-er no sign in the sea But sud-den-ly as he peered down and down in-to its depths he pro-found-ly saw a white liv-ing spot no big-ger than a white weasel with won-der-ful celer-i-ty upris-ing and mag-ni-fy-ing as it rose till it turned and then there were plain-ly re-vealed two long crooked rows of white glis-ten-ing teeth float-ing up from the undis-cov-er-able bot-tom It was Mo-by Dickâ s open mouth and scrolled jaw his vast shad-owed bulk still half blend-ing with the blue of the sea The glit-ter-ing mouth yawned be-neath the boat like an open doored mar-ble tomb and giv-ing one side-long sweep with his steer-ing oar Ahab whirled the craft aside from this tre-men-dous ap-pari-tion Then calling upon Fedal-lah to change places with him went for-ward to the bows and seiz-ing Perthâ s har-poon com-mand-ed his crew to grasp their oars and stand by to stern Now by rea-son of this time-ly spin-ning round the boat upon its ax-is its bow by an-tic-i-pa-tion was made to face the whaleâ s head while yet un-der water But as if per-ceiv-ing this stratagem Mo-by Dick with that ma-li-cious in-tel-li-gence ascribed to him sidel-ing-ly trans-plant-ed him-self as it were in an in-stant shoot-ing his pleat-ed head length-wise be-neath the boat Through and through through every plank and each rib it thrilled for an in-stant the whale oblique-ly ly-ing on his back in the man-ner of a bit-ing shark slow-ly and feel-ing-ly tak-ing its bows full within his mouth so that the long nar-row scrolled low-er jaw curled high up in-to the open air and one of the teeth caught in a row lock The bluish pearl white of the in-side of the jaw was within six inch-es of Ahabâ s head and reached higher than that In this at-ti-tude the White Whale now shook the slight cedar as a mild-ly cru-el cat her mouse With unas-ton-ished eyes Fedal-lah gazed and crossed his ar-ms but the tiger yel-low crew were tum-bling over each otherâ s heads to gain the ut-ter-most stern And now while both elas-tic gun-wales were spring-ing in and out as the whale dal-lied with the doomed craft in this devil-ish way and from his body be-ing sub-merged be-neath the boat he could not be dart-ed at from the bows for the bows were al-most in-side of him as it were and while the other boats in-vol-un-tar-i-ly paused as be-fore a quick cri-sis im-pos-si-ble to with-stand then it was that mono-ma-ni-ac Ahab fu-ri-ous with this tan-taliz-ing vicin-i-ty of his foe which placed him all alive and help-less in the very jaws he hat-ed fren-zied with all this he seized the long bone with his naked hands and wild-ly strove to wrench it from its gripe As now he thus vain-ly strove the jaw slipped from him the frail gun-wales bent in col-lapsed and snapped as both jaws like an enor-mous shears slid-ing fur-ther aft bit the craft com-plete-ly in twain and locked them-selves fast again in the sea mid-way between the two float-ing wrecks Th-ese float-ed aside the bro-ken ends droop-ing the crew at the stern wreck cling-ing to the gun-wales and striv-ing to hold fast to the oars to lash them across At that pre-lud-ing mo-ment ere the boat was yet snapped Ahab the first to per-ceive the whaleâ s in-tent by the crafty uprais-ing of his head a move-ment that loosed his hold for the time at that mo-ment his hand had made one fi-nal ef-fort to push the boat out of the bite But on-ly slip-ping fur-ther in-to the whaleâ s mouth and tilt-ing over side-ways as it slipped the boat had shak-en off his hold on the jaw spilled him out of it as he leaned to the push and so he fell flat faced upon the sea Rip-pling-ly with-draw-ing from his prey Mo-by Dick now lay at a lit-tle dis-tance ver-ti-cal-ly thrust-ing his ob-long white head up and down in the bil-lows and at the same time slow-ly re-volv-ing his whole spin-dled body so that when his vast wrin-kled fore-head roseâ some twen-ty or more feet out of the waterâ the now ris-ing swells with all their con-flu-ent waves daz-zling-ly broke against it vin-dic-tive-ly toss-ing their shivered spray still higher in-to the air So in a gale the but half baf-fled Chan-nel bil-lows on-ly re-coil from the base of the Ed-dy-s-tone tri-umphant-ly to over-leap its sum-mit with their scud This mo-tion is pe-cu-liar to the sperm whale It re-ceives its des-ig-na-tion pitch-pol-ing from its be-ing likened to that pre-lim-i-nary up and down poise of the whale lance in the ex-er-cise called pitch-pol-ing pre-vi-ous-ly de-scribed By this mo-tion the whale must best and most com-pre-hen-sive-ly view what-ev-er ob-jec-ts may be en-cir-cling him But soon re-sum-ing his hor-i-zon-tal at-ti-tude Mo-by Dick swam swift-ly round and round the wrecked crew side-ways churn-ing the water in his venge-ful wake as if lash-ing him-self up to still another and more dead-ly as-sault The sight of the splin-tered boat seemed to mad-den him as the blood of grapes and mul-ber-ries cast be-fore An-ti-ochusâ s ele-phan-ts in the book of Mac-cabees Mean-while Ahab half smoth-ered in the foam of the whaleâ s in-so-lent tail and too much of a crip-ple to swim â though he could still keep afloat even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that help-less Ahabâ s head was seen like a tossed bub-ble which the least chance shock might burst From the boatâ s frag-men-tary stern Fedal-lah in-cu-ri-ous-ly and mild-ly eyed him the cling-ing crew at the other drift-ing end could not suc-cor him more than enough was it for them to look to them-selves For so re-volv-ing-ly ap-palling was the White Whaleâ s aspect and so plan-e-tar-i-ly swift the ever con-tract-ing cir-cles he made that he seemed hor-i-zon-tal-ly swoop-ing upon them And though the other boats un-harmed still hovered hard by still they dared not pull in-to the ed-dy to strike lest that should be the sig-nal for the in-stant destruc-tion of the jeop-ar-dized cast-aways Ahab and all nor in that case could they them-selves hope to es-cape With strain-ing eyes then they re-mained on the outer edge of the dire-ful zone whose cen-tre had now be-come the old manâ s head Mean-time from the begin-ning all this had been de-scried from the shipâ s mast heads and squar-ing her yards she had borne down upon the scene and was now so nigh that Ahab in the water hailed her â â Sail on theâ â but that mo-ment a break-ing sea dashed on him from Mo-by Dick and whelmed him for the time But strug-gling out of it again and chanc-ing to rise on a tow-er-ing crest he shout-ed â â Sail on the whale â Drive him off â The Pe-quodâ s prows were point-ed and break-ing up the charmed cir-cle she ef-fec-tu-al-ly part-ed the white whale from his vic-tim As he sul-len-ly swam off the boats flew to the res-cue Dragged in-to Stub-bâ s boat with blood shot blind-ed eyes the white brine cak-ing in his wrin-kles the long ten-sion of Ahabâ s bodi-ly strength did crack and help-less-ly he yield-ed to his bodyâ s doom for a time ly-ing all crushed in the bot-tom of Stub-bâ s boat like one trod-den un-der foot of herds of ele-phan-ts Far in-land name-less wails came from him as deso-late sounds from out ravines But this in-ten-si-ty of his phys-i-cal pros-tra-tion did but so much the more ab-bre-vi-ate it In an in-stan-tâ s com-pass great hearts some-times con-dense to one deep pang the sum to-tal of those shal-low pains kind-ly dif-fused through fee-bler menâ s whole lives And so such hearts though sum-ma-ry in each one suf-fer-ing still if the gods de-cree it in their life time ag-gre-gate a whole age of woe whol-ly made up of in-stan-ta-neous in-ten-si-ties for even in their point-less cen-tres those noble na-tures con-tain the en-tire cir-cum-fer-ences of in-fe-ri-or souls â The har-poon â said Ahab half way ris-ing and drag-ging-ly lean-ing on one bend-ed ar-mâ â is it safe â â Aye sir for it was not dart-ed this is it â said Stubb show-ing it â Lay it be-fore me â any miss-ing men â â One two three four five â there were five oars sir and here are five men â â Thatâ s good â Help me man I wish to stand So so I see him there there go-ing to lee-ward still what a leap-ing spout â Hands off from me The eter-nal sap runs up in Ahabâ s bones again Set the sail out oars the helm â It is often the case that when a boat is stove its crew be-ing picked up by another boat help to work that se-cond boat and the chase is thus con-tin-ued with what is called dou-ble banked oars It was thus now But the added pow-er of the boat did not equal the added pow-er of the whale for he seemed to have tre-ble banked his every fin swim-ming with a ve-loc-i-ty which plain-ly showed that if now un-der th-ese cir-cum-stances pushed on the chase would prove an in-def-i-nite-ly pro-longed if not a hope-less one nor could any crew en-dure for so long a pe-ri-od such an un-in-ter-mit-ted in-tense strain-ing at the oar a thing bare-ly tol-er-a-ble on-ly in some one brief vi-cis-si-tude The ship it-self then as it some-times hap-pens of-fered the most promis-ing in-ter-me-di-ate means of over-tak-ing the chase Ac-cord-ing-ly the boats now made for her and were soon swayed up to their cranesâ the two parts of the wrecked boat hav-ing been pre-vi-ous-ly se-cured by herâ and then hoist-ing every-thing to her side and stack-ing her can-vas high up and side-ways out-stretch-ing it with stun sails like the dou-ble joint-ed wings of an al-ba-tross the Pe-quod bore down in the lee-ward wake of Mo-by Dick At the well known me-thod-ic in-ter-vals the whaleâ s glit-ter-ing spout was reg-u-lar-ly an-nounced from the manned mast heads and when he would be re-port-ed as just gone down Ahab would take the time and then pac-ing the deck bin-na-cle watch in hand so soon as the last se-cond of the al-lot-ted hour ex-pired his voice was heard â â Whose is the dou-bloon now Dâ ye see him â and if the re-ply was No sir straight-way he com-mand-ed them to lift him to his perch In this way the day wore on Ahab now aloft and mo-tion-less anon un-rest-ing-ly pac-ing the planks As he was thus walk-ing ut-ter-ing no sound ex-cept to hail the men aloft or to bid them hoist a sail still higher or to spread one to a still greater breadthâ thus to and fro pac-ing be-neath his slouched hat at every turn he passed his own wrecked boat which had been dropped upon the quar-ter deck and lay there re-v-ersed bro-ken bow to shat-tered stern At last he paused be-fore it and as in an al-ready over cloud-ed sky fresh troops of clouds will some-times sail across so over the old manâ s face there now stole some such added gloom as this Stubb saw him pause and per-haps in-tend-ing not vain-ly though to evince his own un-abat-ed for-ti-tude and thus keep up a valiant place in his Cap-tainâ s mind he ad-vanced and eye-ing the wreck ex-claimedâ â The this-tle the ass re-fused it pricked his mouth too keen-ly sir ha ha â â What soul-less thing is this that laughs be-fore a wreck Man man did I not know thee brave as fear-less fire and as me-chan-i-cal I could swear thou wert a poltroon Groan nor laugh should be heard be-fore a wreck â â Aye sir â said Star-buck draw-ing near â â tis a solemn sight an omen and an ill one â â Omen omen â the dic-tionary If the gods think to speak outright to man they will honor-ably speak outright not shake their heads and give an old wivesâ darkling hint â Be-gone Ye two are the op-po-site poles of one thing Star-buck is Stubb re-v-ersed and Stubb is Star-buck and ye two are all mankind and Ahab stands alone among the mil-lions of the peo-pled earth nor gods nor men his neigh-bors Cold coldâ I shiv-er â How now Aloft there Dâ ye see him Sing out for every spout though he spout ten times a se-cond â The day was near-ly done on-ly the hem of his gold-en robe was rustling Soon it was al-most dark but the look out men still re-mained unset â Canâ t see the spout now sir â too darkâ â cried a voice from the air â How head-ing when last seen â â As be-fore sir â straight to lee-ward â â Good he will trav-el slow-er now â tis night Down roy-als and top gal-lant stun sails Mr Star-buck We must not run over him be-fore morn-ing heâ s mak-ing a pas-sage now and may heave to a while Helm there keep her full be-fore the wind â Aloft come down â Mr Stubb send a fresh hand to the fore mast head and see it manned till morn-ing â â Then ad-vanc-ing towards the dou-bloon in the main mastâ â Men this gold is mine for I earned it but I shall let it abide here till the White Whale is dead and then whoso-ev-er of ye first rais-es him upon the day he shall be killed this gold is that manâ s and if on that day I shall again raise him then ten times its sum shall be di-vid-ed among all of ye Away now â the deck is thine sir â And so say-ing he placed him-self half way within the scut-tle and slouch-ing his hat stood there till dawn ex-cept when at in-ter-vals rous-ing him-self to see how the night wore on CHAPTER 134 The Chaseâ Se-cond Day At day break the three mast heads were punc-tu-al-ly manned afresh â Dâ ye see him â cried Ahab after al-low-ing a lit-tle space for the light to spread â See noth-ing sir â â Turn up all hands and make sail he trav-els faster than I thought for â the top gal-lant sails â aye they should have been kept on her all night But no mat-terâ â tis but rest-ing for the rush â Here be it said that this perti-na-cious pur-suit of one par-tic-u-lar whale con-tin-ued through day in-to night and through night in-to day is a thing by no means un-prece-dent-ed in the South sea fish-ery For such is the won-der-ful skill pre-science of ex-pe-ri-ence and in-vin-ci-ble con-fi-dence ac-quired by some great nat-u-ral ge-nius-es among the Nan-tuck-et com-man-ders that from the sim-ple ob-ser-va-tion of a whale when last de-scried they will un-der cer-tain giv-en cir-cum-stances pret-ty ac-cu-rate-ly foretell both the direc-tion in which he will con-tin-ue to swim for a time while out of sight as well as his prob-a-ble rate of pro-gres-sion dur-ing that pe-ri-od And in th-ese cas-es some-what as a pilot when about los-ing sight of a coast whose gen-er-al trend-ing he well knows and which he de-sires short-ly to re-turn to again but at some fur-ther point like as this pilot stands by his com-pass and takes the pre-cise bear-ing of the cape at pre-sent vis-i-ble in order the more cer-tain-ly to hit aright the re-mote unseen head-land even-tu-al-ly to be visit-ed so does the fish-er-man at his com-pass with the whale for after be-ing chased and dili-gent-ly marked through sev-er-al hours of day-light then when night ob-scures the fish the crea-tureâ s fu-ture wake through the dark-ness is al-most as estab-lished to the sa-ga-cious mind of the hunter as the pilotâ s coast is to him So that to this hun-terâ s won-drous skill the prover-bial evanes-cence of a thing writ in water a wake is to all de-sired pur-pos-es well nigh as reli-able as the stead-fast land And as the mighty iron Le-viathan of the modern rail-way is so fa-mil-iar-ly known in its every pace that with watch-es in their hands men time his rate as doc-tors that of a babyâ s pulse and light-ly say of it the up train or the down train will reach such or such a spot at such or such an hour even so al-most there are oc-ca-sions when th-ese Nan-tuck-eters time that other Le-viathan of the deep ac-cord-ing to the ob-served hu-mor of his speed and say to them-selves so many hours hence this whale will have gone two hun-dred miles will have about reached this or that de-gree of lat-i-tude or lon-gi-tude But to ren-der this acute-ness at all suc-cess-ful in the end the wind and the sea must be the whale-manâ s al-lies for of what pre-sent avail to the be-calmed or wind-bound mariner is the skill that as-sures him he is ex-act-ly nine-ty three leagues and a quar-ter from his port In-fer-able from th-ese state-men-ts are many col-lat-er-al subtile mat-ters touch-ing the chase of whales The ship tore on leav-ing such a fur-row in the sea as when a can-non ball mis-sent be-comes a plough share and turns up the lev-el field â By salt and hemp â cried Stubb â but this swift mo-tion of the deck creeps up oneâ s legs and tin-gles at the heart This ship and I are two brave fel-lows â Ha ha Some one take me up and launch me spine wise on the sea â for by live oaks my spineâ s a keel Ha ha we go the gait that leaves no dust be-hind â â There she blowsâ she blows â she blows â right ahead â was now the mast head cry â Aye aye â cried Stubb â I knew itâ ye canâ t es-capeâ blow on and split your spout O whale the mad fiend him-self is after ye blow your trumpâ blis-ter your lungs â Ahab will dam off your blood as a miller shuts his water-gate upon the stream â And Stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew The fren-zies of the chase had by this time worked them bub-bling-ly up like old wine worked anew What-ev-er pale fears and fore-bod-ings some of them might have felt be-fore th-ese were not on-ly now kept out of sight through the grow-ing awe of Ahab but they were bro-ken up and on all sides rout-ed as timid prair-ie hares that scat-ter be-fore the bound-ing bi-son The hand of Fate had snatched all their souls and by the stir-ring per-ils of the pre-vi-ous day the rack of the past nightâ s sus-pense the fixed un-fear-ing blind reck-less way in which their wild craft went plung-ing towards its fly-ing mark by all th-ese things their hearts were bowled along The wind that made great bel-lies of their sails and rushed the ves-sel on by ar-ms in-vis-i-ble as ir-re-sistible this seemed the sym-bol of that unseen agen-cy which so enslaved them to the race They were one man not thir-ty For as the one ship that held them all though it was put to-geth-er of all con-trast-ing thingsâ oak and maple and pine wood iron and pitch and hem-pâ yet all th-ese ran in-to each other in the one con-crete hull which shot on its way both balanced and direct-ed by the long cen-tral keel even so all the in-di-vid-u-al-i-ties of the crew this manâ s valor that manâ s fear guilt and guilti-ness all va-ri-eties were weld-ed in-to one-ness and were all direct-ed to that fatal goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did point to The rig-ging lived The mast heads like the tops of tall palms were out-spread-ing-ly tuft-ed with ar-ms and legs Cling-ing to a spar with one hand some reached forth the other with im-pa-tient wav-ings others shad-ing their eyes from the vivid sun-light sat far out on the rock-ing yards all the spars in full bear-ing of mor-tals ready and ripe for their fate Ah how they still strove through that in-fi-nite blue-ness to seek out the thing that might de-stroy them â Why sing ye not out for him if ye see him â cried Ahab when after the lapse of some min-utes since the first cry no more had been heard â Sway me up men ye have been de-ceived not Mo-by Dick casts one odd jet that way and then dis-ap-pears â It was even so in their head-long eager-ness the men had mis-tak-en some other thing for the whale spout as the event it-self soon proved for hard-ly had Ahab reached his perch hard-ly was the rope be-layed to its pin on deck when he struck the key note to an orches-tra that made the air vi-brate as with the com-bined dis-charges of ri-fles The tri-umphant hal-loo of thir-ty buck-skin lungs was heard asâ much nearer to the ship than the place of the imag-i-nary jet less than a mile aheadâ Mo-by Dick bodi-ly burst in-to view For not by any calm and in-do-lent spout-ings not by the peace-able gush of that mys-tic foun-tain in his head did the White Whale now re-veal his vicin-i-ty but by the far more won-drous phenomenon of breach-ing Ris-ing with his ut-most ve-loc-i-ty from the fur-thest depths the Sperm Whale thus booms his en-tire bulk in-to the pure ele-ment of air and pil-ing up a moun-tain of daz-zling foam shows his place to the dis-tance of seven miles and more In those mo-men-ts the torn en-raged waves he shakes off seem his mane in some cas-es this breach-ing is his act of de-fi-ance â There she breach-es there she breach-es â was the cry as in his im-mea-sur-able brava-does the White Whale tossed him-self sal-mon like to Heav-en So sud-den-ly seen in the blue plain of the sea and relieved against the still bluer mar-gin of the sky the spray that he raised for the mo-ment in-tol-er-a-bly glit-tered and glared like a glacier and stood there grad-u-al-ly fad-ing and fad-ing away from its first sparkling in-ten-si-ty to the dim misti-ness of an ad-vanc-ing show-er in a vale â Aye breach your last to the sun Mo-by Dick â cried Ahab â thy hour and thy har-poon are at hand â Down down all of ye but one man at the fore The boats â stand by â Un-mind-ful of the te-dious rope lad-ders of the shrouds the men like shoot-ing stars slid to the deck by the iso-lat-ed back-stays and hal-yards while Ahab less dart-ing-ly but still rapid-ly was dropped from his perch â Low-er away â he cried so soon as he had reached his boatâ a spare one rigged the after-noon pre-vi-ous â Mr Star-buck the ship is thineâ keep away from the boats but keep near them Low-er all â As if to strike a quick ter-ror in-to them by this time be-ing the first as-sailant him-self Mo-by Dick had turned and was now com-ing for the three crews Ahabâ s boat was cen-tral and cheer-ing his men he told them he would take the whale head and head â that is pull straight up to his fore-head â a not un-com-mon thing for when within a cer-tain lim-it such a course ex-cludes the com-ing onset from the whaleâ s side-long vi-sion But ere that close lim-it was gained and while yet all three boats were plain as the shipâ s three masts to his eye the White Whale churn-ing him-self in-to fu-ri-ous speed al-most in an in-stant as it were rush-ing among the boats with open jaws and a lash-ing tail of-fered ap-palling bat-tle on every side and heed-less of the irons dart-ed at him from every boat seemed on-ly in-tent on an-ni-hi-lat-ing each separate plank of which those boats were made But sk-il-ful-ly manÅ uvred inces-sant-ly wheel-ing like trained charg-ers in the field the boats for a while elud-ed him though at times but by a plankâ s breadth while all the time Ahabâ s un-earth-ly slo-gan tore every other cry but his to shreds But at last in his un-trace-able evo-lu-tions the White Whale so crossed and re-crossed and in a thou-sand ways en-tan-gled the slack of the three lines now fast to him that they fore-short-ened and of them-selves warped the devot-ed boats towards the plant-ed irons in him though now for a mo-ment the whale drew aside a lit-tle as if to ral-ly for a more tre-men-dous charge Seiz-ing that op-por-tu-ni-ty Ahab first paid out more line and then was rapid-ly haul-ing and jerk-ing in upon it againâ hop-ing that way to disen-cum-ber it of some snarl-sâ when lo â a sight more sav-age than the em-bat-tled teeth of sharks Caught and twist-edâ corkscrewed in the mazes of the line loose har-poons and lances with all their bristling bar-bs and poin-ts came flash-ing and drip-ping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahabâ s boat On-ly one thing could be done Seiz-ing the boat knife he crit-i-cal-ly reached withinâ throughâ and then withoutâ the rays of steel dragged in the line beyond passed it in-board to the bows-man and then twice sun-der-ing the rope near the chock-sâ dropped the in-ter-cept-ed fagot of steel in-to the sea and was all fast again That in-stant the White Whale made a sud-den rush among the re-main-ing tan-gles of the other lines by so do-ing ir-re-sistibly dragged the more in-volved boats of Stubb and Flask towards his flukes dashed them to-geth-er like two rolling husks on a surf beat-en beach and then div-ing down in-to the sea dis-ap-peared in a boil-ing mael-strom in which for a space the odorous cedar chips of the wrecks danced round and round like the grat-ed nut-meg in a swift-ly stirred bowl of punch While the two crews were yet cir-cling in the waters reach-ing out after the re-volv-ing line tubs oars and other float-ing fur-ni-ture while as-lope lit-tle Flask bobbed up and down like an emp-ty vial twitch-ing his legs up-wards to es-cape the dread-ed jaws of sharks and Stubb was lusti-ly sing-ing out for some one to la-dle him up and while the old manâ s lineâ now part-ingâ ad-mit-ted of his pulling in-to the creamy pool to res-cue whom he could â in that wild si-mul-ta-ne-ous-ness of a thou-sand con-cret-ed per-ils â Ahabâ s yet un-strick-en boat seemed drawn up towards Heav-en by in-vis-i-ble wires â as ar-row like shoot-ing per-pen-dic-u-lar-ly from the sea the White Whale dashed his broad fore-head against its bot-tom and sent it turn-ing over and over in-to the air till it fell againâ gun-wale down-ward-sâ and Ahab and his men strug-gled out from un-der it like seals from a sea side cave The first upris-ing mo-men-tum of the whaleâ mod-i-fy-ing its direc-tion as he struck the sur-faceâ in-vol-un-tar-i-ly launched him along it to a lit-tle dis-tance from the cen-tre of the destruc-tion he had made and with his back to it he now lay for a mo-ment slow-ly feel-ing with his flukes from side to side and when-ev-er a stray oar bit of plank the least chip or crumb of the boats touched his skin his tail swift-ly drew back and came side-ways smit-ing the sea But soon as if sat-is-fied that his work for that time was done he pushed his pleat-ed fore-head through the ocean and trail-ing after him the in-ter-tan-gled lines con-tin-ued his lee-ward way at a trav-ellerâ s me-thod-ic pace As be-fore the at-ten-tive ship hav-ing de-scried the whole fight again came bear-ing down to the res-cue and drop-ping a boat picked up the float-ing mariners tubs oars and what-ev-er else could be caught at and safe-ly land-ed them on her decks Some sprained shoul-ders wrists and an-kles livid con-tu-sions wrenched har-poons and lances inex-tri-ca-ble in-tri-ca-cies of rope shat-tered oars and planks all th-ese were there but no fatal or even se-ri-ous ill seemed to have be-fall-en any one As with Fedal-lah the day be-fore so Ahab was now found grim-ly cling-ing to his boatâ s bro-ken half which af-ford-ed a com-par-a-tive-ly easy float nor did it so ex-haust him as the pre-vi-ous dayâ s mishap But when he was helped to the deck all eyes were fas-tened upon him as in-stead of stand-ing by him-self he still half hung upon the shoul-der of Star-buck who had thus far been the fore-most to as-sist him His ivory leg had been snapped off leav-ing but one short sharp splin-ter â Aye aye Star-buck â tis sweet to lean some-times be the lean-er who he will and would old Ahab had leaned often-er than he has â â The fer-rule has not stood sir â said the car-pen-ter now com-ing up â I put good work in-to that leg â â But no bones bro-ken sir I hope â said Stubb with true con-cern â Aye and all splin-tered to pieces Stubb â dâ ye see it â But even with a bro-ken bone old Ahab is un-touched and I ac-count no liv-ing bone of mine one jot more me than this dead one thatâ s lost Nor white whale nor man nor fiend can so much as graze old Ahab in his own prop-er and inac-ces-si-ble be-ing Can any lead touch yon-der floor any mast scrape yon-der roof â Aloft there which way â â Dead to lee-ward sir â â Up helm then pile on the sail again ship keep-ers down the rest of the spare boats and rig themâ Mr Star-buck away and muster the boatâ s crews â â Let me first help thee towards the bul-warks sir â â Oh oh oh how this splin-ter gores me now Ac-cursed fate that the un-con-quer-able cap-tain in the soul should have such a craven mate â â Sir â â My body man not thee Give me some-thing for a caneâ there that shivered lance will do Muster the men Sure-ly I have not seen him yet By heav-en it can-not be â miss-ing â quick call them all â The old manâ s hint-ed thought was true Upon mus-ter-ing the com-pa-ny the Parsee was not there â The Parsee â cried Stub-bâ â he must have been caught inâ â â â The black vomit wrench thee â run all of ye above alow cabin fore-castleâ find himâ not goneâ not gone â But quick-ly they re-turned to him with the tid-ings that the Parsee was nowhere to be found â Aye sir â said Stub-bâ â caught among the tan-gles of your lineâ I thought I saw him drag-ging un-der â â My line my line Gone â gone What means that lit-tle word â What death knell rings in it that old Ahab shakes as if he were the bel-fry The har-poon too â toss over the lit-ter there â dâ ye see it â the forged iron men the white whaleâ sâ no no no â blis-tered fool this hand did dart it â â tis in the fish â Aloft there Keep him nailedâ Quick â all hands to the rig-ging of the boat-sâ col-lect the oarsâ har-pooneers the irons the irons â hoist the roy-als higherâ a pull on all the sheets â helm there steady steady for your life Iâ ll ten times gir-dle the un-mea-sured globe yea and dive straight through it but Iâ ll slay him yet â â Great God but for one sin-gle in-stant show thy-self â cried Star-buck â nev-er nev-er wilt thou cap-ture him old manâ In Je-susâ name no more of this thatâ s worse than devilâ s mad-ness Two days chased twice stove to splin-ters thy very leg once more snatched from un-der thee thy evil shad-ow goneâ all good an-gels mob-bing thee with warn-ings â what more wouldst thou have â Shall we keep chas-ing this mur-der-ous fish till he swamps the last man Shall we be dragged by him to the bot-tom of the sea Shall we be towed by him to the in-fer-nal world Oh oh â Impi-ety and blas-phe-my to hunt him more â â Star-buck of late Iâ ve felt strange-ly moved to thee ever since that hour we both sawâ thou knowâ st what in one anotherâ s eyes But in this mat-ter of the whale be the front of thy face to me as the palm of this handâ a li-p-less un-fea-tured blank Ahab is for ever Ahab man This whole ac-tâ s im-mutably de-creed â Twas re-hearsed by thee and me a bil-lion years be-fore this ocean rolled Fool I am the Fatesâ lieu-tenant I act un-der orders Look thou un-der-ling that thou obeyest mine â Stand round me men Ye see an old man cut down to the stump lean-ing on a shivered lance propped up on a lone-ly foot â Tis Ahabâ his bodyâ s part but Ahabâ s soulâ s a cen-tipede that moves upon a hun-dred legs I feel strained half strand-ed as ropes that tow dis-mast-ed fri-gates in a gale and I may look so But ere I break yeâ ll hear me crack and till ye hear that know that Ahabâ s hawser tows his pur-pose yet Believe ye men in the things called omens Then laugh aloud and cry en-core For ere they drown drown-ing things will twice rise to the sur-face then rise again to sink for ever-more So with Mo-by Dickâ two days heâ s float-edâ to-mor-row will be the third Aye men heâ ll rise once more â but on-ly to spout his last Dâ ye feel brave men brave â â As fear-less fire â cried Stubb â And as me-chan-i-cal â mut-tered Ahab Then as the men went for-ward he mut-tered on â The things called omens And yes-ter-day I talked the same to Star-buck there con-cern-ing my bro-ken boat Oh how valiant-ly I seek to drive out of other-sâ hearts whatâ s clinched so fast in mine â The Parseeâ the Parsee â gone gone and he was to go be-fore â but still was to be seen again ere I could per-ishâ Howâ s that â Thereâ s a rid-dle now might baf-fle all the lawyers backed by the ghosts of the whole line of judges â like a hawkâ s beak it pecks my brain Iâ ll Iâ ll solve it though â When dusk descend-ed the whale was still in sight to lee-ward So once more the sail was short-ened and every-thing passed near-ly as on the pre-vi-ous night on-ly the sound of ham-mers and the hum of the grind-stone was heard till near-ly day-light as the men toiled by lan-terns in the com-plete and care-ful rig-ging of the spare boats and sharp-en-ing their fresh weapons for the mor-row Mean-time of the bro-ken keel of Ahabâ s wrecked craft the car-pen-ter made him another leg while still as on the night be-fore slouched Ahab stood fixed within his scut-tle his hid he-liotrope glance an-tic-i-pat-ing-ly gone back-ward on its dial sat due east-ward for the ear-li-est sun CHAPTER 135 The Chase â Third Day The morn-ing of the third day dawned fair and fresh and once more the soli-tary night man at the fore mast head was relieved by crowds of the day-light look outs who dot-ted every mast and al-most every spar â Dâ ye see him â cried Ahab but the whale was not yet in sight â In his in-fal-li-ble wake though but fol-low that wake thatâ s all Helm there steady as thou goest and hast been go-ing What a love-ly day again were it a new made world and made for a sum-mer house to the an-gels and this morn-ing the first of its throw-ing open to them a fairer day could not dawn upon that world Hereâ s food for thought had Ahab time to think but Ahab nev-er thinks he on-ly feels feels feels thatâ s tin-gling enough for mor-tal man to thinkâ s au-dac-i-ty God on-ly has that right and priv-i-lege Think-ing is or ought to be a cool-ness and a calm-ness and our poor hearts throb and our poor brains beat too much for that And yet Iâ ve some-times thought my brain was very calmâ frozen calm this old skull cracks so like a glass in which the con-tents turned to ice and shiv-er it And still this hair is grow-ing now this mo-ment grow-ing and heat must breed it but no itâ s like that sort of com-mon grass that will grow any-where between the earthy clefts of Green-land ice or in Ve-su-vius la-va How the wild winds blow it they whip it about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash the tossed ship they cling to A vile wind that has no doubt blown ere this through pri-son cor-ri-dors and cel-ls and wards of hospi-tals and ven-ti-lat-ed them and now comes blow-ing hither as in-no-cent as fleeces Out upon it â itâ s taint-ed Were I the wind Iâ d blow no more on such a wicked mis-er-able world Iâ d crawl some-where to a cave and slink there And yet â tis a noble and heroic thing the wind who ever con-quered it In every fight it has the last and bit-ter-est blow Run tilt-ing at it and you but run through it Ha a coward wind that strikes stark naked men but will not stand to re-ceive a sin-gle blow Even Ahab is a braver thingâ a nobler thing than that Would now the wind but had a body but all the things that most ex-as-per-ate and ou-trage mor-tal man all th-ese things are bodi-less but on-ly bodi-less as ob-jec-ts not as agen-ts Thereâ s a most spe-cial a most cun-ning oh a most ma-li-cious dif-fer-ence And yet I say again and swear it now that thereâ s some-thing all glo-ri-ous and gra-cious in the wind Th-ese warm Trade Winds at least that in the clear heav-ens blow straight on in strong and stead-fast vig-or-ous mild-ness and veer not from their mark how-ev-er the bas-er cur-ren-ts of the sea may turn and tack and might-i-est Mis-sis-sip-pies of the land swift and sw-erve about uncer-tain where to go at last And by the eter-nal Poles th-ese same Trades that so direct-ly blow my good ship on th-ese Trades or some-thing like themâ some-thing so un-change-able and full as strong blow my keeled soul along To it Aloft there What dâ ye see â â Noth-ing sir â â Noth-ing and noon at hand The dou-bloon goes a beg-ging See the sun Aye aye it must be so Iâ ve over-sailed him How got the start Aye heâ s chas-ing me now not I him â thatâ s bad I might have known it too Fool the li-nesâ the har-poons heâ s tow-ing Aye aye I have run him by last night About about Come down all of ye but the reg-u-lar look outs Man the braces â Steer-ing as she had done the wind had been some-what on the Pe-quodâ s quar-ter so that now be-ing point-ed in the re-v-erse direc-tion the braced ship sailed hard upon the breeze as she rechurned the cream in her own white wake â Against the wind he now steers for the open jaw â mur-mured Star-buck to him-self as he coiled the new hauled main brace upon the rail â God keep us but al-ready my bones feel damp within me and from the in-side wet my flesh I mis-doubt me that I disobey my God in obey-ing him â â Stand by to sway me up â cried Ahab ad-vanc-ing to the hem-pen bas-ket â We should meet him soon â â Aye aye sir â and straight-way Star-buck did Ahabâ s bid-ding and once more Ahab swung on high A whole hour now passed gold beat-en out to ages Time it-self now held long breaths with keen sus-pense But at last some three poin-ts off the weather bow Ahab de-scried the spout again and in-stant-ly from the three mast heads three shrieks went up as if the tongues of fire had voiced it â Fore-head to fore-head I meet thee this third time Mo-by Dick On deck there â brace sharp-er up crowd her in-to the windâ s eye Heâ s too far off to low-er yet Mr Star-buck The sails shake Stand over that helms-man with a top maul So so he trav-els fast and I must down But let me have one more good round look aloft here at the sea thereâ s time for that An old old sight and yet some-how so young aye and not changed a wink since I first saw it a boy from the sand hil-ls of Nan-tuck-et The same â the same â the same to Noah as to me Thereâ s a soft show-er to lee-ward Such love-ly lee-ward-ings They must lead some-whereâ to some-thing else than com-mon land more palmy than the palms Lee-ward the white whale goes that way look to wind-ward then the bet-ter if the bit-terer quar-ter But good bye good bye old mast head Whatâ s this â green aye tiny moss-es in th-ese warped cracks No such green weather stains on Ahabâ s head Thereâ s the dif-fer-ence now between manâ s old age and mat-terâ s But aye old mast we both grow old to-geth-er sound in our hul-ls though are we not my ship Aye mi-nus a leg thatâ s all By heav-en this dead wood has the bet-ter of my live flesh every way I canâ t com-pare with it and Iâ ve known some ships made of dead trees out-last the lives of men made of the most vi-tal stuff of vi-tal fathers Whatâ s that he said he should still go be-fore me my pilot and yet to be seen again But where Will I have eyes at the bot-tom of the sea sup-pos-ing I descend those end-less stairs and all night Iâ ve been sail-ing from him wher-ev-er he did sink to Aye aye like many more thou toldâ st dire-ful truth as touch-ing thy-self O Parsee but Ahab there thy shot fell short Good bye mast headâ keep a good eye upon the whale the while Iâ m gone Weâ ll talk to mor-row nay to night when the white whale lies down there tied by head and tail â He gave the word and still gaz-ing round him was steadi-ly low-ered through the cloven blue air to the deck In due time the boats were low-ered but as stand-ing in his shal-lopâ s stern Ahab just hovered upon the point of the des-cent he waved to the mate â who held one of the tack-le ropes on deckâ and bade him pause â Star-buck â â Sir â â For the third time my soulâ s ship starts upon this voy-age Star-buck â â Aye sir thou wilt have it so â â Some ships sail from their ports and ever after-wards are miss-ing Star-buck â â Truth sir sad-dest truth â â Some men die at ebb tide some at low water some at the full of the flood â and I feel now like a bil-low thatâ s all one crest-ed comb Star-buck I am old â shake hands with me man â Their hands met their eyes fas-tened Star-buckâ s tears the glue â Oh my cap-tain my cap-tain â noble heartâ go notâ go not â see itâ s a brave man that weeps how great the agony of the per-sua-sion then â â Low-er away â â cried Ahab toss-ing the mateâ s arm from him â Stand by the crew â In an in-stant the boat was pulling round close un-der the stern â The sharks the sharks â cried a voice from the low cabin win-dow there â O master my master come back â But Ahab heard noth-ing for his own voice was high lift-ed then and the boat leaped on Yet the voice spake true for scarce had he pushed from the ship when num-bers of sharks seem-ing-ly ris-ing from out the dark waters be-neath the hull ma-li-cious-ly snapped at the blades of the oars every time they dipped in the water and in this way ac-com-pa-nied the boat with their bites It is a thing not un-com-mon-ly hap-pen-ing to the whale boats in those swarm-ing seas the sharks at times ap-par-ent-ly fol-low-ing them in the same pre-scient way that vul-tures hover over the ban-ners of march-ing reg-i-men-ts in the east But th-ese were the first sharks that had been ob-served by the Pe-quod since the White Whale had been first de-scried and whether it was that Ahabâ s crew were all such tiger yel-low bar-bar-ians and there-fore their flesh more musky to the sens-es of the shark-sâ a mat-ter some-times well known to af-fect them â how-ev-er it was they seemed to fol-low that one boat without molest-ing the others â Heart of wrought steel â mur-mured Star-buck gaz-ing over the side and fol-low-ing with his eyes the re-ced-ing boatâ â canst thou yet ring bold-ly to that sight â low-er-ing thy keel among raven-ing sharks and fol-lowed by them open mouthed to the chase and this the crit-i-cal third day â For when three days flow to-geth-er in one con-tin-u-ous in-tense pur-suit be sure the first is the morn-ing the se-cond the noon and the third the even-ing and the end of that thingâ be that end what it may Oh my God what is this that shoots through me and leaves me so dead-ly calm yet ex-pec-tant â fixed at the top of a shud-der Fu-ture things swim be-fore me as in emp-ty out-lines and skele-tons all the past is some-how grown dim Mary girl thou fadest in pale glo-ries be-hind me boy I seem to see but thy eyes grown won-drous blue Strangest prob-lems of life seem clear-ing but clouds sweep betweenâ Is my jour-neyâ s end com-ing My legs feel faint like his who has foot-ed it all day Feel thy heart â beats it yet Stir thy-self Star-buck â stave it of-fâ move move speak aloud â Mast head there See ye my boyâ s hand on the hill â Crazed â aloft there â keep thy keen-est eye upon the boats â mark

thou that sight oh Ahab â shud-der shud-der â The boats had not gone very far when by a sig-nal from the mast head-sâ a down-ward point-ed arm Ahab knew that the whale had sound-ed but in-tend-ing to be near him at the next ris-ing he held on his way a lit-tle side-ways from the ves-sel the becharmed crew main-tain-ing the pro-found-est si-lence as the head beat waves ham-mered and ham-mered against the op-pos-ing bow â Drive drive in your nails oh ye waves to their ut-ter-most heads drive them in ye but strike a thing without a lid and no cof-fin and no hearse can be mine â and hemp on-ly can kill me Ha ha â Sud-den-ly the waters around them slow-ly swelled in broad cir-cles then quick-ly upheaved as if side-ways slid-ing from a sub-merged berg of ice swift-ly ris-ing to the sur-face A low rum-bling sound was heard a subter-ra-ne-ous hum and then all held their breaths as be-drag-gled with trail-ing ropes and har-poons and lances a vast form shot length-wise but oblique-ly from the sea Shroud-ed in a thin droop-ing veil of mist it hovered for a mo-ment in the rain-bowed air and then fell swamp-ing back in-to the deep Crushed thir-ty feet up-wards the waters flashed for an in-stant like heaps of foun-tains then bro-ken-ly sank in a show-er of flakes leav-ing the cir-cling sur-face creamed like new milk round the mar-ble trunk of the whale â Give way â cried Ahab to the oars-men and the boats dart-ed for-ward to the at-tack but mad-dened by yes-ter-dayâ s fresh irons that cor-rod-ed in him Mo-by Dick seemed com-bined-ly possessed by all the an-gels that fell from heav-en The wide tiers of weld-ed ten-dons over-spread-ing his broad white fore-head be-neath the trans-par-ent skin looked knit-ted to-geth-er as head on he came churn-ing his tail among the boats and once more flailed them apart spilling out the irons and lances from the two matesâ boats and dash-ing in one side of the up-per part of their bows but leav-ing Ahabâ s al-most without a scar While Dag-goo and Quee-queg were stop-ping the strained planks and as the whale swim-ming out from them turned and showed one en-tire flank as he shot by them again at that mo-ment a quick cry went up Lashed round and round to the fishâ s back pin-ioned in the turns upon turns in which dur-ing the past night the whale had reeled the in-vo-lu-tions of the lines around him the half torn body of the Parsee was seen his sable rai-ment frayed to shreds his dis-tend-ed eyes turned full upon old Ahab The har-poon dropped from his hand â Be-fooled be-fooled â â draw-ing in a long lean breathâ â Aye Parsee I see thee again â Aye and thou goest be-fore and this this then is the hearse that thou didst promise But I hold thee to the last let-ter of thy word Where is the se-cond hearse Away mates to the ship those boats are use-less now re-pair them if ye can in time and re-turn to me if not Ahab is enough to dieâ Down men the first thing that but of-fers to jump from this boat I stand in that thing I har-poon Ye are not other men but my ar-ms and my legs and so obey me â Whereâ s the whale gone down again â But he looked too nigh the boat for as if bent upon es-cap-ing with the corpse he bore and as if the par-tic-u-lar place of the last en-counter had been but a stage in his lee-ward voy-age Mo-by Dick was now again steadi-ly swim-ming for-ward and had al-most passed the ship â which thus far had been sail-ing in the con-trary direc-tion to him though for the pre-sent her head-way had been stopped He seemed swim-ming with his ut-most ve-loc-i-ty and now on-ly in-tent upon pur-su-ing his own straight path in the sea â Oh Ahab â cried Star-buck â not too late is it even now the third day to de-sist See Mo-by Dick seeks thee not It is thou thou that mad-ly seek-est him â Set-ting sail to the ris-ing wind the lone-ly boat was swift-ly im-pelled to lee-ward by both oars and can-vas And at last when Ahab was slid-ing by the ves-sel so near as plain-ly to distin-guish Star-buckâ s face as he leaned over the rail he hailed him to turn the ves-sel about and fol-low him not too swift-ly at a ju-di-cious in-ter-val Glanc-ing up-wards he saw Tashtego Quee-queg and Dag-goo eager-ly mount-ing to the three mast heads while the oars-men were rock-ing in the two staved boats which had but just been hoist-ed to the side and were busi-ly at work in re-pair-ing them One after the other through the port holes as he sped he al-so caught fly-ing glimpses of Stubb and Flask busy-ing them-selves on deck among bun-dles of new irons and lances As he saw all this as he heard the ham-mers in the bro-ken boats far other ham-mers seemed driv-ing a nail in-to his heart But he ral-lied And now mark-ing that the vane or flag was gone from the main mast head he shout-ed to Tashtego who had just gained that perch to descend again for another flag and a ham-mer and nails and so nail it to the mast Whether fagged by the three daysâ run-ning chase and the re-sis-tance to his swim-ming in the knot-ted ham-per he bore or whether it was some la-tent de-ceit-ful-ness and mal-ice in him whichev-er was true the White Whaleâ s way now be-gan to abate as it seemed from the boat so rapid-ly near-ing him once more though in-deed the whaleâ s last start had not been so long a one as be-fore And still as Ahab glid-ed over the waves the un-pity-ing sharks ac-com-pa-nied him and so perti-na-cious-ly stuck to the boat and so con-tin-u-al-ly bit at the ply-ing oars that the blades be-came jagged and crunched and left small splin-ters in the sea at al-most every dip â Heed them not those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars Pull on â tis the bet-ter rest the sharkâ s jaw than the yield-ing water â â But at every bite sir the thin blades grow smaller and smaller â â They will last long enough pull on â But who can tel-lâ â he mut-teredâ â whether th-ese sharks swim to feast on the whale or on Ahab â But pull on Aye all alive nowâ we near him The helm take the helm let me pass â â and so say-ing two of the oars-men helped him for-ward to the bows of the still fly-ing boat At length as the craft was cast to one side and ran rang-ing along with the White Whaleâ s flank he seemed strange-ly obliv-i-ous of its ad-vanceâ as the whale some-times wil-lâ and Ahab was fair-ly within the smoky moun-tain mist which thrown off from the whaleâ s spout curled round his great Mon-ad-nock hump he was even thus close to him when with body arched back and both ar-ms length-wise high lift-ed to the poise he dart-ed his fierce iron and his far fiercer curse in-to the hat-ed whale As both steel and curse sank to the sock-et as if sucked in-to a mo-rass Mo-by Dick side-ways writhed spas-mod-i-cal-ly rolled his nigh flank against the bow and without staving a hole in it so sud-den-ly cant-ed the boat over that had it not been for the el-e-vat-ed part of the gun-wale to which he then clung Ahab would once more have been tossed in-to the sea As it was three of the oars-menâ who foreknew not the pre-cise in-stant of the dart and were there-fore un-pre-pared for its ef-fect-sâ th-ese were flung out but so fell that in an in-stant two of them clutched the gun-wale again and ris-ing to its lev-el on a comb-ing wave hurled them-selves bodi-ly in-board again the third man help-less-ly drop-ping astern but still afloat and swim-ming Al-most si-mul-ta-ne-ous-ly with a mighty vo-li-tion of un-grad-u-at-ed in-stan-ta-neous swift-ness the White Whale dart-ed through the wel-ter-ing sea But when Ahab cried out to the steers-man to take new turns with the line and hold it so and com-mand-ed the crew to turn round on their seats and tow the boat up to the mark the mo-ment the treach-er-ous line felt that dou-ble strain and tug it snapped in the emp-ty air â What breaks in me Some sinew cracks â â tis whole again oars oars Burst in upon him â Hear-ing the tre-men-dous rush of the sea crash-ing boat the whale wheeled round to pre-sent his blank fore-head at bay but in that evo-lu-tion catch-ing sight of the near-ing black hull of the ship seem-ing-ly see-ing in it the source of all his per-se-cu-tions be-think-ing itâ it may beâ a larg-er and nobler foe of a sud-den he bore down upon its ad-vanc-ing prow smit-ing his jaws amid fiery show-ers of foam Ahab stag-gered his hand smote his fore-head â I grow blind hands stretch out be-fore me that I may yet grope my way Isâ t night â â The whale The ship â cried the cring-ing oars-men â Oars oars Slope down-wards to thy depths O sea that ere it be for ever too late Ahab may slide this last last time upon his mark I see the ship the ship Dash on my men Will ye not save my ship â But as the oars-men vi-o-lent-ly forced their boat through the sledge ham-mer-ing seas the be-fore whale smit-ten bow ends of two planks burst through and in an in-stant al-most the tem-porar-i-ly dis-abled boat lay near-ly lev-el with the waves its half wad-ing splash-ing crew try-ing hard to stop the gap and bale out the pour-ing water Mean-time for that one be-hold-ing in-stant Tashte-goâ s mast head ham-mer re-mained sus-pend-ed in his hand and the red flag half wrap-ping him as with a plaid then streamed it-self straight out from him as his own for-ward flow-ing heart while Star-buck and Stubb stand-ing upon the bowsprit be-neath caught sight of the down com-ing mon-ster just as soon as he â The whale the whale Up helm up helm Oh all ye sweet pow-ers of air now hug me close Let not Star-buck die if die he must in a wo-manâ s faint-ing fit Up helm I sayâ ye fools the jaw the jaw Is this the end of all my burst-ing pray-ers all my life long fideli-ties Oh Ahab Ahab lo thy work Steady helms-man steady Nay nay Up helm again He turns to meet us Oh his unap-peasable brow drives on towards one whose du-ty tel-ls him he can-not depart My God stand by me now â â Stand not by me but stand un-der me who-ev-er you are that will now help Stubb for Stubb too sticks here I grin at thee thou grin-ning whale Who ever helped Stubb or kept Stubb awake but Stub-bâ s own un-wink-ing eye And now poor Stubb goes to bed upon a mat-trass that is all too soft would it were stuffed with brush-wood I grin at thee thou grin-ning whale Look ye sun moon and stars I call ye as-sas-sins of as good a fel-low as ever spout-ed up his ghost For all that I would yet ring glass-es with ye would ye but hand the cup Oh oh oh oh thou grin-ning whale but thereâ ll be plen-ty of gulp-ing soon Why fly ye not O Ahab For me off shoes and jack-et to it let Stubb die in his draw-ers A most mouldy and over salt-ed death though â cher-ries cher-ries cher-ries Oh Flask for one red cher-ry ere we die â â Cher-ries I on-ly wish that we were where they grow Oh Stubb I hope my poor motherâ s drawn my part pay ere this if not few cop-pers will now come to her for the voy-age is up â From the shipâ s bows near-ly all the sea-men now hung in-ac-tive ham-mers bits of plank lances and har-poons me-chan-i-cal-ly re-tained in their hands just as they had dart-ed from their var-i-ous em-ploy-men-ts all their en-chant-ed eyes in-tent upon the whale which from side to side strange-ly vi-brat-ing his pre-des-ti-nat-ing head sent a broad band of over-spread-ing semi-cir-cu-lar foam be-fore him as he rushed Retri-bu-tion swift vengeance eter-nal mal-ice were in his whole aspect and spite of all that mor-tal man could do the sol-id white but-tress of his fore-head smote the shipâ s star-board bow till men and tim-bers reeled Some fell flat upon their faces Like dis-lodged trucks the heads of the har-pooneers aloft shook on their bull like necks Through the breach they heard the waters pour as moun-tain tor-ren-ts down a flume â The ship The hearse â the se-cond hearse â cried Ahab from the boat â its wood could on-ly be Amer-i-can â Div-ing be-neath the set-tling ship the whale ran quiv-er-ing along its keel but turn-ing un-der water swift-ly shot to the sur-face again far off the other bow but within a few yards of Ahabâ s boat where for a time he lay qui-es-cent â I turn my body from the sun What ho Tashtego let me hear thy ham-mer Oh ye three un-sur-ren-dered spires of mine thou un-cracked keel and on-ly god bul-lied hull thou firm deck and haughty helm and Pole point-ed prow â death glo-ri-ous ship must ye then per-ish and without me Am I cut off from the last fond pride of mean-est ship-wrecked cap-tains Oh lone-ly death on lone-ly life Oh now I feel my top-most great-ness lies in my top-most grief Ho ho from all your fur-thest bounds pour ye now in ye bold bil-lows of my whole fore-gone life and top this one piled comber of my death Towards thee I roll thou all de-stroy-ing but un-con-quer-ing whale to the last I grap-ple with thee from hel-lâ s heart I stab at thee for hateâ s sake I spit my last breath at thee Sink all coffins and all hears-es to one com-mon pool and since nei-ther can be mine let me then tow to pieces while still chas-ing thee though tied to thee thou damned whale Thus I give up the spear â The har-poon was dart-ed the strick-en whale flew for-ward with ig-nit-ing ve-loc-i-ty the line ran through the grooves â ran foul Ahab stooped to clear it he did clear it but the fly-ing turn caught him round the neck and voice-less-ly as Turk-ish mutes bow-string their vic-tim he was shot out of the boat ere the crew knew he was gone Next in-stant the heavy eye splice in the ropeâ s fi-nal end flew out of the stark emp-ty tub knocked down an oars-man and smit-ing the sea dis-ap-peared in its depths For an in-stant the tranced boatâ s crew stood still then turned â The ship Great God where is the ship â Soon they through dim bewil-der-ing medi-ums saw her side-long fad-ing phan-tom as in the gaseous Fa-ta Mor-gana on-ly the up-per-most masts out of water while fixed by in-fat-u-a-tion or fideli-ty or fate to their once lofty perch-es the pa-gan har-pooneers still main-tained their sink-ing look-outs on the sea And now con-cen-tric cir-cles seized the lone boat it-self and all its crew and each float-ing oar and every lance pole and spin-ning an-i-mate and inan-i-mate all round and round in one vor-tex car-ried the smallest chip of the Pe-quod out of sight But as the last whelm-ings in-ter-mix-ing-ly poured them-selves over the sunken head of the In-di-an at the main-mast leav-ing a few inch-es of the erect spar yet vis-i-ble to-geth-er with long stream-ing yards of the flag which calm-ly un-du-lat-ed with iron-i-cal coin-cid-ings over the de-stroy-ing bil-lows they al-most touched â at that in-stant a red arm and a ham-mer hovered back-ward-ly uplift-ed in the open air in the act of nail-ing the flag faster and yet faster to the sub-sid-ing spar A sky hawk that taunt-ing-ly had fol-lowed the main truck down-wards from its nat-u-ral home among the stars peck-ing at the flag and in-com-mod-ing Tashtego there this bird now chanced to in-ter-cept its broad flut-ter-ing wing between the ham-mer and the wood and si-mul-ta-ne-ous-ly feel-ing that ethe-ri-al thrill the sub-merged sav-age be-neath in his death gasp kept his ham-mer frozen there and so the bird of heav-en with ar-changel-ic shrieks and his im-pe-ri-al beak thrust up-wards and his whole cap-tive form fold-ed in the flag of Ahab went down with his ship which like Satan would not sink to hell till she had dragged a liv-ing part of heav-en along with her and hel-met-ed her-self with it Now small fowls flew scream-ing over the yet yawn-ing gulf a sullen white surf beat against its steep sides then all col-lapsed and the great shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thou-sand years ago Epi-logue â AND I ONLY AM ESCAPED ALONE TO TELL THEEâ Job The dra-maâ s done Why then here does any one step forth â Be-cause one did sur-vive the wreck It so chanced that after the Parseeâ s dis-ap-pear-ance I was he whom the Fates or-dained to take the place of Ahabâ s bows-man when that bows-man as-sumed

when the half-spent suc-tion of the sunk ship reached me I was then but slow-ly drawn towards the clos-ing vor-tex When I reached it it had sub-sid-ed to a creamy pool Round and round then and ever con-tract-ing towards the but-ton like black bub-ble at the ax-is of that slow-ly wheel-ing cir-cle like another Ix-ion I did re-volve Till gain-ing that vi-tal cen-tre the black bub-ble up-ward burst and now lib-er-at-ed by rea-son of its cun-ning spring and owing to its great buoy-an-cy ris-ing with great force the cof-fin life buoy shot length-wise from the sea fell over and float-ed by my side
