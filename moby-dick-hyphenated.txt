ves-sels Amer-i-can few ev-er re-turn in the ships on board of which they de-part-ed   Cruise in a Whale Boat  Sud-den-ly a mighty mass emerged from the wa-ter and shot up per-pen-dic-u-lar-ly in-to the air It was the whale   Miri-am Coffin or the Whale Fish-er-man  The Whale is har-pooned to be sure but be-think you how you would man-age a pow-er-ful un-bro-ken colt with the mere ap-pli-ance of a rope tied to the root of his tail   A Chap-ter on Whal-ing in Ribs and Trucks  On one oc-ca-sion I saw two of the-se mon-sters whales prob-a-bly male and fe-male slow-ly swim-ming one af-ter the oth-er with-in less than a stone s throw of the shore Ter-ra Del Fue-go  over which the beech tree ex-tend-ed its branch-es   Dar-win s Voy-age of a Nat-u-ral-ist   Stern all  ex-claimed the mate as up-on turn-ing his head he saw the dis-tend-ed jaws of a large Sperm Whale close to the head of the boat threat-en-ing it with in-stant de-struc-tion   Stern all for your lives    Whar-ton the Whale

gi-ant in might where might is right And King of the bound-less sea   Whale Song CHAPTER 1 Loom-ings Call me Ish-mael Some years ago nev-er mind how long pre-cise-ly hav-ing lit-tle or no mon-ey in my purse and noth-ing par-tic-u-lar to in-ter-est me on shore I thought I would sail about a lit-tle and see the wa-tery part of the world It is a way I have of driv-ing off the spleen and reg-u-lat-ing the cir-cu-la-tion When-ev-er I find my-self grow-ing grim about the mouth when-ev-er it is a damp driz-zly Novem-ber in my soul when-ev-er I find my-self in-vol-un-tar-i-ly paus-ing be-fore coffin ware-hous-es and bring-ing up the rear of ev-ery fu-ner-al I meet and es-pe-cial-ly when-ev-er my hy-pos get such an up-per hand of me that it re-quires a strong moral prin-ci-ple to pre-vent me from de-lib-er-ate-ly step-ping in-to the street and me-thod-i-cal-ly knock-ing peo-ple s hats of-f then I ac-count it high time to get to sea as soon as I can This is my sub-sti-tute for pis-tol and ball With a philo-soph-i-cal flour-ish Ca-to throws him-self up-on his sword I qui-et-ly take to the ship There is noth-ing sur-pris-ing in this If they but knew it al-most all men in their de-gree some time or oth-er cher-ish very near-ly the same feel-ings to-wards the ocean with me There now is your in-su-lar city of the Man-hat-toes belt-ed round by wharves as In-di-an isles by coral reef-s com-merce sur-rounds it with her surf Right and left the streets take you wa-ter-ward Its ex-treme down-town is the bat-tery where that no-ble mole is washed by waves and cooled by breezes which a few hours pre-vi-ous were out of sight of land Look at the crowds of wa-ter gaz-ers there Cir-cum-am-bu-late the city of a dreamy Sab-bath af-ter-noon Go from Cor-lears Hook to Coen-ties Slip and from thence by White-hall north-ward What do you see  Post-ed like silent sen-tinels all around the town stand thou-sands up-on thou-sands of mor-tal men fixed in ocean rever-ies Some lean-ing again-st the spiles some seat-ed up-on the pier heads some look-ing over the bul-warks of ships from Chi-na some high aloft in the rig-ging as if striv-ing to get a still bet-ter sea-ward peep But the-se are all lands-men of week days pent up in lath and plas-ter tied to coun-eers nailed to bench-es clinched to desks How then is this Are the green fields gone What do they here But look here come more crowds pac-ing straight for the wa-ter and seem-ing-ly bound for a di-ve Strange Noth-ing will con-tent them but the ex-tremest lim-it of the land loi-ter-ing un-der the shady lee of yon-der ware-hous-es will not suf-fice No They must get just as nigh the wa-ter as they pos-si-bly can with-out falling in And there they stand miles of them leagues In-lan-ders all they come from lanes and al-leys streets and av-enues north east south and west Yet here they all unite Tell me does the mag-net-ic virtue of the needles of the com-pass-es of all those ships at-tract them thith-er Once more Say you are in the coun-try in some high land of lakes Take al-most any path you please and ten to one it car-ries you down in a dale and leaves you there by a pool in the stream There is mag-ic in it Let the most ab-sent mind-ed of men be plunged in his deep-est rever-ies stand that man on his legs set his feet a go-ing and he will in-fal-li-bly lead you to wa-ter if wa-ter there be in all that re-gion Should you ev-er be athirst in the great Amer-i-can de-sert try this ex-per-i-ment if your car-a-van hap-pen to be sup-plied with a meta-phys-i-cal pro-fes-sor Yes as ev-ery one knows med-i-ta-tion and wa-ter are wed-ded for ev-er But here is an artist He de-sires to paint you the dreami-est shadi-est qui-etest most en-chant-ing bit of ro-man-tic land-scape in all the val-ley of the Sa-co What is the chief el-e-ment he em-ploys There stand his trees each with a hol-low trunk as if a her-mit and a cru-ci-fix were with-in and here sleeps his mead-ow and there sleep his cat-tle and up from yon-der cot-tage goes a sleepy smoke Deep in-to dis-tant wood-lands winds a mazy way reach-ing to over-lap-ping spurs of moun-tains bathed in their hill side blue But though the pic-ture lies thus tranced and though this pine tree shakes down its sighs like leaves up-on this shep-herd s head yet all were vain un-less the shep-herd s eye were fixed up-on the mag-ic stream be-fore him Go vis-it the Prairies in June when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee deep among Tiger lilies what is the one charm want-ing  Water there is not a drop of wa-ter there Were Ni-a-gara but a cataract of sand would you trav-el your thou-sand miles to see it Why did the poor poet of Ten-nessee up-on sud-den-ly re-ceiv-ing two hand-fuls of sil-ver de-lib-er-ate whether to buy him a coat which he sad-ly need-ed or in-vest his mon-ey in a pedes-tri-an trip to Rock-away Beach Why is al-most ev-ery ro-bust healthy boy with a ro-bust healthy soul in him at some time or oth-er crazy to go to sea Why up-on your first voy-age as a pas-sen-ger did you your-self feel such a mys-ti-cal vi-bra-tion when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land Why did the old Per-sians hold the sea holy Why did the Greeks give it a sep-a-rate de-ity and own broth-er of Jove Sure-ly all this is not with-out mean-ing And still deep-er the mean-ing of that sto-ry of Nar-cis-sus who be-cause he could not grasp the tor-ment-ing mild im-age he saw in the foun-tain plunged in-to it and was drowned But that same im-age we our-selves see in all rivers and oceans It is the im-age of the un-gras-pable phan-tom of life and this is the key to it all Now when I say that I am in the habit of go-ing to sea when-ev-er I be-gin to grow hazy about the eyes and be-gin to be over con-scious of my lungs I do not mean to have it in-ferred that I ev-er go to sea as a pas-sen-ger For to go as a pas-sen-ger you must needs have a purse and a purse is but a rag un-less you have some-thing in it Be-sides pas-sen-gers get sea sick grow quar-rel-some don t sleep of night-s do not en-joy them-selves much as a gen-er-al thing  no I nev-er go as a pas-sen-ger nor though I am some-thing of a salt do I ev-er go to sea as a Com-modore or a Cap-tain or a Cook I aban-don the glo-ry and dis-tinc-tion of such of-fices to those who like them For my part I abom-i-nate all hon-or-able re-spectable toils tri-als and tribu-la-tions of ev-ery kind what-so-ev-er It is quite as much as I can do to take care of my-self with-out tak-ing care of ships bar-ques brigs schooners and what not And as for go-ing as cook  though I con-fess there is con-sid-er-able glo-ry in that a cook be-ing a sort of of-fi-cer on ship board yet some-how I nev-er fan-cied broil-ing fowls  though on-ce broiled ju-di-cious-ly but-tered and judg-mat-i-cal-ly salt-ed and pep-pered there is no one who will speak more re-spect-ful-ly not to say rev-er-en-tial-ly of a broiled fowl than I will It is out of the idol-a-trous dot-ings of the old Egyp-tians up-on broiled ibis and roast-ed river horse that you see the mum-mies of those crea-tures in their huge bake hous-es the pyra-mids No when I go to sea I go as a sim-ple sailor right be-fore the mast plumb down in-to the fore-castle aloft there to the roy-al mast head True they rather or-der me about some and make me jump from spar to spar like a grasshop-per in a May mead-ow And at first this sort of thing is un-pleas-ant enough It touch-es one s sense of hon-or par-tic-u-lar-ly if you come of an old es-tab-lished fam-i-ly in the land the Van Rens-se-laers or Ran-dolphs or Hardi-canutes And more than all if just pre-vi-ous to putting your hand in-to the tar pot you have been lord-ing it as a coun-try school-mas-ter mak-ing the tallest boys stand in awe of you The tran-si-tion is a keen one I as-sure you from a school-mas-ter to a sailor and re-quires a strong de-coc-tion of Seneca and the Sto-ics to en-able you to grin and bear it But even this wears off in time What of it if some old hunks of a sea cap-tain or-ders me to get a broom and sweep down the decks What does that in-dig-ni-ty amount to weighed I mean in the scales of the New Tes-ta-ment Do you think the archangel Gabriel thinks any-thing the less of me be-cause I prompt-ly and re-spect-ful-ly obey that old hunks in that par-tic-u-lar in-stance Who ain t a slave Tell me that Well then how-ev-er the old sea cap-tains may or-der me about how-ev-er they may thump and punch me about I have the sat-is-fac-tion of know-ing that it is all right that ev-ery-body else is one way or oth-er served in much the same way ei-ther in a phys-i-cal or meta-phys-i-cal point of view that is and so the uni-ver-sal thump is passed round and all hands should rub each oth-er s shoul-der blades and be con-tent Again I al-ways go to sea as a sailor be-cause they make a point of pay-ing me for my trou-ble where-as they nev-er pay pas-sen-gers a sin-gle pen-ny that I ev-er heard of On the con-trary pas-sen-gers them-selves must pay And there is all the dif-fer-ence in the world be-tween pay-ing and be-ing paid The act of pay-ing is per-haps the most un-com-fort-able in-flic-tion that the two or-chard thieves en-tailed up-on us But be-ing paid  what will com-pare with it The ur-bane ac-tiv-i-ty with which a man re-ceives mon-ey is re-al-ly mar-vel-lous con-sid-er-ing that we so earnest-ly be-lieve mon-ey to be the root of all earth-ly il-ls and that on no ac-count can a monied man en-ter heav-en Ah how cheer-ful-ly we con-sign our-selves to perdi-tion Fi-nal-ly I al-ways go to sea as a sailor be-cause of the whole-some ex-er-cise and pure air of the fore castle deck For as in this world head winds are far more preva-lent than winds from astern that is if you nev-er vi-o-late the Pythagore-an max-im so for the most part the Com-modore on the quar-ter deck gets his at-mo-sphere at sec-ond hand from the sailors on the fore-castle He thinks he breathes it first but not so In much the same way do the com-mon-al-ty lead their lead-ers in many oth-er things at the same time that the lead-ers lit-tle sus-pect it But where-fore it was that af-ter hav-ing re-peat-ed-ly smelt the sea as a mer-chant sailor I should now take it in-to my head to go on a whal-ing voy-age this the in-vis-i-ble po-lice of-fi-cer of the Fates who has the con-stant surveil-lance of me and se-cret-ly dogs me and in-flu-ences me in some un-ac-count-able way he can bet-ter an-swer than any one else And doubtless my go-ing on this whal-ing voy-age formed part of the grand pro-gram-me of Prov-i-dence that was drawn up a long time ago It came in as a sort of brief in-ter-lude and solo be-tween more ex-ten-sive per-for-mances I take it that this part of the bill must have run some-thing like this  Grand Con-test-ed Elec-tion for the Pres-i-den-cy of the Unit-ed States  WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL  BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN  Though I can-not tell why it was ex-act-ly that those stage man-agers the Fates put me down for this shab-by part of a whal-ing voy-age when oth-ers were set down for mag-nif-i-cent parts in high tragedies and short and easy parts in gen-teel come-dies and jol-ly parts in farces though I can-not tell why this was ex-act-ly yet now that I re-call all the cir-cum-stances I think I can see a lit-tle in-to the springs and mo-tives which be-ing cun-ning-ly pre-sent-ed to me un-der var-i-ous dis-guis-es in-duced me to set about per-form-ing the part I did be-sides ca-jol-ing me in-to the delu-sion that it was a choice re-sult-ing from my own un-bi-ased freewill and dis-crim-i-nat-ing judg-ment Chief among the-se mo-tives was the over-whelm-ing idea of the great whale him-self Such a por-ten-tous and mys-te-ri-ous mon-ster roused all my cu-rios-i-ty Then the wild and dis-tant seas where he rolled his is-land bulk the un-de-liv-er-able name-less per-ils of the whale the-se with all the at-tend-ing mar-vels of a thou-sand Patag-o-ni-an sights and sounds helped to sway me to my wish With oth-er men per-haps such things would not have been in-duce-men-ts but as for me I am tor-ment-ed with an ev-er-last-ing itch for things re-mote I love to sail for-bid-den seas and land on bar-barous coasts Not ig-nor-ing what is good I am quick to per-ceive a hor-ror and could still be so-cial with it would they let me since it is but well to be on friend-ly ter-ms with all the in-mates of the place one lodges in By rea-son of the-se things then the whal-ing voy-age was wel-come the great flood gates of the won-der world swung open and in the wild con-ceits that swayed me to my pur-pose two and two there float-ed in-to my in-most soul end-less pro-ces-sions of the whale and mid most of them all one grand hood-ed phan-tom like a snow hill in the air CHAPTER 2 The Car-pet Bag I stuffed a shirt or two in-to my old car-pet bag tucked it un-der my arm and start-ed for Cape Horn and the Paci-fic Quit-ting the good city of old Man-hat-to I du-ly ar-rived in New Bed-ford It was a Satur-day night in De-cem-ber Much was I dis-ap-point-ed up-on learn-ing that the lit-tle pack-et for Nan-tuck-et had al-ready sailed and that no way of reach-ing that place would of-fer till the fol-low-ing Mon-day As most young can-di-dates for the pains and penalties of whal-ing stop at this same New Bed-ford thence to em-bark on their voy-age it may as well be re-lat-ed that I for one had no idea of so do-ing For my mind was made up to sail in no oth-er than a Nan-tuck-et craft be-cause there was a fine bois-ter-ous some-thing about ev-ery-thing con-nect-ed with that fa-mous old is-land which amaz-ing-ly pleased me Be-sides though New Bed-ford has of late been grad-u-al-ly mo-nop-o-lis-ing the busi-ness of whal-ing and though in this mat-ter poor old Nan-tuck-et is now much be-hind her yet Nan-tuck-et was her great orig-i-nal the Tyre of this Carthage  the place where the first dead Amer-i-can whale was strand-ed Where else but from Nan-tuck-et did those abo-rig-i-nal whale-men the Red Men first sal-ly out in ca-noes to give chase to the Le-viathan And where but from Nan-tuck-et too did that first ad-ven-tur-ous lit-tle sloop put forth part-ly laden with im-port-ed cob-ble-stones so goes the sto-ry to throw at the whales in or-der to dis-cov-er when they were nigh enough to risk a har-poon from the bowsprit Now hav-ing a night a day and still an-oth-er night fol-low-ing be-fore me in New Bed-ford ere I could em-bark for my des-tined port it be-came a mat-ter of con-cern-ment where I was to eat and sleep mean-while It was a very du-bi-ous look-ing nay a very dark and dis-mal night bit-ing-ly cold and cheer-less I knew no one in the place With anx-ious grap-nels I had sound-ed my pock-et and on-ly brought up a few pieces of sil-ver  So wherever you go Ish-mael said I to my-self as I stood in the mid-dle of a drea-ry street shoul-der-ing my bag and com-par-ing the gloom to-wards the north with the dark-ness to-wards the south wherever in your wis-dom you may con-clude to lodge for the night my dear Ish-mael be sure to in-quire the price and don t be too par-tic-u-lar With halt-ing steps I paced the streets and passed the sign of  The Crossed Har-poon-s  but it looked too ex-pen-sive and jol-ly there Fur-ther on from the bright red win-dows of the  Sword Fish Inn  there came such fer-vent rays that it seemed to have melt-ed the packed snow and ice from be-fore the house for ev-ery-where else the con-gealed frost lay ten inch-es thick in a hard as-phaltic pave-ment  rather weary for me when I struck my foot again-st the flinty pro-jec-tions be-cause from hard re-morse-less ser-vice the soles of my boots were in a most mis-er-able plight Too ex-pen-sive and jol-ly again thought I paus-ing one mo-ment to watch the broad glare in the street and hear the sounds of the tin-kling glass-es with-in But go on Ish-mael said I at last don t you hear get away from be-fore the door your patched boots are stop-ping the way So on I went I now by in-stinct fol-lowed the streets that took me wa-ter-ward for there doubtless were the cheap-est if not the cheeri-est in-ns Such drea-ry streets blocks of black-ness not hous-es on ei-ther hand and here and there a can-dle like a can-dle mov-ing about in a tomb At this hour of the night of the last day of the week that quar-ter of the town proved all but de-sert-ed But present-ly I came to a smoky light pro-ceed-ing from a low wide build-ing the door of which stood invit-ing-ly open It had a care-less look as if it were meant for the us-es of the pub-lic so en-ter-ing the first thing I did was to stum-ble over an ash box in the porch Ha thought I ha as the fly-ing par-ti-cles al-most choked me are the-se ash-es from that de-stroyed city Go-mor-rah But  The Crossed Har-poons  and  The Sword Fish   this then must needs be the sign of  The Trap  How-ev-er I picked my-self up and hear-ing a loud voice with-in pushed on and opened a sec-ond in-te-ri-or door It seemed the great Black Par-lia-ment sit-ting in Tophet A hun-dred black faces turned round in their rows to peer and be-yond a black An-gel of Doom was beat-ing a book in a pul-pit It was a ne-gro church and the preacher s text was about the black-ness of dark-ness and the weep-ing and wail-ing and teeth gnash-ing there Ha Ish-mael mut-tered I back-ing out Wretched en-ter-tain-ment at the sign of  The Trap  Mov-ing on I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks and heard a for-lorn creak-ing in the air and look-ing up saw a swing-ing sign over the door with a white paint-ing up-on it faint-ly rep-re-sent-ing a tall straight jet of misty spray and the-se words un-der-neath  The Spouter Inn  Peter Coffin  Coffin  Spouter  Rather omi-nous in that par-tic-u-lar con-nex-ion thought I But it is a com-mon name in Nan-tuck-et they say and I sup-pose this Peter here is an em-i-grant from there As the light looked so dim and the place for the time looked qui-et enough and the di-lap-i-dat-ed lit-tle wood-en house it-self looked as if it might have been cart-ed here from the ru-ins of some burnt dis-trict and as the swing-ing sign had a pover-ty strick-en sort of creak to it I thought that here was the very spot for cheap lodg-ings and the best of pea cof-fee It was a queer sort of place a gable end-ed old house one side palsied as it were and lean-ing over sad-ly It stood on a sharp bleak cor-ner where that tem-pes-tu-ous wind Euro-clydon kept up a worse howl-ing than ev-er it did about poor Paul s tossed craft Euro-clydon nev-er-the-less is a mighty pleas-ant zephyr to any one in doors with his feet on the hob qui-et-ly toast-ing for bed  In judg-ing of that tem-pes-tu-ous wind called Euro-clydon  says an old writer of whose works I pos-sess the on-ly copy ex-tan-t  it maketh a mar-vel-lous dif-fer-ence whether thou lookest out at it from a glass win-dow where the frost is all on the out-side or whether thou ob-ser-vest it from that sash-less win-dow where the frost is on both sides and of which the wight Death is the on-ly glazier  True enough thought I as this pas-sage oc-curred to my mind old black let-ter thou rea-son-est well Yes the-se eyes are win-dows and this body of mine is the house What a pity they did-n t stop up the chinks and the cran-nies though and thrust in a lit-tle lint here and there But it s too late to make any im-prove-men-ts now The uni-verse is fin-ished the cope-stone is on and the chips were cart-ed off a mil-lion years ago Poor Lazarus there chat-ter-ing his teeth again-st the curb-stone for his pil-low and shak-ing off his tat-ters with his shiv-er-ings he might plug up both ears with rags and put a corn cob in-to his mouth and yet that would not keep out the tem-pes-tu-ous Euro-clydon Euro-clydon says old Dives in his red silken wrap-per he had a red-der one af-ter-wards pooh pooh What a fine frosty night how Ori-on glit-ters what north-ern lights Let them talk of their ori-en-tal sum-mer climes of ev-er-last-ing con-ser-va-to-ries give me the priv-i-lege of mak-ing my own sum-mer with my own coals But what thinks Lazarus Can he warm his blue hands by hold-ing them up to the grand north-ern lights Would not Lazarus rather be in Su-ma-tra than here Would he not far rather lay him down length-wise along the line of the equa-tor yea ye gods go down to the fiery pit it-self in or-der to keep out this frost Now that Lazarus should lie strand-ed there on the curb-stone be-fore the door of Dives this is more won-der-ful than that an ice-berg should be moored to one of the Moluc-cas Yet Dives him-self he too lives like a Czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs and be-ing a pres-i-dent of a tem-per-ance so-ci-ety he on-ly drinks the tepid tears of or-phans But no more of this blub-ber-ing now we are go-ing a whal-ing and there is plen-ty of that yet to come Let us scrape the ice from our frost-ed feet and see what sort of a place this  Spouter may be CHAPTER 3 The Spouter Inn En-ter-ing that gable end-ed Spouter Inn you found your-self in a wide low strag-gling en-try with old fash-ioned wain-scots re-mind-ing one of the bul-warks of some con-demned old craft On one side hung a very large oil-paint-ing so thor-ough-ly be-smoked and ev-ery way de-faced that in the un-equal crosslights by which you viewed it it was on-ly by dili-gent study and a se-ries of sys-tem-at-ic vis-its to it and care-ful in-quiry of the neigh-bors that you could any way ar-rive at an un-der-stand-ing of its pur-pose Such un-ac-count-able mass-es of shades and shad-ows that at first you al-most thought some am-bi-tious young artist in the time of the New Eng-land hags had en-deav-ored to de-lin-eate chaos be-witched But by dint of much and earnest con-tem-pla-tion and oft re-peat-ed pon-der-ings and es-pe-cial-ly by throw-ing open the lit-tle win-dow to-wards the back of the en-try you at last come to the con-clu-sion that such an idea how-ev-er wild might not be al-to-geth-er un-war-rant-ed But what most puz-zled and con-found-ed you was a long lim-ber por-ten-tous black mass of some-thing hov-er-ing in the cen-tre of the pic-ture over three blue dim per-pen-dic-u-lar lines float-ing in a name-less yeast A bog-gy sog-gy squitchy pic-ture tru-ly enough to drive a ner-vous man dis-tract-ed Yet was there a sort of in-def-i-nite half at-tained unimag-in-able sub-lim-i-ty about it that fair-ly froze you to it till you in-vol-un-tar-i-ly took an oath with your-self to find out what that mar-vel-lous paint-ing meant Ever and anon a bright but alas de-cep-tive idea would dart you through  It s the Black Sea in a mid-night gale  It s the un-nat-u-ral com-bat of the four pri-mal el-e-men-ts  It s a blast-ed heath  It s a Hyper-bore-an win-ter scene  It s the break-ing up of the ice-bound stream of Time But at last all the-se fan-cies yield-ed to that one por-ten-tous some-thing in the pic-ture s mid-st That on-ce found out and all the rest were plain But stop does it not bear a faint re-sem-blance to a gi-gan-tic fish even the great leviathan him-self In fact the artist s de-sign seemed this a fi-nal the-o-ry of my own part-ly based up-on the ag-gre-gat-ed opin-ions of many aged per-sons with whom I con-versed up-on the sub-ject The pic-ture rep-re-sen-ts a Cape Horner in a great hur-ri-cane the half foundered ship wel-ter-ing there with its three dis-man-tled mas-ts alone vis-i-ble and an ex-as-per-at-ed whale pur-pos-ing to spring clean over the craft is in the enor-mous act of im-pal-ing him-self up-on the three mast heads The op-po-site wall of this en-try was hung all over with a hea-then-ish ar-ray of mon-strous clubs and spears Some were thick-ly set with glit-ter-ing teeth re-sem-bling ivory saws oth-ers were tuft-ed with knots of hu-man hair and one was sick-le shaped with a vast han-dle sweep-ing round like the seg-ment made in the new mown grass by a long armed mow-er You shud-dered as you gazed and won-dered what mon-strous can-ni-bal and sav-age could ev-er have gone a death har-vest-ing with such a hack-ing hor-ri-fy-ing im-ple-ment Mixed with the-se were rusty old whal-ing lances and har-poons all bro-ken and de-formed Some were sto-ried weapons With this on-ce long lance now wild-ly el-bowed fifty years ago did Nathan Swain kill fif-teen whales be-tween a sun-rise and a sun-set And that har-poon so like a corkscrew now was flung in Ja-van seas and run away with by a whale years af-ter-wards slain off the Cape of Blan-co The orig-i-nal iron en-tered nigh the tail and like a rest-less needle so-journ-ing in the body of a man trav-elled full forty feet and at last was found imbed-ded in the hump Cross-ing this dusky en-try and on through yon low arched way cut through what in old times must have been a great cen-tral chim-ney with fire-places all round you en-ter the pub-lic room A still duskier place is this with such low pon-der-ous beams above and such old wrin-kled planks be-neath that you would al-most fan-cy you trod some old craft s cock-pits es-pe-cial-ly of such a howl-ing night when this cor-ner an-chored old ark rocked so fu-ri-ous-ly On one side stood a long low shelf like table cov-ered with cracked glass cas-es filled with dusty rar-i-ties gath-ered from this wide world s re-motest nooks Pro-ject-ing from the fur-ther an-gle of the room stands a dark look-ing den the bar a rude at-tempt at a right whale s head Be that how it may there stands the vast arched bone of the whale s jaw so wide a coach might al-most drive be-neath it Within are shab-by shelves ranged round with old de-canters bot-tles flasks and in those jaws of swift de-struc-tion like an-oth-er cursed Jon-ah by which name in-deed they called him bustles a lit-tle with-ered old man who for their mon-ey dear-ly sel-ls the sailors delir-i-ums and death Abom-inable are the tum-blers in-to which he pours his poi-son Though true cylin-ders with-out with-in the vil-lanous green gog-gling glass-es de-ceit-ful-ly ta-pered down-wards to a cheat-ing bot-tom Par-al-lel merid-i-ans rude-ly pecked in-to the glass sur-round the-se foot-pad-s gob-lets Fill to this mark and your charge is but a pen-ny to this a pen-ny more and so on to the full glass the Cape Horn mea-sure which you may gulp down for a shilling Upon en-ter-ing the place I found a num-ber of young sea-men gath-ered about a table ex-am-in-ing by a dim light di-vers spec-i-mens of skrimshan-der I sought the land-lord and telling him I de-sired to be ac-com-mo-dat-ed with a room re-ceived for an-swer that his house was ful-l not a bed un-oc-cu-pied  But avast  he added tap-ping his fore-head  you haint no ob-jec-tions to shar-ing a har-pooneer s blan-ket have ye I s pose you are goin a whal-in so you d bet-ter get used to that sort of thing  I told him that I nev-er liked to sleep two in a bed that if I should ev-er do so it would de-pend up-on who the har-pooneer might be and that if he the land-lord re-al-ly had no oth-er place for me and the har-pooneer was not de-cid-ed-ly ob-jec-tion-able why rather than wan-der fur-ther about a strange town on so bit-ter a night I would put up with the half of any de-cent man s blan-ket  I thought so All right take a seat Sup-per  you want sup-per Sup-per ll be ready di-rect-ly  I sat down on an old wood-en set-tle carved all over like a bench on the Bat-tery At one end a ru-mi-nat-ing tar was still fur-ther adorn-ing it with his jack knife stoop-ing over and dili-gent-ly work-ing away at the space be-tween his legs He was try-ing his hand at a ship un-der full sail but he did-n t make much head-way I thought At last some four or five of us were sum-moned to our meal in an ad-join-ing room It was cold as Ice-land no fire at al-l the land-lord said he could-n t af-ford it Noth-ing but two dis-mal tal-low can-dles each in a wind-ing sheet We were fain to but-ton up our mon-key jack-ets and hold to our lips cups of scald-ing tea with our half frozen fin-gers But the fare was of the most sub-stan-tial kind not on-ly meat and pota-toes but dumplings good heav-ens dumplings for sup-per One young fel-low in a green box coat ad-dressed him-self to the-se dumplings in a most dire-ful man-ner  My boy  said the land-lord  you ll have the night-mare to a dead sar-tain-ty   Land-lord  I whis-pered  that aint the har-pooneer is it   Oh no  said he look-ing a sort of di-a-bol-i-cal-ly fun-ny  the har-pooneer is a dark com-plex-ioned chap He nev-er eats dumplings he don t he eats noth-ing but steaks and he likes  em rare   The dev-il he does  says I  Where is that har-pooneer Is he here   He ll be here afore long  was the an-swer I could not help it but I be-gan to feel sus-pi-cious of this  dark com-plex-ioned har-pooneer At any rate I made up my mind that if it so turned out that we should sleep to-geth-er he must un-dress and get in-to bed be-fore I did Sup-per over the com-pa-ny went back to the bar room when know-ing not what else to do with my-self I re-solved to spend the rest of the evening as a look-er on Present-ly a ri-ot-ing noise was heard with-out Start-ing up the land-lord cried  That s the Gram-pus s crew I seed her re-port-ed in the off-ing this morn-ing a three years voy-age and a full ship Hur-rah boys now we ll have the lat-est news from the Feegees  A tramp-ing of sea boots was heard in the en-try the door was flung open and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough En-veloped in their shag-gy watch coats and with their heads muf-fled in wool-len com-forters all be-darned and ragged and their beards stiff with ici-cles they seemed an erup-tion of bears from Labrador They had just land-ed from their boat and this was the first house they en-tered No won-der then that they made a straight wake for the whale s mouth the bar when the wrin-kled lit-tle old Jon-ah there of-fi-ci-at-ing soon poured them out brim-mers all round One com-plained of a bad cold in his head up-on which Jon-ah mixed him a pitch like po-tion of gin and mo-lasses which he swore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catar-rhs what-so-ev-er nev-er mind of how long stand-ing or whether caught off the coast of Labrador or on the weath-er side of an ice is-land The liquor soon mount-ed in-to their heads as it gen-er-al-ly does even with the ar-ran-test top-ers new-ly land-ed from sea and they be-gan ca-per-ing about most ob-streper-ous-ly I ob-served how-ev-er that one of them held some-what aloof and though he seemed de-sirous not to spoil the hi-lar-i-ty of his ship-mates by his own sober face yet up-on the whole he re-frained from mak-ing as much noise as the rest This man in-ter-est-ed me at on-ce and since the sea gods had or-dained that he should soon be-come my ship-mate though but a sleep-ing part-ner one so far as this nar-ra-tive is con-cerned I will here ven-ture up-on a lit-tle de-scrip-tion of him He stood full six feet in height with no-ble shoul-ders and a chest like a cof-fer dam I have sel-dom seen such brawn in a man His face was deeply brown and burnt mak-ing his white teeth daz-zling by the con-trast while in the deep shad-ows of his eyes float-ed some rem-i-nis-cences that did not seem to give him much joy His voice at on-ce an-nounced that he was a South-ern-er and from his fine stature I thought he must be one of those tall moun-taineers from the Al-legha-ni-an Ridge in Vir-ginia When the rev-el-ry of his com-pan-ions had mount-ed to its height this man slipped away un-ob-served and I saw no more of him till he be-came my com-rade on the sea In a few min-utes how-ev-er he was missed by his ship-mates and be-ing it seems for some rea-son a huge favourite with them they raised a cry of  Bulk-ing-ton Bulk-ing-ton where s Bulk-ing-ton  and dart-ed out of the house in pur-suit of him It was now about nine o clock and the room seem-ing al-most su-per-nat-u-ral-ly qui-et af-ter the-se orgies I be-gan to con-grat-u-late my-self up-on a lit-tle plan that had oc-curred to me just pre-vi-ous to the en-trance of the sea-men No man prefers to sleep two in a bed In fact you would a good deal rather not sleep with your own broth-er I don t know how it is but peo-ple like to be pri-vate when they are sleep-ing And when it comes to sleep-ing with an un-known stranger in a strange inn in a strange town and that stranger a har-pooneer then your ob-jec-tions in-def-i-nite-ly mul-ti-ply Nor was there any earth-ly rea-son why I as a sailor should sleep two in a bed more than any-body else for sailors no more sleep two in a bed at sea than bach-e-lor Kings do ashore To be sure they all sleep to-geth-er in one apart-ment but you have your own ham-mock and cov-er your-self with your own blan-ket and sleep in your own skin The more I pon-dered over this har-pooneer the more I abom-i-nat-ed the thought of sleep-ing with him It was fair to pre-sume that be-ing a har-pooneer his linen or wool-len as the case might be would not be of the ti-di-est cer-tain-ly none of the finest I be-gan to twitch all over Be-sides it was get-ting late and my de-cent har-pooneer ought to be home and go-ing bed-wards Sup-pose now he should tum-ble in up-on me at mid-night how could I tell from what vile hole he had been com-ing  Land-lord I ve changed my mind about that har-pooneer  I shan t sleep with him I ll try the bench here   Just as you please I m sor-ry I can t spare ye a table-cloth for a mat-tress and it s a plaguy rough board here  feel-ing of the knots and notch-es  But wait a bit Skrimshan-der I ve got a car-pen-ter s plane there in the bar wait I say and I ll make ye snug enough  So say-ing he pro-cured the plane and with his old silk hand-ker-chief first dust-ing the bench vig-or-ous-ly set to plan-ing away at my bed the while grin-ning like an ape The shav-ings flew right and left till at last the plane iron came bump again-st an in-de-struc-tible knot The land-lord was near sprain-ing his wrist and I told him for heav-en s sake to quit the bed was soft enough to suit me and I did not know how all the plan-ing in the world could make ei-der down of a pine plank So gath-er-ing up the shav-ings with an-oth-er grin and throw-ing them in-to the great stove in the mid-dle of the room he went about his busi-ness and left me in a brown study I now took the mea-sure of the bench and found that it was a foot too short but that could be mend-ed with a chair But it was a foot too nar-row and the oth-er bench in the room was about four inch-es high-er than the planed one so there was no yok-ing them I then placed the first bench length-wise along the on-ly clear space again-st the wall leav-ing a lit-tle in-ter-val be-tween for my back to set-tle down in But I soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from un-der the sill of the win-dow that this plan would nev-er do at all es-pe-cial-ly as an-oth-er cur-rent from the rick-ety door met the one from the win-dow and both to-geth-er formed a se-ries of small whirl-winds in the im-me-di-ate vicin-i-ty of the spot where I had thought to spend the night The dev-il fetch that har-pooneer thought I but stop could-n t I steal a march on him bolt his door in-side and jump in-to his bed not to be wak-ened by the most vi-o-lent knock-ings It seemed no bad idea but up-on sec-ond thoughts I dis-missed it For who could tell but what the next morn-ing so soon as I popped out of the room the har-pooneer might be stand-ing in the en-try all ready to knock me down Still look-ing round me again and see-ing no pos-si-ble chance of spend-ing a suf-fer-able night un-less in some oth-er per-son s bed I be-gan to think that af-ter all I might be cher-ish-ing un-war-rantable prej-u-dices again-st this un-known har-pooneer Thinks I I ll wait awhile he must be drop-ping in be-fore long I ll have a good look at him then and per-haps we may be-come jol-ly good bed-fel-lows af-ter al-l there s no telling But though the oth-er board-ers kept com-ing in by ones twos and threes and go-ing to bed yet no sign of my har-pooneer  Land-lord  said I  what sort of a chap is he does he al-ways keep such late hours  It was now hard up-on twelve o clock The land-lord chuck-led again with his lean chuck-le and seemed to be might-i-ly tick-led at some-thing be-yond my com-pre-hen-sion  No  he an-swered  gen-er-al-ly he s an ear-ly bird air-ley to bed and air-ley to rise yes he s the bird what catch-es the worm But to night he went out a ped-dling you see and I don t see what on airth keeps him so late un-less may be he can t sell his head   Can t sell his head  What sort of a bam-booz-ing-ly sto-ry is this you are telling me  get-ting in-to a tow-er-ing rage  Do you pre-tend to say land-lord that this har-pooneer is ac-tu-al-ly en-gaged this blessed Satur-day night or rather Sun-day morn-ing in ped-dling his head around this town   That s pre-cise-ly it  said the land-lord  and I told him he could-n t sell it here the mar-ket s over-stocked   With what  shout-ed I  With heads to be sure ain t there too many heads in the world   I tell you what it is land-lord  said I quite calm-ly  you d bet-ter stop spin-ning that yarn to me I m not green   May be not  tak-ing out a stick and whit-tling a tooth-pick  but I rayther guess you ll be done brown if that ere har-pooneer hears you a slan-der-in his head   I ll break it for him  said I now fly-ing in-to a pas-sion again at this un-ac-count-able far-rago of the land-lord s  It s broke a ready  said he  Broke  said I  broke do you mean   Sar-tain and that s the very rea-son he can t sell it I guess   Land-lord  said I go-ing up to him as cool as Mt He-cla in a snow stor-m  land-lord stop whit-tling You and I must un-der-stand one an-oth-er and that too with-out de-lay I come to your house and want a bed you tell me you can on-ly give me half a one that the oth-er half be-longs to a cer-tain har-pooneer And about this har-pooneer whom I have not yet seen you per-sist in telling me the most mys-ti-fy-ing and ex-as-per-at-ing sto-ries tend-ing to beget in me an un-com-fort-able feel-ing to-wards the man whom you de-sign for my bed-fel-low a sort of con-nex-ion land-lord which is an in-ti-mate and con-fi-den-tial one in the high-est de-gree I now de-mand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this har-pooneer is and whether I shall be in all re-spec-ts safe to spend the night with him And in the first place you will be so good as to un-say that sto-ry about sell-ing his head which if true I take to be good ev-i-dence that this har-pooneer is stark mad and I ve no idea of sleep-ing with a mad-man and you sir you I mean land-lord you sir by try-ing to in-duce me to do so know-ing-ly would there-by ren-der your-self li-able to a crim-i-nal pros-e-cu-tion   Wall  said the land-lord fetch-ing a long breath  that s a pur-ty long sar-mon for a chap that rips a lit-tle now and then But be easy be easy this here har-pooneer I have been tellin you of has just ar-rived from the south seas where he bought up a lot of  balmed New Zealand heads great cu-rios you know and he s sold all on  em but one and that one he s try-ing to sell to night cause to mor-row s Sun-day and it would not do to be sell-in hu-man heads about the streets when folks is goin to church-es He want-ed to last Sun-day but I stopped him just as he was goin out of the door with four heads strung on a string for all the airth like a string of in-ions  This ac-count cleared up the oth-er-wise un-ac-count-able mys-tery and showed that the land-lord af-ter all had had no idea of fool-ing me but at the same time what could I think of a har-pooneer who stayed out of a Satur-day night clean in-to the holy Sab-bath en-gaged in such a can-ni-bal busi-ness as sell-ing the heads of dead idol-a-tors  Depend up-on it land-lord that har-pooneer is a dan-ger-ous man   He pays reg lar  was the re-join-der  But come it s get-ting dread-ful late you had bet-ter be turn-ing flukes it s a nice bed Sal and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced There s plen-ty of room for two to kick about in that bed it s an almighty big bed that Why afore we give it up Sal used to put our Sam and lit-tle John-ny in the foot of it But I got a dream-ing and sprawl-ing about one night and some-how Sam got pitched on the floor and came near break-ing his arm Arter that Sal said it would-n t do Come along here I ll give ye a glim in a jiffy  and so say-ing he light-ed a can-dle and held it to-wards me of-fer-ing to lead the way But I stood ir-res-o-lute when look-ing at a clock in the cor-ner he ex-claimed  I vum it s Sun-day you won t see that har-pooneer to night he s come to an-chor some-where come along then do come won t ye come  I con-sid-ered the mat-ter a mo-ment and then up stairs we went and I was ush-ered in-to a small room cold as a clam and fur-nished sure enough with a prodi-gious bed al-most big enough in-deed for any four har-pooneers to sleep abreast  There  said the land-lord plac-ing the can-dle on a crazy old sea chest that did dou-ble du-ty as a wash stand and cen-tre table  there make your-self com-fort-able now and good night to ye  I turned round from eye-ing the bed but he had dis-ap-peared Fold-ing back the coun-ter-pane I stooped over the bed Though none of the most el-e-gant it yet stood the scruti-ny tol-er-a-bly well I then glanced round the room and be-sides the bed-stead and cen-tre table could see no oth-er fur-ni-ture be-long-ing to the place but a rude shelf the four wal-ls and a pa-pered fire-board rep-re-sent-ing a man strik-ing a whale Of things not prop-er-ly be-long-ing to the room there was a ham-mock lashed up and thrown up-on the floor in one cor-ner al-so a large sea-man s bag con-tain-ing the har-pooneer s wardrobe no doubt in lieu of a land trunk Like-wise there was a parcel of out-landish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the fire place and a tall har-poon stand-ing at the head of the bed But what is this on the chest I took it up and held it close to the light and felt it and smelt it and tried ev-ery way pos-si-ble to ar-rive at some sat-is-fac-to-ry con-clu-sion con-cern-ing it I can com-pare it to noth-ing but a large door mat or-na-ment-ed at the edges with lit-tle tin-kling tags some-thing like the stained por-cu-pine quil-ls round an In-di-an moc-cas-in There was a hole or slit in the mid-dle of this mat as you see the same in South Amer-i-can pon-chos But could it be pos-si-ble that any sober har-pooneer would get in-to a door mat and pa-rade the streets of any Chris-tian town in that sort of guise I put it on to try it and it weighed me down like a ham-per be-ing un-com-mon-ly shag-gy and thick and I thought a lit-tle damp as though this mys-te-ri-ous har-pooneer had been wear-ing it of a rainy day I went up in it to a bit of glass stuck again-st the wall and I nev-er saw such a sight in my life I tore my-self out of it in such a hur-ry that I gave my-self a kink in the neck I sat down on the side of the bed and com-menced think-ing about this head ped-dling har-pooneer and his door mat After think-ing some time on the bed side I got up and took off my mon-key jack-et and then stood in the mid-dle of the room think-ing I then took off my coat and thought a lit-tle more in my shirt sleeves But be-gin-ning to feel very cold now half un-dressed as I was and re-mem-ber-ing what the land-lord said about the har-pooneer s not com-ing home at all that night it be-ing so very late I made no more ado but jumped out of my pan-taloons and boots and then blow-ing out the light tum-bled in-to bed and com-mend-ed my-self to the care of heav-en Whether that mat-tress was stuffed with corn cobs or bro-ken crock-ery there is no telling but I rolled about a good deal and could not sleep for a long time At last I slid off in-to a light doze and had pret-ty near-ly made a good off-ing to-wards the land of Nod when I heard a heavy foot-fall in the pas-sage and saw a glim-mer of light come in-to the room from un-der the door Lord save me thinks I that must be the har-pooneer the in-fer-nal head ped-dler But I lay per-fect-ly still and re-solved not to say a word till spo-ken to Hold-ing a light in one hand and that iden-ti-cal New Zealand head in the oth-er the stranger en-tered the room and with-out look-ing to-wards the bed placed his can-dle a good way off from me on the floor in one cor-ner and then be-gan work-ing away at the knot-ted cords of the large bag I be-fore spoke of as be-ing in the room I was all ea-ger-ness to see his face but he kept it avert-ed for some time while em-ployed in un-lac-ing the bag s mouth This ac-com-plished how-ev-er he turned round when good heav-ens what a sight Such a face It was of a dark pur-plish yel-low colour here and there stuck over with large black-ish look-ing squares Yes it s just as I thought he s a ter-ri-ble bed-fel-low he s been in a fight got dread-ful-ly cut and here he is just from the sur-geon But at that mo-ment he chanced to turn his face so to-wards the light that I plain-ly saw they could not be stick-ing plas-ters at all those black squares on his cheeks They were stains of some sort or oth-er At first I knew not what to make of this but soon an inkling of the truth oc-curred to me I re-mem-bered a sto-ry of a white man a whale-man too who falling among the can-ni-bals had been tat-tooed by them I con-clud-ed that this har-pooneer in the course of his dis-tant voy-ages must have met with a sim-i-lar ad-ven-ture And what is it thought I af-ter all It s on-ly his out-side a man can be hon-est in any sort of skin But then what to make of his un-earth-ly com-plex-ion that part of it I mean ly-ing round about and com-plete-ly in-de-pen-dent of the squares of tat-too-ing To be sure it might be noth-ing but a good coat of trop-i-cal tan-ning but I nev-er heard of a hot sun s tan-ning a white man in-to a pur-plish yel-low one How-ev-er I had nev-er been in the South Seas and per-haps the sun there pro-duced the-se ex-traor-di-nary ef-fec-ts up-on the skin Now while all the-se ideas were pass-ing through me like light-ning this har-pooneer nev-er no-ticed me at all But af-ter some dif-fi-cul-ty hav-ing opened his bag he com-menced fum-bling in it and present-ly pulled out a sort of tom-a-hawk and a seal skin wal-let with the hair on Plac-ing the-se on the old chest in the mid-dle of the room he then took the New Zealand head a ghast-ly thing enough and crammed it down in-to the bag He now took off his hat a new beaver hat when I came nigh singing out with fresh sur-prise There was no hair on his head none to speak of at least noth-ing but a small scalp knot twist-ed up on his fore-head His bald pur-plish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull Had not the stranger stood be-tween me and the door I would have bolt-ed out of it quick-er than ev-er I bolt-ed a din-ner Even as it was I thought some-thing of slip-ping out of the win-dow but it was the sec-ond floor back I am no cow-ard but what to make of this head ped-dling pur-ple ras-cal al-to-geth-er passed my com-pre-hen-sion Ig-no-rance is the par-ent of fear and be-ing com-plete-ly non-plussed and con-found-ed about the stranger I con-fess I was now as much afraid of him as if it was the dev-il him-self who had thus bro-ken in-to my room at the dead of night In fact I was so afraid of him that I was not game enough just then to ad-dress him and de-mand a sat-is-fac-to-ry an-swer con-cern-ing what seemed in-ex-pli-ca-ble in him Mean-while he con-tin-ued the busi-ness of un-dress-ing and at last showed his chest and ar-ms As I live the-se cov-ered parts of him were check-ered with the same squares as his face his back too was all over the same dark squares he seemed to have been in a Thir-ty Years War and just es-caped from it with a stick-ing plas-ter shirt Still more his very legs were marked as if a parcel of dark green frogs were run-ning up the trunks of young palms It was now quite plain that he must be some abom-inable sav-age or oth-er shipped aboard of a whale-man in the South Seas and so land-ed in this Chris-tian coun-try I quaked to think of it A ped-dler of heads too per-haps the heads of his own broth-ers He might take a fan-cy to mine heav-ens look at that tom-a-hawk But there was no time for shud-der-ing for now the sav-age went about some-thing that com-plete-ly fas-ci-nat-ed my at-ten-tion and con-vinced me that he must in-deed be a hea-then Go-ing to his heavy gre-go or wrapall or dread-naught which he had pre-vi-ous-ly hung on a chair he fum-bled in the pock-ets and pro-duced at length a cu-ri-ous lit-tle de-formed im-age with a hunch on its back and ex-act-ly the colour of a three days old Con-go baby Re-mem-ber-ing the em-balmed head at first I al-most thought that this black manikin was a re-al baby pre-served in some sim-i-lar man-ner But see-ing that it was not at all lim-ber and that it glis-tened a good deal like pol-ished ebony I con-clud-ed that it must be noth-ing but a wood-en idol which in-deed it proved to be For now the sav-age goes up to the emp-ty fire place and re-mov-ing the pa-pered fire board sets up this lit-tle hunch backed im-age like a ten-pin be-tween the andirons The chim-ney jam-bs and all the bricks in-side were very sooty so that I thought this fire place made a very ap-pro-pri-ate lit-tle shrine or chapel for his Con-go idol I now screwed my eyes hard to-wards the half hid-den im-age feel-ing but ill at ease mean-time to see what was next to fol-low First he takes about a dou-ble hand-ful of shav-ings out of his gre-go pock-et and places them care-ful-ly be-fore the idol then lay-ing a bit of ship bis-cuit on top and ap-ply-ing the flame from the lamp he kin-dled the shav-ings in-to a sac-ri-fi-cial blaze Present-ly af-ter many hasty snatch-es in-to the fire and still hastier with-drawals of his fin-gers where-by he seemed to be scorch-ing them bad-ly he at last suc-ceed-ed in draw-ing out the bis-cuit then blow-ing off the heat and ash-es a lit-tle he made a po-lite of-fer of it to the lit-tle ne-gro But the lit-tle dev-il did not seem to fan-cy such dry sort of fare at all he nev-er moved his lips All the-se strange an-tics were ac-com-pa-nied by still stranger gut-tural nois-es from the devo-tee who seemed to be pray-ing in a sing song or else singing some pa-gan psalmody or oth-er dur-ing which his face twitched about in the most un-nat-u-ral man-ner At last ex-tin-guish-ing the fire he took the idol up very un-cer-e-mo-ni-ous-ly and bagged it again in his gre-go pock-et as care-less-ly as if he were a sports-man bag-ging a dead wood-cock All the-se queer pro-ceed-ings in-creased my un-com-fort-able-ness and see-ing him now ex-hibit-ing strong symp-toms of con-clud-ing his busi-ness op-er-a-tions and jump-ing in-to bed with me I thought it was high time now or nev-er be-fore the light was put out to break the spell in which I had so long been bound But the in-ter-val I spent in de-lib-er-at-ing what to say was a fa-tal one Tak-ing up his tom-a-hawk from the table he ex-am-ined the head of it for an in-stant and then hold-ing it to the light with his mouth at the han-dle he puffed out great clouds of to-bac-co smoke The next mo-ment the light was ex-tin-guished and this wild can-ni-bal tom-a-hawk be-tween his teeth sprang in-to bed with me I sang out I could not help it now and giv-ing a sud-den grunt of as-ton-ish-ment he be-gan feel-ing me Stam-mer-ing out some-thing I knew not what I rolled away from him again-st the wall and then con-jured him who-ev-er or what-ev-er he might be to keep qui-et and let me get up and light the lamp again But his gut-tural re-spons-es sat-is-fied me at on-ce that he but ill com-pre-hend-ed my mean-ing  Who e de-bel you   he at last said  you no speak e dam me I kill e  And so say-ing the light-ed tom-a-hawk be-gan flour-ish-ing about me in the dark  Land-lord for God s sake Peter Coffin  shout-ed I  Land-lord Watch Coffin An-gels save me   Speak e tell ee me who ee be or dam me I kill e  again growled the can-ni-bal while his hor-rid flour-ish-ings of the tom-a-hawk scat-tered the hot to-bac-co ash-es about me till I thought my linen would get on fire But thank heav-en at that mo-ment the land-lord came in-to the room light in hand and leap-ing from the bed I ran up to him  Don t be afraid now  said he grin-ning again  Quee-queg here would-n t harm a hair of your head   Stop your grin-ning  shout-ed I  and why did-n t you tell me that that in-fer-nal har-pooneer was a can-ni-bal   I thought ye know d it  did-n t I tell ye he was a ped-dlin heads around town  but turn flukes again and go to sleep Quee-queg look here you sabbee me I sabbee you this man sleepe you you sabbee   Me sabbee plen-ty  grunt-ed Quee-queg puff-ing away at his pipe and sit-ting up in bed  You get-tee in  he added mo-tion-ing to me with his tom-a-hawk and throw-ing the clothes to one side He re-al-ly did this in not on-ly a civil but a re-al-ly kind and char-i-ta-ble way I stood look-ing at him a mo-ment For all his tat-too-ings he was on the whole a clean come-ly look-ing can-ni-bal What s all this fuss I have been mak-ing about thought I to my-self the man s a hu-man be-ing just as I am he has just as much rea-son to fear me as I have to be afraid of him Bet-ter sleep with a sober can-ni-bal than a drunk-en Chris-tian  Land-lord  said I  tell him to stash his tom-a-hawk there or pipe or what-ev-er you call it tell him to stop smok-ing in short and I will turn in with him But I don t fan-cy hav-ing a man smok-ing in bed with me It s dan-ger-ous Be-sides I ain t in-sured  This be-ing told to Quee-queg he at on-ce com-plied and again po-lite-ly mo-tioned me to get in-to bed rolling over to one side as much as to say  I won t touch a leg of ye   Good night land-lord  said I  you may go  I turned in and nev-er slept bet-ter in my life CHAPTER 4 The Coun-ter-pane Upon wak-ing next morn-ing about day-light I found Quee-queg s arm thrown over me in the most lov-ing and af-fec-tion-ate man-ner You had al-most thought I had been his wife The coun-ter-pane was of patch-work full of odd lit-tle par-ti coloured squares and tri-an-gles and this arm of his tat-tooed all over with an in-ter-minable Cre-tan labyrinth of a fig-ure no two parts of which were of one pre-cise shade ow-ing I sup-pose to his keep-ing his arm at sea un-me-thod-i-cal-ly in sun and shade his shirt sleeves ir-reg-u-lar-ly rolled up at var-i-ous times this same arm of his I say looked for all the world like a strip of that same patch-work quilt In-deed part-ly ly-ing on it as the arm did when I first awoke I could hard-ly tell it from the quilt they so blend-ed their hues to-geth-er and it was on-ly by the sense of weight and pres-sure that I could tell that Quee-queg was hug-ging me My sen-sa-tions were strange Let me try to ex-plain them When I was a child I well re-mem-ber a some-what sim-i-lar cir-cum-stance that be-fell me whether it was a re-al-i-ty or a dream I nev-er could en-tire-ly set-tle The cir-cum-stance was this I had been cut-ting up some ca-per or oth-er I think it was try-ing to crawl up the chim-ney as I had seen a lit-tle sweep do a few days pre-vi-ous and my step-moth-er who some-how or oth-er was all the time whip-ping me or send-ing me to bed sup-per-less  my moth-er dragged me by the legs out of the chim-ney and packed me off to bed though it was on-ly two o clock in the af-ter-noon of the 21st June the longest day in the year in our hemi-sphere I felt dread-ful-ly But there was no help for it so up stairs I went to my lit-tle room in the third floor un-dressed my-self as slow-ly as pos-si-ble so as to kill time and with a bit-ter sigh got be-tween the sheets I lay there dis-mal-ly cal-cu-lat-ing that six-teen en-tire hours must elapse be-fore I could hope for a res-ur-rec-tion Six-teen hours in bed the small of my back ached to think of it And it was so light too the sun shin-ing in at the win-dow and a great rat-tling of coach-es in the streets and the sound of gay voic-es all over the house I felt worse and worse at last I got up dressed and soft-ly go-ing down in my stockinged feet sought out my step-moth-er and sud-den-ly threw my-self at her feet be-seech-ing her as a par-tic-u-lar favour to give me a good slip-per-ing for my mis-be-haviour any-thing in-deed but con-demn-ing me to lie abed such an un-en-durable length of time But she was the best and most con-sci-en-tious of step-moth-ers and back I had to go to my room For sev-er-al hours I lay there broad awake feel-ing a great deal worse than I have ev-er done since even from the great-est sub-se-quent mis-for-tunes At last I must have fal-l-en in-to a trou-bled night-mare of a doze and slow-ly wak-ing from it half steeped in dream-s I opened my eyes and the be-fore sun lit room was now wrapped in out-er dark-ness In-stant-ly I felt a shock run-ning through all my frame noth-ing was to be seen and noth-ing was to be heard but a su-per-nat-u-ral hand seemed placed in mine My arm hung over the coun-ter-pane and the name-less unimag-in-able silent form or phan-tom to which the hand be-longed seemed close-ly seat-ed by my bed side For what seemed ages piled on ages I lay there frozen with the most aw-ful fears not dar-ing to drag away my hand yet ev-er think-ing that if I could but stir it one sin-gle inch the hor-rid spell would be bro-ken I knew not how this con-scious-ness at last glid-ed away from me but wak-ing in the morn-ing I shud-der-ing-ly re-mem-bered it all and for days and weeks and months af-ter-wards I lost my-self in con-found-ing at-temp-ts to ex-plain the mys-tery Nay to this very hour I of-ten puz-zle my-self with it Now take away the aw-ful fear and my sen-sa-tions at feel-ing the su-per-nat-u-ral hand in mine were very sim-i-lar in their strangeness to those which I ex-pe-ri-enced on wak-ing up and see-ing Quee-queg s pa-gan arm thrown round me But at length all the past night s even-ts sober-ly re-curred one by one in fixed re-al-i-ty and then I lay on-ly alive to the com-i-cal predica-ment For though I tried to move his ar-m un-lock his bride-groom clasp yet sleep-ing as he was he still hugged me tight-ly as though naught but death should part us twain I now stro-ve to rouse him  Quee-queg   but his on-ly an-swer was a snore I then rolled over my neck feel-ing as if it were in a horse col-lar and sud-den-ly felt a slight scratch Throw-ing aside the coun-ter-pane there lay the tom-a-hawk sleep-ing by the sav-age s side as if it were a hatch-et faced baby A pret-ty pick-le tru-ly thought I abed here in a strange house in the broad day with a can-ni-bal and a tom-a-hawk  Quee-queg  in the name of good-ness Quee-queg wake  At length by dint of much wrig-gling and loud and in-ces-sant ex-pos-tu-la-tions up-on the un-be-com-ing-ness of his hug-ging a fel-low male in that mat-ri-mo-ni-al sort of style I suc-ceed-ed in ex-tract-ing a grunt and present-ly he drew back his arm shook him-self all over like a New-found-land dog just from the wa-ter and sat up in bed stiff as a pike staff look-ing at me and rub-bing his eyes as if he did not al-to-geth-er re-mem-ber how I came to be there though a dim con-scious-ness of know-ing some-thing about me seemed slow-ly dawn-ing over him Mean-while I lay qui-et-ly eye-ing him hav-ing no se-ri-ous mis-giv-ings now and bent up-on nar-row-ly ob-serv-ing so cu-ri-ous a crea-ture When at last his mind seemed made up touch-ing the char-ac-ter of his bed-fel-low and he be-came as it were rec-on-ciled to the fact he jumped out up-on the floor and by cer-tain signs and sounds gave me to un-der-stand that if it pleased me he would dress first and then leave me to dress af-ter-wards leav-ing the whole apart-ment to my-self Thinks I Quee-queg un-der the cir-cum-stances this is a very civ-i-lized over-ture but the truth is the-se sav-ages have an in-nate sense of del-i-ca-cy say what you will it is mar-vel-lous how es-sen-tial-ly po-lite they are I pay this par-tic-u-lar com-pli-ment to Quee-queg be-cause he treat-ed me with so much ci-vil-i-ty and con-sid-er-a-tion while I was guilty of great rude-ness star-ing at him from the bed and watch-ing all his toi-let-te mo-tions for the time my cu-rios-i-ty get-ting the bet-ter of my breed-ing Nev-er-the-less a man like Quee-queg you don t see ev-ery day he and his ways were well worth un-usu-al re-gard-ing He com-menced dress-ing at top by don-ning his beaver hat a very tall one by the by and then still mi-nus his trowser-s he hunt-ed up his boots What un-der the heav-ens he did it for I can-not tell but his next move-ment was to crush him-self boots in hand and hat on un-der the bed when from sundry vi-o-lent gasp-ings and strain-ings I in-ferred he was hard at work boot-ing him-self though by no law of pro-pri-ety that I ev-er heard of is any man re-quired to be pri-vate when putting on his boots But Quee-queg do you see was a crea-ture in the tran-si-tion stage nei-ther cater-pil-lar nor but-ter-fly He was just enough civ-i-lized to show off his out-landish-ness in the strangest pos-si-ble man-ners His ed-u-ca-tion was not yet com-plet-ed He was an un-der-grad-u-ate If he had not been a small de-gree civ-i-lized he very prob-a-bly would not have trou-bled him-self with boots at all but then if he had not been still a sav-age he nev-er would have dreamt of get-ting un-der the bed to put them on At last he emerged with his hat very much dent-ed and crushed down over his eyes and be-gan creak-ing and limp-ing about the room as if not be-ing much ac-cus-tomed to boots his pair of damp wrin-kled cowhide ones prob-a-bly not made to or-der ei-ther rather pinched and tor-ment-ed him at the first go off of a bit-ter cold morn-ing See-ing now that there were no cur-tains to the win-dow and that the street be-ing very nar-row the house op-po-site com-mand-ed a plain view in-to the room and ob-serv-ing more and more the in-deco-rous fig-ure that Quee-queg made staving about with lit-tle else but his hat and boots on I begged him as well as I could to ac-cel-er-ate his toi-let some-what and par-tic-u-lar-ly to get in-to his pan-taloons as soon as pos-si-ble He com-plied and then pro-ceed-ed to wash him-self At that time in the morn-ing any Chris-tian would have washed his face but Quee-queg to my amaze-ment con-tent-ed him-self with re-strict-ing his ablu-tions to his chest ar-ms and hands He then donned his waist-coat and tak-ing up a piece of hard soap on the wash stand cen-tre table dipped it in-to wa-ter and com-menced lath-er-ing his face I was watch-ing to see where he kept his ra-zor when lo and be-hold he takes the har-poon from the bed cor-ner slips out the long wood-en stock un-sheathes the head whets it a lit-tle on his boot and strid-ing up to the bit of mir-ror again-st the wall be-gins a vig-or-ous scrap-ing or rather har-poon-ing of his cheeks Thinks I Quee-queg this is us-ing Roger-s s best cut-lery with a vengeance After-wards I won-dered the less at this op-er-a-tion when I came to know of what fine steel the head of a har-poon is made and how ex-ceed-ing-ly sharp the long straight edges are al-ways kept The rest of his toi-let was soon achieved and he proud-ly marched out of the room wrapped up in his great pi-lot mon-key jack-et and sport-ing his har-poon like a mar-shal s ba-ton CHAPTER 5 Break-fast I quick-ly fol-lowed suit and de-scend-ing in-to the bar room ac-cost-ed the grin-ning land-lord very pleas-ant-ly I cher-ished no mal-ice to-wards him though he had been sky-lark-ing with me not a lit-tle in the mat-ter of my bed-fel-low How-ev-er a good laugh is a mighty good thing and rather too scarce a good thing the more s the pity So if any one man in his own prop-er per-son af-ford stuff for a good joke to any-body let him not be back-ward but let him cheer-ful-ly al-low him-self to spend and be spent in that way And the man that has any-thing boun-ti-ful-ly laugh-able about him be sure there is more in that man than you per-haps think for The bar room was now full of the board-ers who had been drop-ping in the night pre-vi-ous and whom I had not as yet had a good look at They were near-ly all whale-men chief mates and sec-ond mates and third mates and sea car-pen-ters and sea coop-ers and sea black-smiths and har-pooneers and ship keep-ers a brown and brawny com-pa-ny with bosky beards an un-shorn shag-gy set all wear-ing mon-key jack-ets for morn-ing gowns You could pret-ty plain-ly tell how long each one had been ashore This young fel-low s healthy cheek is like a sun toast-ed pear in hue and would seem to smell al-most as musky he can-not have been three days land-ed from his In-di-an voy-age That man next him looks a few shades lighter you might say a touch of sat-in wood is in him In the com-plex-ion of a third still lingers a trop-ic tawn but slight-ly bleached with-al he doubtless has tar-ried whole weeks ashore But who could show a cheek like Quee-queg which barred with var-i-ous tin-ts seemed like the An-des west-ern slope to show forth in one ar-ray con-trast-ing cli-mates zone by zone  Grub ho  now cried the land-lord fling-ing open a door and in we went to break-fast They say that men who have seen the world there-by be-come quite at ease in man-ner quite self pos-sessed in com-pa-ny Not al-ways though Led-yard the great New Eng-land trav-eller and Mun-go Park the Scotch one of all men they pos-sessed the least as-sur-ance in the par-lor But per-haps the mere cross-ing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as Led-yard did or the tak-ing a long soli-tary walk on an emp-ty stom-ach in the ne-gro heart of Africa which was the sum of poor Mun-go s per-for-mances this kind of trav-el I say may not be the very best mode of at-tain-ing a high so-cial pol-ish Still for the most part that sort of thing is to be had any-where Th-e-se re-flec-tions just here are oc-ca-sioned by the cir-cum-stance that af-ter we were all seat-ed at the table and I was prepar-ing to hear some good sto-ries about whal-ing to my no small sur-prise near-ly ev-ery man main-tained a pro-found si-lence And not on-ly that but they looked em-bar-rassed Yes here were a set of sea dogs many of whom with-out the slight-est bash-ful-ness had board-ed great whales on the high seas en-tire strangers to them and du-elled them dead with-out wink-ing and yet here they sat at a so-cial break-fast table all of the same call-ing all of kin-dred tastes look-ing round as sheep-ish-ly at each oth-er as though they had nev-er been out of sight of some sheep-fold among the Green Moun-tains A cu-ri-ous sight the-se bash-ful bears the-se timid war-rior whale-men But as for Quee-queg why Quee-queg sat there among them at the head of the table too it so chanced as cool as an ici-cle To be sure I can-not say much for his breed-ing His great-est ad-mirer could not have cor-dial-ly jus-ti-fied his bring-ing his har-poon in-to break-fast with him and us-ing it there with-out cer-e-mony reach-ing over the table with it to the im-mi-nent jeop-ardy of many heads and grap-pling the beef-steaks to-wards him But that was cer-tain-ly very cool-ly done by him and ev-ery one knows that in most peo-ple s es-ti-ma-tion to do any-thing cool-ly is to do it gen-teel-ly We will not speak of all Quee-queg s pe-cu-liar-i-ties here how he es-chewed cof-fee and hot rol-ls and ap-plied his un-di-vid-ed at-ten-tion to beef-steaks done rare Enough that when break-fast was over he with-drew like the rest in-to the pub-lic room light-ed his tom-a-hawk pipe and was sit-ting there qui-et-ly di-gest-ing and smok-ing with his in-sep-a-ra-ble hat on when I sal-lied out for a stroll CHAPTER 6 The Street If I had been as-ton-ished at first catch-ing a glimpse of so out-landish an in-di-vid-u-al as Quee-queg cir-cu-lat-ing among the po-lite so-ci-ety of a civ-i-lized town that as-ton-ish-ment soon de-part-ed up-on tak-ing my first day-light stroll through the streets of New Bed-ford In thor-ough-fares nigh the docks any con-sid-er-able sea-port will fre-quent-ly of-fer to view the queer-est look-ing non-de-scrip-ts from for-eign parts Even in Broad-way and Ch-est-nut streets Mediter-ranean mariners will some-times jostle the af-fright-ed ladies Re-gent Street is not un-known to Las-cars and Malays and at Bom-bay in the Apol-lo Green live Yan-kees have of-ten scared the na-tives But New Bed-ford beats all Water Street and Wap-ping In the-se last men-tioned haunts you see on-ly sailors but in New Bed-ford ac-tu-al can-ni-bals stand chat-ting at street cor-ners sav-ages out-right many of whom yet car-ry on their bones un-holy flesh It makes a stranger stare But be-sides the Feegeeans Ton-ga-to-booar-rs Er-ro-mang-goans Pan-nan-gians and Brighg-gians and be-sides the wild spec-i-mens of the whal-ing craft which un-heed-ed reel about the streets you will see oth-er sights still more cu-ri-ous cer-tain-ly more com-i-cal There week-ly ar-rive in this town scores of green Ver-mon-ters and New Hamp-shire men all athirst for gain and glo-ry in the fish-ery They are most-ly young of stal-wart frames fel-lows who have felled forests and now seek to drop the axe and snatch the whale lance Many are as green as the Green Moun-tains whence they came In some things you would think them but a few hours old Look there that chap strut-ting round the cor-ner He wears a beaver hat and swal-low tailed coat gir-dled with a sailor belt and sheath knife Here comes an-oth-er with a sou west-er and a bom-bazine cloak No town bred dandy will com-pare with a coun-try bred one I mean a down-right bump-kin dandy a fel-low that in the dog days will mow his two acres in buck-skin gloves for fear of tan-ning his hands Now when a coun-try dandy like this takes it in-to his head to make a dis-tin-guished rep-u-ta-tion and joins the great whale fish-ery you should see the com-i-cal things he does up-on reach-ing the sea-port In be-speak-ing his sea out-fit he or-ders bell but-tons to his waist-coats straps to his can-vas trowsers Ah poor Hay Seed how bit-ter-ly will burst those straps in the first howl-ing gale when thou art driven straps but-tons and all down the throat of the tem-pest But think not that this fa-mous town has on-ly har-pooneers can-ni-bals and bump-kins to show her vis-i-tors Not at all Still New Bed-ford is a queer place Had it not been for us whale-men that tract of land would this day per-haps have been in as howl-ing con-di-tion as the coast of Labrador As it is parts of her back coun-try are enough to fright-en one they look so bony The town it-self is per-haps the dear-est place to live in in all New Eng-land It is a land of oil true enough but not like Canaan a land al-so of corn and wine The streets do not run with milk nor in the spring time do they pave them with fresh eggs Yet in spite of this nowhere in all Amer-i-ca will you find more pa-tri-cian like hous-es parks and gar-dens more op-u-lent than in New Bed-ford Whence came they how plant-ed up-on this on-ce scrag-gy sco-ria of a coun-try Go and gaze up-on the iron em-blem-at-i-cal har-poons round yon-der lofty man-sion and your ques-tion will be an-swered Yes all the-se brave hous-es and flow-ery gar-dens came from the At-lantic Paci-fic and In-di-an oceans One and all they were har-pooned and dragged up hith-er from the bot-tom of the sea Can Herr Alexan-der per-form a feat like that In New Bed-ford fa-thers they say give whales for dow-ers to their daugh-ters and por-tion off their nieces with a few por-pois-es a piece You must go to New Bed-ford to see a bril-liant wed-ding for they say they have reser-voirs of oil in ev-ery house and ev-ery night reck-less-ly burn their lengths in sper-ma-ceti can-dles In sum-mer time the town is sweet to see full of fine maples long av-enues of green and gold And in Au-gust high in air the beau-ti-ful and boun-ti-ful horse chest-nuts can-de-labra wise prof-fer the passer by their ta-per-ing up-right cones of con-gre-gat-ed blos-soms So om-nipo-tent is art which in many a dis-trict of New Bed-ford has su-perin-duced bright ter-races of flow-ers up-on the bar-ren re-fuse rocks thrown aside at cre-ation s fi-nal day And the wom-en of New Bed-ford they bloom like their own red ros-es But ros-es on-ly bloom in sum-mer where-as the fine car-na-tion of their cheeks is peren-ni-al as sun-light in the sev-en-th heav-ens Else-where match that bloom of theirs ye can-not save in Salem where they tell me the young girls breathe such musk their sailor sweet-hearts smell them miles off shore as though they were draw-ing nigh the odor-ous Moluc-cas in-stead of the Pu-ri-tan-ic sands CHAPTER 7 The Chapel In this same New Bed-ford there stands a Whale-man s Chapel and few are the moody fish-er-men short-ly bound for the In-di-an Ocean or Paci-fic who fail to make a Sun-day vis-it to the spot I am sure that I did not Re-turn-ing from my first morn-ing stroll I again sal-lied out up-on this spe-cial er-rand The sky had changed from clear sun-ny cold to driv-ing sleet and mist Wrap-ping my-self in my shag-gy jack-et of the cloth called bearskin I fought my way again-st the stub-born storm En-ter-ing I found a small scat-tered con-gre-ga-tion of sailors and sailors wives and wid-ows A muf-fled si-lence reigned on-ly bro-ken at times by the shrieks of the storm Each silent wor-ship-per seemed pur-pose-ly sit-ting apart from the oth-er as if each silent grief were in-su-lar and in-com-mu-ni-ca-ble The chap-lain had not yet ar-rived and there the-se silent is-lands of men and wom-en sat stead-fast-ly eye-ing sev-er-al mar-ble tablets with black bor-ders ma-soned in-to the wall on ei-ther side the pul-pit Three of them ran some-thing like the fol-low-ing but I do not pre-tend to quote  SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF JOHN TALBOT Who at the age of eigh-teen was lost over-board

Is erect-ed to his Me-mory BY HIS WIDOW Shak-ing off the sleet from my ice glazed hat and jack-et I seat-ed my-self near the door and turn-ing side-ways was sur-prised to see Quee-queg near me Af-fect-ed by the solem-ni-ty of the scene there was a won-der-ing gaze of in-cred-u-lous cu-rios-i-ty in his coun-te-nance This sav-age was the on-ly per-son pre-sent who seemed to no-tice my en-trance be-cause he was the on-ly one who could not read and there-fore was not read-ing those frigid in-scrip-tions on the wall Whether any of the rel-a-tives of the sea-men whose names ap-peared there were now among the con-gre-ga-tion I knew not but so many are the un-record-ed ac-ci-den-ts in the fish-ery and so plain-ly did sev-er-al wom-en pre-sent wear the coun-te-nance if not the trap-pings of some un-ceas-ing grief that I feel sure that here be-fore me were as-sem-bled those in whose un-heal-ing hearts the sight of those bleak tablets sym-pa-thet-i-cal-ly caused the old wounds to bleed afresh Oh ye whose dead lie buried be-neath the green grass who stand-ing among flow-ers can say here here lies my beloved ye know not the des-o-la-tion that broods in bo-soms like the-se What bit-ter blanks in those black bor-dered mar-bles which cov-er no ash-es What de-spair in those im-mov-able in-scrip-tions What dead-ly voids and un-bid-den in-fi-deli-ties in the lines

what cen-sus of liv-ing crea-tures the dead of mankind are in-clud-ed why it is that a uni-ver-sal proverb says of them that they tell no tales though con-tain-ing more se-crets than the Good-win

so strive to hush all the dead where-fore but the ru-mor of a knock-ing in a tomb will ter-ri-fy a whole city All the-se things are not with-out their mean-ings But Faith like a jack-al feeds among the tombs and even from the-se dead doubts she gath-ers her most vi-tal hope It needs scarce-ly to be told with what feel-ings on the eve of a Nan-tuck-et voy-age I re-gard-ed those mar-ble tablets and by the murky light of that dark-ened dole-ful day read the fate of the whale-men who had gone be-fore me Yes Ish-mael the same fate may be thine But some-how I grew mer-ry again De-light-ful in-duce-men-ts to em-bark fine chance for pro-mo-tion it seem-s aye a stove boat will make me an im-mor-tal by brevet Yes there is death in this busi-ness of whal-ing a speech-less-ly quick chaotic bundling of a man in-to Eter-ni-ty But what then Me-thinks we have huge-ly mis-tak-en this mat-ter of Life and Death Me-thinks that what they call my shad-ow here on earth is my true sub-stance Me-thinks that in look-ing at things spir-i-tu-al we are too much like oys-ters ob-serv-ing the sun through the wa-ter and think-ing that thick wa-ter the thinnest of air Me-thinks my body is but the lees of my bet-ter be-ing In fact take my body who will take it I say it is not me And there-fore three cheers for Nan-tuck-et and come a stove boat and stove body when they will for stave my soul Jove him-self can-not CHAPTER 8 The Pul-pit I had not been seat-ed very long ere a man of a cer-tain ven-er-a-ble ro-bust-ness en-tered im-me-di-ate-ly as the storm pelt-ed door flew back up-on ad-mit-ting him a quick re-gard-ful eye-ing of him by all the con-gre-ga-tion suf-fi-cient-ly at-test-ed that this fine old man was the chap-lain Yes it was the fa-mous Father Map-ple so called by the whale-men among whom he was a very great favourite He had been a sailor and a har-pooneer in his youth but for many years past had ded-i-cat-ed his life to the min-istry At the time I now write of Father Map-ple was in the hardy win-ter of a healthy old age that sort of old age which seems merg-ing in-to a sec-ond flow-er-ing youth for among all the fis-sures of his wrin-kles there shone cer-tain mild gleams of a new-ly de-vel-op-ing bloom the spring ver-dure peep-ing forth even be-neath Fe-bru-ary s snow No one hav-ing pre-vi-ous-ly heard his his-to-ry could for the first time be-hold Father Map-ple with-out the ut-most in-ter-est be-cause there were cer-tain en-graft-ed cler-i-cal pe-cu-liar-i-ties about him im-putable to that ad-ven-tur-ous mar-itime life he had led When he en-tered I ob-served that he car-ried no um-brel-la and cer-tain-ly had not come in his car-riage for his tarpaulin hat ran down with melt-ing sleet and his great pi-lot cloth jack-et seemed al-most to drag him to the floor with the weight of the wa-ter it had ab-sorbed How-ev-er hat and coat and over-shoes were one by one re-moved and hung up in a lit-tle space in an ad-ja-cent cor-ner when ar-rayed in a de-cent suit he qui-et-ly ap-proached the pul-pit Like most old fash-ioned pul-pits it was a very lofty one and since a reg-u-lar stairs to such a height would by its long an-gle with the floor se-ri-ous-ly con-tract the al-ready small area of the chapel the ar-chi-tect it seemed had act-ed up-on the hint of Father Map-ple and fin-ished the pul-pit with-out a stairs sub-sti-tut-ing a per-pen-dic-u-lar side lad-der like those used in mount-ing a ship from a boat at sea The wife of a whal-ing cap-tain had pro-vid-ed the chapel with a hand-some pair of red worsted man ropes for this lad-der which be-ing it-self nice-ly head-ed and stained with a ma-hogany colour the whole con-trivance con-sid-er-ing what man-ner of chapel it was seemed by no means in bad taste Halt-ing for an in-stant at the foot of the lad-der and with both hands grasp-ing the or-na-men-tal knobs of the man ropes Father Map-ple cast a look up-wards and then with a tru-ly sailor like but still rev-er-en-tial dex-ter-i-ty hand over hand mount-ed the steps as if as-cend-ing the main top of his ves-sel The per-pen-dic-u-lar parts of this side lad-der as is usu-al-ly the case with swing-ing ones were of cloth cov-ered rope on-ly the rounds were of wood so that at ev-ery step there was a joint At my first glimpse of the pul-pit it had not es-caped me that how-ev-er con-ve-nient for a ship the-se join-ts in the pre-sent in-stance seemed un-nec-es-sary For I was not pre-pared to see Father Map-ple af-ter gain-ing the height slow-ly turn round and stoop-ing over the pul-pit de-lib-er-ate-ly drag up the lad-der step by step till the whole was de-posit-ed with-in leav-ing him im-preg-nable in his lit-tle Que-bec I pon-dered some time with-out ful-ly com-pre-hend-ing the rea-son for this Father Map-ple en-joyed such a wide rep-u-ta-tion for sin-cer-i-ty and sanc-ti-ty that I could not sus-pect him of court-ing no-to-ri-ety by any mere tricks of the stage No thought I there must be some sober rea-son for this thing fur-ther-more it must sym-bol-ize some-thing un-seen Can it be then that by that act of phys-i-cal iso-la-tion he sig-ni-fies his spir-i-tu-al with-drawal for the time from all out-ward world-ly ties and con-nex-ions Yes for re-plen-ished with the meat and wine of the word to the faith-ful man of God this pul-pit I see is a self con-tain-ing stronghold a lofty Ehren-bre-it-stein with a peren-ni-al well of wa-ter with-in the wal-ls But the side lad-der was not the on-ly strange fea-ture of the place bor-rowed from the chap-lain s for-mer sea far-ings Between the mar-ble ceno-taphs on ei-ther hand of the pul-pit the wall which formed its back was adorned with a large paint-ing rep-re-sent-ing a gal-lant ship beat-ing again-st a ter-ri-ble storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy break-ers But high above the fly-ing scud and dark rolling clouds there float-ed a lit-tle isle of sun-light from which beamed forth an an-gel s face and this bright face shed a dis-tinct spot of ra-di-ance up-on the ship s tossed deck some-thing like that sil-ver plate now in-sert-ed in-to the Vic-to-ry s plank where Nel-son fell  Ah no-ble ship  the an-gel seemed to say  beat on beat on thou no-ble ship and bear a hardy helm for lo the sun is break-ing through the clouds are rolling of-f seren-est azure is at hand  Nor was the pul-pit it-self with-out a trace of the same sea taste that had achieved the lad-der and the pic-ture Its pan-elled front was in the like-ness of a ship s bluff bows and the Holy Bi-ble rest-ed on a pro-ject-ing piece of scroll work fash-ioned af-ter a ship s fid-dle head-ed beak What could be more full of mean-ing  for the pul-pit is ev-er this earth s fore-most part all the rest comes in its rear the pul-pit leads the world From thence it is the storm of God s quick wrath is first de-scried and the bow must bear the ear-li-est brunt From thence it is the God of breezes fair or foul is first in-voked for favourable winds Yes the world s a ship on its pas-sage out and not a voy-age com-plete and the pul-pit is its prow CHAPTER 9 The Ser-mon Father Map-ple rose and in a mild voice of unas-sum-ing au-thor-i-ty or-dered the scat-tered peo-ple to con-dense  Star-board gang-way there side away to lar-board lar-board gang-way to star-board Mid-ships mid-ships  There was a low rum-bling of heavy sea boots among the bench-es and a still slighter shuf-fling of wom-en s shoes and all was qui-et again and ev-ery eye on the preacher He paused a lit-tle then kneel-ing in the pul-pit s bows fold-ed his large brown hands across his chest up-lift-ed his closed eyes and of-fered a prayer so deeply de-vout that he seemed kneel-ing and pray-ing at the bot-tom of the sea This end-ed in pro-longed solemn tones like the con-tin-u-al tolling of a bell in a ship that is founder-ing at sea in a fog in such tones he com-menced read-ing the fol-low-ing hymn but chang-ing his man-ner to-wards the con-clud-ing stan-zas burst forth with a peal-ing ex-ul-ta-tion and joy  The ribs and ter-rors in the whale Arched over me a dis-mal gloom While all God s sun lit waves rolled by And lift me deep-en-ing down to doom  I saw the open-ing maw of hell With end-less pains and sor-rows there Which none but they that feel can tel-l Oh I was plung-ing to de-spair  In black dis-tress I called my God When I could scarce be-lieve him mine He bowed his ear to my com-plaints No more the whale did me con-fine  With speed he flew to my re-lief As on a ra-di-ant dol-phin borne Aw-ful yet bright as light-ning shone The face of my De-liv-erer God  My song for ev-er shall record That ter-ri-ble that joy-ful hour I give the glo-ry to my God His all the mer-cy and the pow-er  Near-ly all joined in singing this hymn which swelled high above the howl-ing of the storm A brief pause en-sued the preacher slow-ly turned over the leaves of the Bi-ble and at last fold-ing his hand down up-on the prop-er page said  Beloved ship-mates clinch the last verse of the first chap-ter of Jon-ah  And God had pre-pared a great fish to swal-low up Jon-ah    Ship-mates this book con-tain-ing on-ly four chap-ter-s four yarn-s is one of the small-est strands in the mighty ca-ble of the Scrip-tures Yet what depths of the soul does Jon-ah s deep sealine sound what a preg-nant lesson to us is this prophet What a no-ble thing is that can-ti-cle in the fish s bel-ly How bil-low like and bois-ter-ous-ly grand We feel the floods surg-ing over us we sound with him to the kelpy bot-tom of the wa-ters sea weed and all the slime of the sea is about us But what is this lesson that the book of Jon-ah teach-es Ship-mates it is a two strand-ed lesson a lesson to us all as sin-ful men and a lesson to me as a pi-lot of the liv-ing God As sin-ful men it is a lesson to us all be-cause it is a sto-ry of the sin hard heart-ed-ness sud-den-ly awak-ened fears the swift pun-ish-ment re-pen-tance prayers and fi-nal-ly the de-liv-er-ance and joy of Jon-ah As with all sin-ners among men the sin of this son of Amit-tai was in his wil-ful dis-obe-di-ence of the com-mand of God nev-er mind now what that com-mand was or how con-veyed which he found a hard com-mand But all the things that God would have us do are hard for us to do re-mem-ber that and hence he of-ten-er com-mands us than en-deav-ors to per-suade And if we obey God we must dis-obey our-selves and it is in this dis-obey-ing our-selves where-in the hard-ness of obey-ing God con-sists  With this sin of dis-obe-di-ence in him Jon-ah still fur-ther flouts at God by seek-ing to flee from Him He thinks that a ship made by men will car-ry him in-to coun-tries where God does not reign but on-ly the Cap-tains of this earth He skulks about the wharves of Jop-pa and seeks a ship that s bound for Tarshish There lurks per-haps a hith-er-to un-heed-ed mean-ing here By all ac-coun-ts Tarshish could have been no oth-er city than the mod-ern Cadiz That s the opin-ion of learned men And where is Cadiz ship-mates Cadiz is in Spain as far by wa-ter from Jop-pa as Jon-ah could pos-si-bly have sailed in those an-cient days when the At-lantic was an al-most un-known sea Be-cause Jop-pa the mod-ern Jaf-fa ship-mates is on the most east-er-ly coast of the Mediter-ranean the Syr-i-an and Tarshish or Cadiz more than two thou-sand miles to the west-ward from that just out-side the Straits of Gi-bral-tar See ye not then ship-mates that Jon-ah sought to flee world wide from God Mis-er-able man Oh most con-temptible and wor-thy of all scorn with slouched hat and guilty eye skulk-ing from his God prowl-ing among the ship-ping like a vile bur-glar has-ten-ing to cross the seas So dis-or-dered self con-demn-ing is his look that had there been po-lice-men in those days Jon-ah on the mere sus-pi-cion of some-thing wrong had been ar-rest-ed ere he touched a deck How plain-ly he s a fugi-tive no bag-gage not a hat box valise or car-pet bag  no friends ac-com-pa-ny him to the wharf with their adieux At last af-ter much dodg-ing search he finds the Tarshish ship re-ceiv-ing the last items of her car-go and as he steps on board to see its Cap-tain in the cab-in all the sailors for the mo-ment de-sist from hoist-ing in the goods to mark the stranger s evil eye Jon-ah sees this but in vain he tries to look all ease and con-fi-dence in vain es-says his wretched smile Strong in-tu-itions of the man as-sure the mariners he can be no in-no-cent In their game-some but still se-ri-ous way one whis-pers to the oth-er  Jack he s robbed a wid-ow  or  Joe do you mark him he s a bigamist  or  Har-ry lad I guess he s the adul-terer that broke jail in old Go-mor-rah or be-like one of the miss-ing mur-der-ers from Sodom  Another runs to read the bill that s stuck again-st the spile up-on the wharf to which the ship is moored of-fer-ing five hun-dred gold coins for the ap-pre-hen-sion of a par-ri-cide and con-tain-ing a de-scrip-tion of his per-son He reads and looks from Jon-ah to the bill while all his sym-pa-thet-ic ship-mates now crowd round Jon-ah pre-pared to lay their hands up-on him Fright-ed Jon-ah trem-bles and sum-mon-ing all his bold-ness to his face on-ly looks so much the more a cow-ard He will not con-fess him-self sus-pect-ed but that it-self is strong sus-pi-cion So he makes the best of it and when the sailors find him not to be the man that is ad-ver-tised they let him pass and he de-scends in-to the cab-in   Who s there  cries the Cap-tain at his busy desk hur-ried-ly mak-ing out his pa-pers for the Cus-tom-s  Who s there  Oh how that harm-less ques-tion man-gles Jon-ah For the in-stant he al-most turns to flee again But he ral-lies  I seek a pas-sage in this ship to Tarshish how soon sail ye sir  Thus far the busy Cap-tain had not looked up to Jon-ah though the man now stands be-fore him but no soon-er does he hear that hol-low voice than he darts a scru-ti-niz-ing glance  We sail with the next com-ing tide  at last he slow-ly an-swered still in-tent-ly eye-ing him  No soon-er sir    Soon enough for any hon-est man that goes a pas-sen-ger  Ha Jon-ah that s an-oth-er stab But he swift-ly cal-ls away the Cap-tain from that scent  I ll sail with ye   he says   the pas-sage mon-ey how much is that  I ll pay now  For it is par-tic-u-lar-ly writ-ten ship-mates as if it were a thing not to be over-looked in this his-to-ry  that he paid the fare there-of ere the craft did sail And tak-en with the con-text this is full of mean-ing  Now Jon-ah s Cap-tain ship-mates was one whose dis-cern-ment de-tec-ts crime in any but whose cu-pid-i-ty ex-pos-es it on-ly in the pen-ni-less In this world ship-mates sin that pays its way can trav-el freely and with-out a pass-port where-as Virtue if a pau-per is stopped at all fron-tiers So Jon-ah s Cap-tain pre-pares to test the length of Jon-ah s purse ere he judge him open-ly He charges him thrice the usu-al sum and it s as-sent-ed to Then the Cap-tain knows that Jon-ah is a fugi-tive but at the same time re-solves to help a flight that paves its rear with gold Yet when Jon-ah fair-ly takes out his purse pru-dent sus-pi-cions still mo-lest the Cap-tain He rings ev-ery coin to find a coun-ter-feit Not a forg-er any way he mut-ters and Jon-ah is put down for his pas-sage  Point out my state room Sir  says Jon-ah now  I m trav-el weary I need sleep   Thou lookest like it  says the Cap-tain  there s thy room  Jon-ah en-ters and would lock the door but the lock con-tains no key Hear-ing him fool-ish-ly fum-bling there the Cap-tain laughs low-ly to him-self and mut-ters some-thing about the doors of con-vict-s cel-ls be-ing nev-er al-lowed to be locked with-in All dressed and dusty as he is Jon-ah throws him-self in-to his berth and finds the lit-tle state room ceil-ing al-most rest-ing on his fore-head The air is close and Jon-ah gasps Then in that con-tract-ed hole sunk too be-neath the ship s wa-ter line Jon-ah feels the herald-ing pre-sen-ti-ment of that sti-fling hour when the whale shall hold him in the small-est of his bow-el-s wards  Screwed at its ax-is again-st the side a swing-ing lamp slight-ly os-cil-lates in Jon-ah s room and the ship heel-ing over to-wards the wharf with the weight of the last bales re-ceived the lamp flame and all though in slight mo-tion still main-tains a per-ma-nent obliq-ui-ty with ref-er-ence to the room though in truth in-fal-li-bly straight it-self it but made ob-vi-ous the false ly-ing lev-els among which it hung The lamp alar-ms and fright-ens Jon-ah as ly-ing in his berth his tor-ment-ed eyes roll round the place and this thus far suc-cess-ful fugi-tive finds no refuge for his rest-less glance But that con-tra-dic-tion in the lamp more and more ap-pals him The floor the ceil-ing and the side are all awry  Oh so my con-science hangs in me  he groans  straight up-wards so it burns but the cham-bers of my soul are all in crooked-ness   Like one who af-ter a night of drunk-en rev-el-ry hies to his bed still reel-ing but with con-science yet prick-ing him as the plung-ings of the Ro-man race horse but so much the more strike his steel tags in-to him as one who in that mis-er-able plight still turns and turns in gid-dy an-guish pray-ing God for an-ni-hi-la-tion un-til the fit be passed and at last amid the whirl of woe he feels a deep stu-por steals over him as over the man who bleeds to death for con-science is the wound and there s naught to staunch it so af-ter sore wrestlings in his berth Jon-ah s prodi-gy of pon-der-ous mis-ery drags him drown-ing down to sleep  And now the time of tide has come the ship casts off her ca-bles and from the de-sert-ed wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish all ca-reen-ing glides to sea That ship my friends was the first of record-ed smug-glers the con-tra-band was Jon-ah But the sea rebels he will not bear the wicked bur-den A dread-ful storm comes on the ship is like to break But now when the boatswain cal-ls all hands to light-en her when box-es bales and jars are clat-ter-ing over-board when the wind is shriek-ing and the men are yelling and ev-ery plank thun-ders with tram-pling feet right over Jon-ah s head in all this rag-ing tu-mult Jon-ah sleeps his hideous sleep He sees no black sky and rag-ing sea feels not the reel-ing tim-bers and lit-tle hears he or heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale which even now with open mouth is cleav-ing the seas af-ter him Aye ship-mates Jon-ah was gone down in-to the sides of the ship a berth in the cab-in as I have tak-en it and was fast asleep But the fright-ened mas-ter comes to him and shrieks in his dead ear  What meanest thou O sleep-er arise  Star-tled from his lethar-gy by that dire-ful cry Jon-ah stag-gers to his feet and stum-bling to the deck grasps a shroud to look out up-on the sea But at that mo-ment he is sprung up-on by a pan-ther bil-low leap-ing over the bul-warks Wave af-ter wave thus leaps in-to the ship and find-ing no speedy vent runs roar-ing fore and aft till the mariners come nigh to drown-ing while yet afloat And ev-er as the white moon shows her af-fright-ed face from the steep gul-lies in the black-ness over-head aghast Jon-ah sees the rear-ing bowsprit point-ing high up-ward but soon beat down-ward again to-wards the tor-ment-ed deep  Ter-rors up-on ter-rors run shout-ing through his soul In all his cring-ing at-ti-tudes the God fugi-tive is now too plain-ly known The sailors mark him more and more cer-tain grow their sus-pi-cions of him and at last ful-ly to test the truth by re-fer-ring the whole mat-ter to high Heav-en they fall to cast-ing lots to see for whose cause this great tem-pest was up-on them The lot is Jon-ah s that dis-cov-ered then how fu-ri-ous-ly they mob him with their ques-tions  What is thine oc-cu-pa-tion Whence comest thou Thy coun-try What peo-ple But mark now my ship-mates the be-hav-ior of poor Jon-ah The ea-ger mariners but ask him who he is and where from where-as they not on-ly re-ceive an an-swer to those ques-tions but like-wise an-oth-er an-swer to a ques-tion not put by them but the un-so-licit-ed an-swer is forced from Jon-ah by the hard hand of God that is up-on him   I am a He-brew  he cries and then  I fear the Lord the God of Heav-en who hath made the sea and the dry land  Fear him O Jon-ah Aye well might-est thou fear the Lord God then Straight-way he now goes on to make a full con-fes-sion where-upon the mariners be-came more and more ap-palled but still are piti-ful For when Jon-ah not yet sup-pli-cat-ing God for mer-cy since he but too well knew the dark-ness of his deserts  when wretched Jon-ah cries out to them to take him and cast him forth in-to the sea for he knew that for his sake this great tem-pest was up-on them they mer-ci-ful-ly turn from him and seek by oth-er means to save the ship But all in vain the in-dig-nant gale howls loud-er then with one hand raised in-vok-ing-ly to God with the oth-er they not un-re-luc-tant-ly lay hold of Jon-ah  And now be-hold Jon-ah tak-en up as an an-chor and dropped in-to the sea when in-stant-ly an oily calm-ness floats out from the east and the sea is still as Jon-ah car-ries down the gale with him leav-ing smooth wa-ter be-hind He goes down in the whirling heart of such a mas-ter-less com-mo-tion that he scarce heeds the mo-ment when he drops seething in-to the yawn-ing jaws await-ing him and the whale shoots to all his ivory teeth like so many white bolts up-on his pris-on Then Jon-ah prayed un-to the Lord out of the fish s bel-ly But ob-serve his prayer and learn a weighty lesson For sin-ful as he is Jon-ah does not weep and wail for di-rect de-liv-er-ance He feels that his dread-ful pun-ish-ment is just He leaves all his de-liv-er-ance to God con-tent-ing him-self with this that spite of all his pains and pangs he will still look to-wards His holy tem-ple And here ship-mates is true and faith-ful re-pen-tance not clam-orous for par-don but grate-ful for pun-ish-ment And how pleas-ing to God was this con-duct in Jon-ah is shown in the even-tu-al de-liv-er-ance of him from the sea and the whale Ship-mates I do not place Jon-ah be-fore you to be copied for his sin but I do place him be-fore you as a mod-el for re-pen-tance Sin not but if you do take heed to re-pent of it like Jon-ah  While he was speak-ing the-se words the howl-ing of the shriek-ing slant-ing storm with-out seemed to add new pow-er to the preacher who when de-scrib-ing Jon-ah s sea storm seemed tossed by a storm him-self His deep chest heaved as with a ground swell his tossed ar-ms seemed the war-ring el-e-men-ts at work and the thun-ders that rolled away from off his swarthy brow and the light leap-ing from his eye made all his sim-ple hear-ers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them There now came a lull in his look as he silent-ly turned over the leaves of the Book on-ce more and at last stand-ing mo-tion-less with closed eyes for the mo-ment seemed com-muning with God and him-self But again he leaned over to-wards the peo-ple and bow-ing his head low-ly with an as-pect of the deep-est yet man-li-est hu-mil-i-ty he spake the-se words  Ship-mates God has laid but one hand up-on you both his hands press up-on me I have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that Jon-ah teach-es to all sin-ners and there-fore to ye and still more to me for I am a greater sin-ner than ye And now how glad-ly would I come down from this mast head and sit on the hatch-es there where you sit and lis-ten as you lis-ten while some one of you reads me that oth-er and more aw-ful lesson which Jon-ah teach-es to me as a pi-lot of the liv-ing God How be-ing an anoint-ed pi-lot prophet or speak-er of true things and bid-den by the Lord to sound those un-wel-come truths in the ears of a wicked Nin-eveh Jon-ah ap-palled at the hos-til-i-ty he should raise fled from his mis-sion and sought to es-cape his du-ty and his God by tak-ing ship at Jop-pa But God is ev-ery-where Tarshish he nev-er reached As we have seen God came up-on him in the whale and swal-lowed him down to liv-ing gulfs of doom and with swift slant-ings tore him along  in-to the mid-st of the seas  where the ed-dy-ing depths sucked him ten thou-sand fath-oms down and  the weeds were wrapped about his head  and all the wa-tery world of woe bowled over him Yet even then be-yond the reach of any plum-met  out of the bel-ly of hel-l  when the whale ground-ed up-on the ocean s ut-most bones even then God heard the en-gulphed re-pent-ing prophet when he cried Then God spake un-to the fish and from the shud-der-ing cold and black-ness of the sea the whale came breech-ing up to-wards the warm and pleas-ant sun and all the de-lights of air and earth and  vom-it-ed out Jon-ah up-on the dry land  when the word of the Lord came a sec-ond time and Jon-ah bruised and beat-en his ears like two sea shel-ls still mul-ti-tudi-nous-ly mur-mur-ing of the ocean Jon-ah did the Almighty s bid-ding And what was that ship-mates To preach the Truth to the face of False-hood That was it  This ship-mates this is that oth-er lesson and woe to that pi-lot of the liv-ing God who slights it Woe to him whom this world char-ms from Gospel du-ty Woe to him who seeks to pour oil up-on the wa-ters when God has brewed them in-to a gale Woe to him who seeks to please rather than to ap-pal Woe to him whose good name is more to him than good-ness Woe to him who in this world courts not dis-hon-or Woe to him who would not be true even though to be false were sal-va-tion Yea woe to him who as the great Pilot Paul has it while preach-ing to oth-ers is him-self a cast-away  He dropped and fell away from him-self for a mo-ment then lift-ing his face to them again showed a deep joy in his eyes as he cried out with a heav-en-ly en-thu-si-asm   But oh ship-mates on the star-board hand of ev-ery woe there is a sure de-light and high-er the top of that de-light than the bot-tom of the woe is deep Is not the main truck high-er than the kel-son is low De-light is to him a far far up-ward and in-ward de-light who again-st the proud gods and com-modor-es of this earth ev-er stands forth his own in-ex-orable self De-light is to him whose strong ar-ms yet sup-port him when the ship of this

breath O Father  chiefly known to me by Thy rod mor-tal or im-mor-tal here I die I have striven to be Thine more than to be this world s or mine own Yet this is noth-ing I leave eter-ni-ty to Thee for what is man that he should live out the life-time of his God  He said no more but slow-ly wav-ing a bene-dic-tion cov-ered his face with his hands and so re-mained kneel-ing till all the peo-ple had de-part-ed and he was left alone in the place CHAPTER 1 A Bo-som Friend Re-turn-ing to the Spouter Inn from the Chapel I found Quee-queg there quite alone he hav-ing left the Chapel be-fore the bene-dic-tion some time He was sit-ting on a bench be-fore the fire with his feet on the stove hearth and in one hand was hold-ing close up to his face that lit-tle ne-gro idol of his peer-ing hard in-to its face and with a jack knife gen-tly whit-tling away at its nose mean-while hum-ming to him-self in his hea-then-ish way But be-ing now in-ter-rupt-ed he put up the im-age and pret-ty soon go-ing to the table took up a large book there and plac-ing it on his lap be-gan count-ing the pages with de-lib-er-ate reg-u-lar-i-ty at ev-ery fifti-eth page as I fan-cied stop-ping a mo-ment look-ing va-cant-ly around him and giv-ing ut-ter-ance to a long drawn gur-gling whistle of as-ton-ish-ment He would then be-gin again at the next fifty seem-ing to com-mence at num-ber one each time as though he could not count more than fifty and it was on-ly by such a large num-ber of fifties be-ing found to-geth-er that his as-ton-ish-ment at the mul-ti-tude of pages was ex-cit-ed With much in-ter-est I sat watch-ing him Sav-age though he was and hideous-ly marred about the face at least to my taste his coun-te-nance yet had a some-thing in it which was by no means dis-agree-able You can-not hide the soul Through all his un-earth-ly tat-too-ings I thought I saw the traces of a sim-ple hon-est heart and in his large deep eyes fiery black and bold there seemed to-kens of a spir-it that would dare a thou-sand dev-ils And be-sides all this there was a cer-tain lofty bear-ing about the Pa-gan which even his un-couth-ness could not al-to-geth-er maim He looked like a man who had nev-er cringed and nev-er had had a cred-i-tor Whether it was too that his head be-ing shaved his fore-head was drawn out in freer and brighter re-lief and looked more ex-pan-sive than it oth-er-wise would this I will not ven-ture to de-cide but cer-tain it was his head was phreno-log-i-cal-ly an ex-cel-lent one It may seem ridicu-lous but it re-mind-ed me of Gen-er-al Wash-ing-ton s head as seen in the pop-u-lar busts of him It had the same long reg-u-lar-ly grad-ed re-treat-ing slope from above the brows which were like-wise very pro-ject-ing like two long promon-to-ries thick-ly wood-ed on top Quee-queg was Ge-orge Wash-ing-ton can-ni-bal-is-ti-cal-ly de-vel-oped Whilst I was thus close-ly scan-ning him half pre-tend-ing mean-while to be look-ing out at the storm from the case-ment he nev-er heed-ed my pres-ence nev-er trou-bled him-self with so much as a sin-gle glance but ap-peared whol-ly oc-cu-pied with count-ing the pages of the mar-vel-lous book Con-sid-er-ing how so-cia-bly we had been sleep-ing to-geth-er the night pre-vi-ous and es-pe-cial-ly con-sid-er-ing the af-fec-tion-ate arm I had found thrown over me up-on wak-ing in the morn-ing I thought this in-dif-fer-ence of his very strange But sav-ages are strange be-ings at times you do not know ex-act-ly how to take them At first they are over-aw-ing their calm self col-lect-ed-ness of sim-plic-i-ty seems a So-crat-ic wis-dom I had no-ticed al-so that Quee-queg nev-er con-sort-ed at all or but very lit-tle with the oth-er sea-men in the inn He made no ad-vances what-ev-er ap-peared to have no de-sire to en-large the cir-cle of his ac-quain-tances All this struck me as mighty sin-gu-lar yet up-on sec-ond thoughts there was some-thing al-most sub-lime in it Here was a man some twen-ty thou-sand miles from home by the way of Cape Horn that is which was the on-ly way he could get there thrown among peo-ple as strange to him as though he were in the plan-et Jupiter and yet he seemed en-tire-ly at his ease pre-serv-ing the ut-most seren-i-ty con-tent with his own com-pan-ion-ship al-ways equal to him-self Sure-ly this was a touch of fine phi-los-o-phy though no doubt he had nev-er heard there was such a thing as that But per-haps to be true philoso-phers we mor-tals should not be con-scious of so liv-ing or so striv-ing So soon as I hear that such or such a man gives him-self out for a philoso-pher I con-clude that like the dys-pep-tic old wom-an he must have  bro-ken his di-gester  As I sat there in that now lone-ly room the fire burn-ing low in that mild stage when af-ter its first in-ten-si-ty has warmed the air it then on-ly glows to be looked at the evening shades and phan-toms gath-er-ing round the case-men-ts and peer-ing in up-on us silent soli-tary twain the storm boom-ing with-out in solemn swells I be-gan to be sen-si-ble of strange feel-ings I felt a melt-ing in me No more my splin-tered heart and mad-dened hand were turned again-st the wolfish world This sooth-ing sav-age had re-deemed it There he sat his very in-dif-fer-ence speak-ing a na-ture in which there lurked no civ-i-lized hypocrisies and bland de-ceits Wild he was a very sight of sights to see yet I be-gan to feel my-self mys-te-ri-ous-ly drawn to-wards him And those same things that would have re-pelled most oth-ers they were the very mag-nets that thus drew me I ll try a pa-gan friend thought I since Chris-tian kind-ness has proved but hol-low cour-tesy I drew my bench near him and made some friend-ly signs and hin-ts do-ing my best to talk with him mean-while At first he lit-tle no-ticed the-se ad-vances but present-ly up-on my re-fer-ring to his last night s hos-pi-tal-i-ties he made out to ask me whether we were again to be bed-fel-lows I told him yes where-at I thought he looked pleased per-haps a lit-tle com-pli-ment-ed We then turned over the book to-geth-er and I en-deav-ored to ex-plain to him the pur-pose of the print-ing and the mean-ing of the few pic-tures that were in it Thus I soon en-gaged his in-ter-est and from that we went to jab-ber-ing the best we could about the var-i-ous out-er sights to be seen in this fa-mous town Soon I pro-posed a so-cial smoke and pro-duc-ing his pouch and tom-a-hawk he qui-et-ly of-fered me a puff And then we sat ex-chang-ing puffs from that wild pipe of his and keep-ing it reg-u-lar-ly pass-ing be-tween us If there yet lurked any ice of in-dif-fer-ence to-wards me in the Pa-gan s breast this pleas-ant ge-nial smoke we had soon thawed it out and left us cronies He seemed to take to me quite as nat-u-ral-ly and un-bid-den-ly as I to him and when our smoke was over he pressed his fore-head again-st mine clasped me round the waist and said that hence-forth we were mar-ried mean-ing in his coun-try s phrase that we were bo-som friends he would glad-ly die for me if need should be In a coun-try-man this sud-den flame of friend-ship would have seemed far too pre-ma-ture a thing to be much dis-trust-ed but in this sim-ple sav-age those old rules would not ap-ply After sup-per and an-oth-er so-cial chat and smoke we went to our room to-geth-er He made me a pre-sent of his em-balmed head took out his enor-mous to-bac-co wal-let and grop-ing un-der the to-bac-co drew out some thir-ty dol-lars in sil-ver then spread-ing them on the table and me-chan-i-cal-ly di-vid-ing them in-to two equal por-tions pushed one of them to-wards me and said it was mine I was go-ing to re-mon-strate but he si-lenced me by pour-ing them in-to my trowser-s pock-ets I let them stay He then went about his evening prayers took out his idol and re-moved the pa-per fire-board By cer-tain signs and symp-toms I thought he seemed anx-ious for me to join him but well know-ing what was to fol-low I de-lib-er-at-ed a mo-ment whether in case he in-vit-ed me I would com-ply or oth-er-wise I was a good Chris-tian born and bred in the bo-som of the in-fal-li-ble Pres-by-te-ri-an Church How then could I unite with this wild idol-a-tor in wor-ship-ping his piece of wood But what is wor-ship thought I Do you sup-pose now Ish-mael that the mag-nan-i-mous God of heav-en and earth pa-gans and all in-clud-ed can pos-si-bly be jeal-ous of an in-signif-i-cant bit of black wood Im-pos-si-ble But what is wor-ship  to do the will of God that is wor-ship And what is the will of God  to do to my fel-low man what I would have my fel-low man to do to me that is the will of God Now Quee-queg is my fel-low man And what do I wish that this Quee-queg would do to me Why unite with me in my par-tic-u-lar Pres-by-te-ri-an form of wor-ship Con-se-quent-ly I must then unite with him in his er-go I must turn idol-a-tor So I kin-dled the shav-ings helped prop up the in-no-cent lit-tle idol of-fered him burnt bis-cuit with Quee-queg salamed be-fore him twice or thrice kissed his nose and that done we un-dressed and went to bed at peace with our own con-sciences and all the world But we did not go to sleep with-out some lit-tle chat How it is I know not but there is no place like a bed for con-fi-den-tial dis-clo-sures be-tween friends Man and wife they say there open the very bot-tom of their souls to each oth-er and some old cou-ples of-ten lie and chat over old times till near-ly morn-ing Thus then in our heart-s hon-ey-moon lay I and Quee-queg a cosy lov-ing pair CHAPTER 11 Night-gown We had lain thus in bed chat-ting and nap-ping at short in-ter-vals and Quee-queg now and then af-fec-tion-ate-ly throw-ing his brown tat-tooed legs over mine and then draw-ing them back so en-tire-ly so-cia-ble and free and easy were we when at last by rea-son of our con-fab-u-la-tions what lit-tle nap-pish-ness re-mained in us al-to-geth-er de-part-ed and we felt like get-ting up again though day break was yet some way down the fu-ture Yes we be-came very wake-ful so much so that our re-cum-bent po-si-tion be-gan to grow weari-some and by lit-tle and lit-tle we found our-selves sit-ting up the clothes well tucked around us lean-ing again-st the head board with our four knees drawn up close to-geth-er and our two noses bend-ing over them as if our kneep-ans were warm-ing pans We felt very nice and snug the more so since it was so chilly out of doors in-deed out of bed clothes too see-ing that there was no fire in the room The more so I say be-cause tru-ly to en-joy bod-i-ly warmth some small part of you must be cold for there is no qual-i-ty in this world that is not what it is mere-ly by con-trast Noth-ing ex-ists in it-self If you flat-ter your-self that you are all over com-fort-able and have been so a long time then you can-not be said to be com-fort-able any more But if like Quee-queg and me in the bed the tip of your nose or the crown of your head be slight-ly chilled why then in-deed in the gen-er-al con-scious-ness you feel most de-light-ful-ly and un-mis-tak-ably warm For this rea-son a sleep-ing apart-ment should nev-er be fur-nished with a fire which is one of the lux-u-ri-ous dis-com-forts of the rich For the height of this sort of de-li-cious-ness is to have noth-ing but the blan-ket be-tween you and your snug-ness and the cold of the out-er air Then there you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arc-tic crys-tal We had been sit-ting in this crouch-ing man-ner for some time when all at on-ce I thought I would open my eyes for when be-tween sheets whether by day or by night and whether asleep or awake I have a way of al-ways keep-ing my eyes shut in or-der the more to con-cen-trate the snug-ness of be-ing in bed Be-cause no man can ev-er feel his own iden-ti-ty aright ex-cept his eyes be closed as if dark-ness were in-deed the prop-er el-e-ment of our essences though light be more con-ge-nial to our clayey part Upon open-ing my eyes then and com-ing out of my own pleas-ant and self cre-at-ed dark-ness in-to the im-posed and coarse out-er gloom of the unil-lu-mi-nat-ed twelve o clock at night I ex-pe-ri-enced a dis-agree-able re-vul-sion Nor did I at all ob-ject to the hint from Quee-queg that per-haps it were best to strike a light see-ing that we were so wide awake and be-sides he felt a strong de-sire to have a few qui-et puffs from his Tom-a-hawk Be it said that though I had felt such a strong re-pug-nance to his smok-ing in the bed the night be-fore yet see how elas-tic our stiff prej-u-dices grow when love on-ce comes to bend them For now I liked noth-ing bet-ter than to have Quee-queg smok-ing by me even in bed be-cause he seemed to be full of such serene house-hold joy then I no more felt un-du-ly con-cerned for the land-lord s pol-i-cy of in-sur-ance I was on-ly alive to the con-densed con-fi-den-tial com-fort-able-ness of shar-ing a pipe and a blan-ket with a re-al friend With our shag-gy jack-ets drawn about our shoul-ders we now passed the Tom-a-hawk from one to the oth-er till slow-ly there grew over us a blue hang-ing tester of smoke il-lu-mi-nat-ed by the flame of the new lit lamp Whether it was that this un-du-lat-ing tester rolled the sav-age away to far dis-tant sce-nes I know not but he now spoke of his na-tive is-land and ea-ger to hear his his-to-ry I begged him to go on and tell it He glad-ly com-plied Though at the time I but ill com-pre-hend-ed not a few of his words yet sub-se-quent dis-clo-sures when I had be-come more fa-mil-iar with his bro-ken phrase-ol-o-gy now en-able me to pre-sent the whole sto-ry such as it may prove in the mere skele-ton I give CHAPTER 12 Bio-graph-i-cal Quee-queg was a na-tive of Roko-voko an is-land far away to the West and South It is not down in any map true places nev-er are When a new hatched sav-age run-ning wild about his na-tive wood-lands in a grass clout fol-lowed by the nib-bling goats as if he were a green sapling even then in Quee-queg s am-bi-tious soul lurked a strong de-sire to see some-thing more of Chris-ten-dom than a spec-i-men whaler or two His fa-ther was a High Chief a King his un-cle a High Pri-est and on the ma-ter-nal side he boast-ed aun-ts who were the wives of un-con-quer-able war-riors There was ex-cel-lent blood in his vein-s roy-al stuff though sad-ly vi-ti-at-ed I fear by the can-ni-bal propen-si-ty he nour-ished in his un-tu-tored youth A Sag Har-bor ship vis-it-ed his fa-ther s bay and Quee-queg sought a pas-sage to Chris-tian lands But the ship hav-ing her full com-ple-ment of sea-men spurned his suit and not all the King his fa-ther s in-flu-ence could pre-vail But Quee-queg vowed a vow Alone in his ca-noe he pad-dled off to a dis-tant strait which he knew the ship must pass through when she quit-ted the is-land On one side was a coral reef on the oth-er a low tongue of land cov-ered with man-grove thick-ets that grew out in-to the wa-ter Hid-ing his ca-noe still afloat among the-se thick-ets with its prow sea-ward he sat down in the stern pad-dle low in hand and when the ship was glid-ing by like a flash he dart-ed out gained her side with one back-ward dash of his foot cap-sized and sank his ca-noe climbed up the chains and throw-ing him-self at full length up-on the deck grap-pled a ring bolt there and swore not to let it go though hacked in pieces In vain the cap-tain threat-ened to throw him over-board sus-pend-ed a cut-lass over his naked wrists Quee-queg was the son of a King and Quee-queg budged not Struck by his des-per-ate daunt-less-ness and his wild de-sire to vis-it Chris-ten-dom the cap-tain at last re-lent-ed and told him he might make him-self at home But this fine young sav-age this sea Prince of Wales nev-er saw the Cap-tain s cab-in They put him down among the sailors and made a whale-man of him But like Czar Peter con-tent to toil in the ship-yards of for-eign cities Quee-queg dis-dained no seem-ing ig-nominy if there-by he might hap-pi-ly gain the pow-er of en-light-en-ing his un-tu-tored coun-try-men For at bot-tom so he told me he was ac-tu-at-ed by a pro-found de-sire to learn among the Chris-tians the arts where-by to make his peo-ple still hap-pier than they were and more than that still bet-ter than they were But alas the prac-tices of whale-men soon con-vinced him that even Chris-tians could be both mis-er-able and wicked in-finite-ly more so than all his fa-ther s hea-thens Ar-rived at last in old Sag Har-bor and see-ing what the sailors did there and then go-ing on to Nan-tuck-et and see-ing how they spent their wages in that place al-so poor Quee-queg gave it up for lost Thought he it s a wicked world in all merid-i-ans I ll die a pa-gan And thus an old idol-a-tor at heart he yet lived among the-se Chris-tians wore their clothes and tried to talk their gib-ber-ish Hence the queer ways about him though now some time from home By hin-ts I asked him whether he did not pro-pose go-ing back and hav-ing a coro-na-tion since he might now con-sid-er his fa-ther dead and gone he be-ing very old and fee-ble at the last ac-coun-ts He an-swered no not yet and added that he was fear-ful Chris-tian-i-ty or rather Chris-tians had un-fit-ted him for as-cend-ing the pure and un-de-filed throne of thir-ty pa-gan Kings be-fore him But by and by he said he would re-turn  as soon as he felt him-self bap-tized again For the non-ce how-ev-er he pro-posed to sail about and sow his wild oats in all four oceans They had made a har-pooneer of him and that barbed iron was in lieu of a scep-tre now I asked him what might be his im-me-di-ate pur-pose touch-ing his fu-ture move-men-ts He an-swered to go to sea again in his old vo-ca-tion Upon this I told him that whal-ing was my own de-sign and in-formed him of my in-ten-tion to sail out of Nan-tuck-et as be-ing the most promis-ing port for an ad-ven-tur-ous whale-man to em-bark from He at on-ce re-solved to ac-com-pa-ny me to that is-land ship aboard the same ves-sel get in-to the same watch the same boat the same mess with me in short to share my ev-ery hap with both my hands in his bold-ly dip in-to the Potluck of both worlds To all this I joy-ous-ly as-sent-ed for be-sides the af-fec-tion I now felt for Quee-queg he was an ex-pe-ri-enced har-pooneer and as such could not fail to be of great use-ful-ness to one who like me was whol-ly ig-no-rant of the mys-ter-ies of whal-ing though well ac-quaint-ed with the sea as known to mer-chant sea-men His sto-ry be-ing end-ed with his pipe s last dy-ing puff Quee-queg em-braced me pressed his fore-head again-st mine and blow-ing out the light we rolled over from each oth-er this way and that and very soon were sleep-ing CHAPTER 13 Wheel-bar-row Next morn-ing Mon-day af-ter dis-pos-ing of the em-balmed head to a bar-ber for a block I set-tled my own and com-rade s bill us-ing how-ev-er my com-rade s mon-ey The grin-ning land-lord as well as the board-ers seemed amaz-ing-ly tick-led at the sud-den friend-ship which had sprung up be-tween me and Quee-queg es-pe-cial-ly as Peter Coffin s cock and bull sto-ries about him had pre-vi-ous-ly so much alarmed me con-cern-ing the very per-son whom I now com-panied with We bor-rowed a wheel-bar-row and em-bark-ing our things in-clud-ing my own poor car-pet bag and Quee-queg s can-vas sack and ham-mock away we went down to  the Moss  the lit-tle Nan-tuck-et pack-et schooner moored at the wharf As we were go-ing along the peo-ple stared not at Quee-queg so much for they were used to see-ing can-ni-bals like him in their streets  but at see-ing him and me up-on such con-fi-den-tial ter-ms But we heed-ed them not go-ing along wheel-ing the bar-row by turns and Quee-queg now and then stop-ping to ad-just the sheath on his har-poon bar-bs I asked him why he car-ried such a trou-ble-some thing with him ashore and whether all whal-ing ships did not find their own har-poons To this in sub-stance he replied that though what I hint-ed was true enough yet he had a par-tic-u-lar af-fec-tion for his own har-poon be-cause it was of as-sured stuff well tried in many a mor-tal com-bat and deeply in-ti-mate with the hearts of whales In short like many in-land reapers and mow-ers who go in-to the farm-er-s mead-ows armed with their own scythes though in no wise obliged to fur-nish them even so Quee-queg for his own pri-vate rea-sons pre-ferred his own har-poon Shift-ing the bar-row from my hand to his he told me a fun-ny sto-ry about the first wheel-bar-row he had ev-er seen It was in Sag Har-bor The own-ers of his ship it seems had lent him one in which to car-ry his heavy chest to his board-ing house Not to seem ig-no-rant about the thing though in truth he was en-tire-ly so con-cern-ing the pre-cise way in which to man-age the bar-row Quee-queg puts his chest up-on it lash-es it fast and then shoul-ders the bar-row and march-es up the wharf  Why  said I  Quee-queg you might have known bet-ter than that one would think Did-n t the peo-ple laugh  Upon this he told me an-oth-er sto-ry The peo-ple of his is-land of Roko-voko it seems at their wed-ding feasts ex-press the fra-grant wa-ter of young co-coanuts in-to a large stained cal-abash like a punch-bowl and this punch-bowl al-ways for-ms the great cen-tral or-na-ment on the braid-ed mat where the feast is held Now a cer-tain grand mer-chant ship on-ce touched at Roko-voko and its com-man-der from all ac-coun-ts a very state-ly punc-til-ious gen-tle-man at least for a sea cap-tain this com-man-der was in-vit-ed to the wed-ding feast of Quee-queg s sis-ter a pret-ty young princess just turned of ten Well when all the wed-ding guests were as-sem-bled at the bride s bam-boo cot-tage this Cap-tain march-es in and be-ing as-signed the post of hon-or placed him-self over again-st the punch-bowl and be-tween the High Pri-est and his majesty the King Quee-queg s fa-ther Grace be-ing said  for those peo-ple have their grace as well as we though Quee-queg told me that un-like us who at such times look down-wards to our plat-ters they on the con-trary copy-ing the ducks glance up-wards to the great Giver of all feast-s Grace I say be-ing said the High Pri-est opens the ban-quet by the im-memo-ri-al cer-e-mony of the is-land that is dip-ping his con-se-crat-ed and con-se-crat-ing fin-gers in-to the bowl be-fore the blessed bev-er-age cir-cu-lates See-ing him-self placed next the Pri-est and not-ing the cer-e-mony and think-ing him-self be-ing Cap-tain of a ship as hav-ing plain prece-dence over a mere is-land King es-pe-cial-ly in the King s own house the Cap-tain cool-ly pro-ceeds to wash his hands in the punch-bowl  tak-ing it I sup-pose for a huge fin-ger glass  Now  said Quee-queg  what you tink now  Did-n t our peo-ple laugh  At last pas-sage paid and lug-gage safe we stood on board the schooner Hoist-ing sail it glid-ed down the Acush-net river On one side New Bed-ford rose in ter-races of streets their ice cov-ered trees all glit-ter-ing in the clear cold air Huge hills and moun-tains of casks on casks were piled up-on her wharves and side by side the world wan-der-ing whale ships lay silent and safe-ly moored at last while from oth-ers came a sound of car-pen-ters and coop-ers with blend-ed nois-es of fires and forges to melt the pitch all be-to-ken-ing that new cruis-es were on the start that one most per-ilous and long voy-age end-ed on-ly be-gins a sec-ond and a sec-ond end-ed on-ly be-gins a third and so on for ev-er and for aye Such is the end-less-ness yea the in-tol-er-a-ble-ness of all earth-ly ef-fort Gain-ing the more open wa-ter the brac-ing breeze waxed fresh the lit-tle Moss tossed the quick foam from her bows as a young colt his snort-ings How I snuffed that Tar-tar air  how I spurned that turn-pike earth  that com-mon high-way all over dent-ed with the marks of slav-ish heels and hoofs and turned me to ad-mire the mag-na-nim-i-ty of the sea which will per-mit no records At the same foam foun-tain Quee-queg seemed to drink and reel with me His dusky nos-trils swelled apart he showed his filed and point-ed teeth On on we flew and our off-ing gained the Moss did homage to the blast ducked and dived her bows as a slave be-fore the Sul-tan Side-ways lean-ing we side-ways dart-ed ev-ery rope-yarn tin-gling like a wire the two tall mas-ts buck-ling like In-di-an canes in land tor-na-does So full of this reel-ing scene were we as we stood by the plung-ing bowsprit that for some time we did not no-tice the jeer-ing glances of the pas-sen-gers a lub-ber like as-sem-bly who mar-velled that two fel-low be-ings should be so com-pan-ion-able as though a white man were any-thing more dig-ni-fied than a white-washed ne-gro But there were some boo-bies and bump-kins there who by their in-tense green-ness must have come from the heart and cen-tre of all ver-dure Quee-queg caught one of the-se young saplings mim-ick-ing him be-hind his back I thought the bump-kin s hour of doom was come Drop-ping his har-poon the brawny sav-age caught him in his ar-ms and by an al-most mirac-u-lous dex-ter-i-ty and strength sent him high up bod-i-ly in-to the air then slight-ly tap-ping his stern in mid som-er-set the fel-low land-ed with burst-ing lungs up-on his feet while Quee-queg turn-ing his back up-on him light-ed his tom-a-hawk pipe and passed it to me for a puff  Capt-ing Capt-ing  yelled the bump-kin run-ning to-wards that of-fi-cer  Capt-ing Capt-ing here s the dev-il   Hal-lo you sir  cried the Cap-tain a gaunt rib of the sea stalk-ing up to Quee-queg  what in thun-der do you mean by that Don t you know you might have killed that chap   What him say  said Quee-queg as he mild-ly turned to me  He say  said I  that you came near kill e that man there  point-ing to the still shiv-er-ing green-horn  Kill e  cried Quee-queg twist-ing his tat-tooed face in-to an un-earth-ly ex-pres-sion of dis-dain  ah him bevy small e fish e Quee-queg no kill e so small e fish e Quee-queg kill e big whale   Look you  roared the Cap-tain  I ll kill e you you can-ni-bal if you try any more of your tricks aboard here so mind your eye  But it so hap-pened just then that it was high time for the Cap-tain to mind his own eye The prodi-gious strain up-on the main sail had part-ed the weath-er sheet and the tremen-dous boom was now fly-ing from side to side com-plete-ly sweep-ing the en-tire af-ter part of the deck The poor fel-low whom Quee-queg had han-dled so rough-ly was swept over-board all hands were in a pan-ic and to at-tempt snatch-ing at the boom to stay it seemed mad-ness It flew from right to left and back again al-most in one tick-ing of a watch and ev-ery in-stant seemed on the point of snap-ping in-to splin-ters Noth-ing was done and noth-ing seemed ca-pa-ble of be-ing done those on deck rushed to-wards the bows and stood eye-ing the boom as if it were the low-er jaw of an ex-as-per-at-ed whale In the mid-st of this con-ster-na-tion Quee-queg dropped deft-ly to his knees and crawl-ing un-der the path of the boom whipped hold of a rope se-cured one end to the bul-warks and then fling-ing the oth-er like a las-so caught it round the boom as it swept over his head and at the next jerk the spar was that way trapped and all was safe The schooner was run in-to the wind and while the hands were clear-ing away the stern boat Quee-queg stripped to the waist dart-ed from the side with a long liv-ing arc of a leap For three min-utes or more he was seen swim-ming like a dog throw-ing his long ar-ms straight out be-fore him and by turns re-veal-ing his brawny shoul-ders through the freez-ing foam I looked at the grand and glo-ri-ous fel-low but saw no one to be saved The green-horn had gone down Shoot-ing him-self per-pen-dic-u-lar-ly from the wa-ter Quee-queg now took an in-stan-t s glance around him and seem-ing to see just how mat-ters were dived down and dis-ap-peared A few min-utes more and he rose again one arm still strik-ing out and with the oth-er drag-ging a life-less form The boat soon picked them up The poor bump-kin was re-stored All hands vot-ed Quee-queg a no-ble trump the cap-tain begged his par-don From that hour I clove to Quee-queg like a bar-na-cle yea till poor Quee-queg took his last long di-ve Was there ev-er such un-con-scious-ness He did not seem to think that he at all de-served a medal from the Hu-mane and Mag-nan-i-mous So-ci-eties He on-ly asked for wa-ter fresh wa-ter some-thing to wipe the brine off that done he put on dry clothes light-ed his pipe and lean-ing again-st the bul-warks and mild-ly eye-ing those around him seemed to be say-ing to him-self  It s a mu-tu-al joint stock world in all merid-i-ans We can-ni-bals must help the-se Chris-tians  CHAPTER 14 Nan-tuck-et Noth-ing more hap-pened on the pas-sage wor-thy the men-tion-ing so af-ter a fine run we safe-ly ar-rived in Nan-tuck-et Nan-tuck-et Take out your map and look at it See what a re-al cor-ner of the world it oc-cu-pies how it stands there away off shore more lone-ly than the Ed-dy-s-tone light-house Look at it a mere hillock and el-bow of sand all beach with-out a back-ground There is more sand there than you would use in twen-ty years as a sub-sti-tute for blot-ting pa-per Some game-some wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there they don t grow nat-u-ral-ly that they im-port Canada thistles that they have to send be-yond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask that pieces of wood in Nan-tuck-et are car-ried about like bits of the true cross in Rome that peo-ple there plant toad-stools be-fore their hous-es to get un-der the shade in sum-mer time that one blade of grass makes an oa-sis three blades in a day s walk a prair-ie that they wear quick-sand shoes some-thing like La-p-lan-der snow shoes that they are so shut up belt-ed about ev-ery way in-closed sur-round-ed and made an ut-ter is-land of by the ocean that to their very chairs and ta-bles small clams will some-times be found ad-her-ing as to the backs of sea turtles But the-se ex-trav-a-gan-zas on-ly show that Nan-tuck-et is no Illi-nois Look now at the won-drous tra-di-tion-al sto-ry of how this is-land was set-tled by the red men Thus goes the leg-end In old-en times an ea-gle swooped down up-on the New Eng-land coast and car-ried off an in-fant In-di-an in his talons With loud lament the par-en-ts saw their child borne out of sight over the wide wa-ters They re-solved to fol-low in the same di-rec-tion Set-ting out in their ca-noes af-ter a per-ilous pas-sage they dis-cov-ered the is-land and there they found an emp-ty ivory cas-ket  the poor lit-tle In-di-an s skele-ton What won-der then that the-se Nan-tuck-eters born on a beach should take to the sea for a liveli-hood They first caught crabs and quo-hogs in the sand grown bold-er they wad-ed out with nets for mack-erel more ex-pe-ri-enced they pushed off in boats and cap-tured cod and at last launch-ing a navy of great ships on the sea ex-plored this wa-tery world put an in-ces-sant belt of cir-cum-nav-i-ga-tions round it peeped in at Behring s Straits and in all sea-sons and all oceans de-clared ev-er-last-ing war with the might-i-est an-i-mat-ed mass that has sur-vived the flood most mon-strous and most moun-tain-ous That Him-male-han salt sea Mastodon clothed with such por-ten-tous-ness of un-con-scious pow-er that his very pan-ics are more to be dread-ed than his most fear-less and ma-li-cious as-saults And thus have the-se naked Nan-tuck-eters the-se sea her-mits is-su-ing from their ant hill in the sea over-run and con-quered the wa-tery world like so many Alexan-ders par-celling out among them the At-lantic Paci-fic and In-di-an oceans as the three pi-rate pow-ers did Poland Let Amer-i-ca add Mex-i-co to Tex-as and pile Cuba up-on Canada let the English over-swarm all In-dia and hang out their blaz-ing ban-ner from the sun two thirds of this ter-raque-ous globe are the Nan-tuck-eter s For the sea is his he owns it as Em-per-ors own em-pires oth-er sea-men hav-ing but a right of way through it Mer-chant ships are but ex-ten-sion bridges armed ones but float-ing forts even pi-rates and pri-va-teers though fol-low-ing the sea as high-way-men the road they but plun-der oth-er ships oth-er frag-men-ts of the land like them-selves with-out seek-ing to draw their liv-ing from the bot-tom-less deep it-self The Nan-tuck-eter he alone re-sides and ri-ots on the sea he alone in Bi-ble lan-guage goes down to it in ships to and fro plough-ing it as his own spe-cial plan-ta-tion There is his home there lies his busi-ness which a Noah s flood would not in-ter-rupt though it over-whelmed all the mil-lions in Chi-na He lives on the sea as prair-ie cocks in the prair-ie he hides among the waves he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the Alps For years he knows not the land so that when he comes to it at last it smells like an-oth-er world more strange-ly than the moon would to an Earths-man With the land-less gull that at sun-set folds her wings and is rocked to sleep be-tween bil-lows so at night-fall the Nan-tuck-eter out of sight of land furls his sails and lays him to his rest while un-der his very pil-low rush herds of wal-rus-es and whales CHAPTER 15 Chow-der It was quite late in the evening when the lit-tle Moss came snug-ly to an-chor and Quee-queg and I went ashore so we could at-tend to no busi-ness that day at least none but a sup-per and a bed The land-lord of the Spouter Inn had rec-om-mend-ed us to his cous-in Hosea Hussey of the Try Pots whom he as-sert-ed to be the pro-pri-etor of one of the best kept ho-tels in all Nan-tuck-et and more-over he had as-sured us that Cous-in Hosea as he called him was fa-mous for his chow-ders In short he plain-ly hint-ed that we could not pos-si-bly do bet-ter than try pot luck at the Try Pots But the di-rec-tions he had given us about keep-ing a yel-low ware-house on our star-board hand till we opened a white church to the lar-board and then keep-ing that on the lar-board hand till we made a cor-ner three points to the star-board and that done then ask the first man we met where the place was the-se crooked di-rec-tions of his very much puz-zled us at first es-pe-cial-ly as at the out-set Quee-queg in-sist-ed that the yel-low ware-house our first point of de-par-ture must be left on the lar-board hand where-as I had un-der-stood Peter Coffin to say it was on the star-board How-ev-er by dint of beat-ing about a lit-tle in the dark and now and then knock-ing up a peace-able in-hab-i-tant to in-quire the way we at last came to some-thing which there was no mis-tak-ing Two enor-mous wood-en pots paint-ed black and sus-pend-ed by as-s-es ears swung from the cross trees of an old top mast plant-ed in front of an old door-way The horns of the cross trees were sawed off on the oth-er side so that this old top mast looked not a lit-tle like a gal-lows Per-haps I was over sen-si-tive to such im-pres-sions at the time but I could not help star-ing at this gal-lows with a vague mis-giv-ing A sort of crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two re-main-ing horns yes two of them one for Quee-queg and one for me It s omi-nous thinks I A Coffin my Innkeep-er up-on land-ing in my first whal-ing port tomb-stones star-ing at me in the whale-men s chapel and here a gal-lows and a pair of prodi-gious black pots too Are the-se last throw-ing out oblique hin-ts touch-ing Tophet I was called from the-se re-flec-tions by the sight of a freck-led wom-an with yel-low hair and a yel-low gown stand-ing in the porch of the inn un-der a dull red lamp swing-ing there that looked much like an in-jured eye and car-ry-ing on a brisk scold-ing with a man in a pur-ple wool-len shirt  Get along with ye  said she to the man  or I ll be comb-ing ye   Come on Quee-queg  said I  all right There s Mrs Hussey  And so it turned out Mr Hosea Hussey be-ing from home but leav-ing Mrs Hussey en-tire-ly com-pe-tent to at-tend to all his af-fairs Upon mak-ing known our de-sires for a sup-per and a bed Mrs Hussey post-pon-ing fur-ther scold-ing for the pre-sent ush-ered us in-to a lit-tle room and seat-ing us at a table spread with the relics of a re-cent-ly con-clud-ed repast turned round to us and said  Clam or Cod   What s that about Cods ma am  said I with much po-lite-ness  Clam or Cod  she re-peat-ed  A clam for sup-per a cold clam is that what you mean Mrs Hussey  says I  but that s a rather cold and clam-my re-cep-tion in the win-ter time ain t it Mrs Hussey  But be-ing in a great hur-ry to re-sume scold-ing the man in the pur-ple Shirt who was wait-ing for it in the en-try and seem-ing to hear noth-ing but the word  clam  Mrs Hussey hur-ried to-wards an open door lead-ing to the kitchen and bawl-ing out  clam for two  dis-ap-peared  Quee-queg  said I  do you think that we can make out a sup-per for us both on one clam  How-ev-er a warm sa-vory steam from the kitchen served to be-lie the ap-par-ent-ly cheer-less prospect be-fore us But when that smok-ing chow-der came in the mys-tery was de-light-ful-ly ex-plained Oh sweet friends hear-ken to me It was made of small juicy clams scarce-ly big-ger than hazel nuts mixed with pound-ed ship bis-cuit and salt-ed pork cut up in-to lit-tle flakes the whole en-riched with but-ter and plen-ti-ful-ly sea-soned with pep-per and salt Our ap-petites be-ing sharp-ened by the frosty voy-age and in par-tic-u-lar Quee-queg see-ing his favourite fish-ing food be-fore him and the chow-der be-ing sur-pass-ing-ly ex-cel-lent we despatched it with great ex-pe-di-tion when lean-ing back a mo-ment and be-think-ing me of Mrs Hussey s clam and cod an-nounce-ment I thought I would try a lit-tle ex-per-i-ment Step-ping to the kitchen door I ut-tered the word  cod with great em-pha-sis and re-sumed my seat In a few mo-men-ts the savoury steam came forth again but with a dif-fer-ent fla-vor and in good time a fine cod chow-der was placed be-fore us We re-sumed busi-ness and while ply-ing our spoons in the bowl thinks I to my-self I won-der now if this here has any ef-fect on the head What s that stul-ti-fy-ing say-ing about chow-der head-ed peo-ple  But look Quee-queg ain t that a live eel in your bowl Where s your har-poon  Fishi-est of all fishy places was the Try Pots which well de-served its name for the pots there were al-ways boil-ing chow-ders Chow-der for break-fast and chow-der for din-ner and chow-der for sup-per till you be-gan to look for fish bones com-ing through your clothes The area be-fore the house was paved with clam shel-ls Mrs Hussey wore a pol-ished neck-lace of cod-fish ver-te-bra and Hosea Hussey had his ac-count books bound in su-pe-ri-or old shark skin There was a fishy fla-vor to the milk too which I could not at all ac-count for till one morn-ing hap-pen-ing to take a stroll along the beach among some fish-er-men s boats I saw Hosea s brindled cow feed-ing on fish rem-nan-ts and march-ing along the sand with each foot in a cod s de-cap-i-tat-ed head look-ing very slip shod I as-sure ye Sup-per con-clud-ed we re-ceived a lamp and di-rec-tions from Mrs Hussey con-cern-ing the near-est way to bed but as Quee-queg was about to pre-cede me up the stairs the la-dy reached forth her arm and de-mand-ed his har-poon she al-lowed no har-poon in her cham-bers  Why not  said I  ev-ery true whale-man sleeps with his har-poon but why not   Be-cause it s dan-ger-ous  says she  Ever since young Stig-gs com-ing from that un-fort nt v y ge of his when he was gone four years and a half with on-ly three bar-rels of ile was found dead in my first floor back with his har-poon in his side ev-er since then I al-low no board-ers to take sich dan-ger-ous weep-ons in their rooms at night So Mr Quee-queg for she had learned his name  I will just take this here iron and keep it for you till morn-ing But the chow-der clam or cod to mor-row for break-fast men   Both  says I  and let s have a cou-ple of smoked her-ring by way of va-ri-ety  CHAPTER 16 The Ship In bed we con-coct-ed our plans for the mor-row But to my sur-prise and no small con-cern Quee-queg now gave me to un-der-stand that he had been dili-gent-ly con-sult-ing Yo-jo the name of his black lit-tle god and Yo-jo had told him two or three times over and strong-ly in-sist-ed up-on it ev-ery-way that in-stead of our go-ing to-geth-er among the whal-ing fleet in har-bor and in con-cert se-lect-ing our craft in-stead of this I say Yo-jo earnest-ly en-joined that the se-lec-tion of the ship should rest whol-ly with me inas-much as Yo-jo pur-posed be-friend-ing us and in or-der to do so had al-ready pitched up-on a ves-sel which if left to my-self I Ish-mael should in-fal-li-bly light up-on for all the world as though it had turned out by chance and in that ves-sel I must im-me-di-ate-ly ship my-self for the pre-sent ir-re-spec-tive of Quee-queg I have for-got-ten to men-tion that in many things Quee-queg placed great con-fi-dence in the ex-cel-lence of Yo-jo s judg-ment and sur-pris-ing fore-cast of things and cher-ished Yo-jo with con-sid-er-able es-teem as a rather good sort of god who per-haps meant well enough up-on the whole but in all cas-es did not suc-ceed in his benev-o-lent de-signs Now this plan of Quee-queg s or rather Yo-jo s touch-ing the se-lec-tion of our craft I did not like that plan at all I had not a lit-tle re-lied up-on Quee-queg s sagac-i-ty to point out the whaler best fit-ted to car-ry us and our for-tunes se-cure-ly But as all my re-mon-strances pro-duced no ef-fect up-on Quee-queg I was obliged to ac-qui-esce and ac-cord-ing-ly pre-pared to set about this busi-ness with a de-ter-mined rush-ing sort of en-er-gy and vig-or that should quick-ly set-tle that tri-fling lit-tle af-fair Next morn-ing ear-ly leav-ing Quee-queg shut up with Yo-jo in our lit-tle bed-room for it seemed that it was some sort of Lent or Ra-madan or day of fast-ing hu-mil-i-a-tion and prayer with Quee-queg and Yo-jo that day how it was I nev-er could find out for though I ap-plied my-self to it sev-er-al times I nev-er could mas-ter his liturgies and XXXIX Ar-ti-cles leav-ing Quee-queg then fast-ing on his tom-a-hawk pipe and Yo-jo warm-ing him-self at his sac-ri-fi-cial fire of shav-ings I sal-lied out among the ship-ping After much pro-longed saun-ter-ing and many ran-dom in-quiries I learnt that there were three ships up for three years voy-ages The Devil dam the Tit bit and the Pe-quod Devil Dam I do not know the orig-in of Tit bit is ob-vi-ous Pe-quod you will no doubt re-mem-ber was the name of a cel-e-brat-ed tribe of Mas-sachuset-ts In-di-ans now ex-tinct as the an-cient Medes I peered and pryed about the Devil dam from her hopped over to the Tit bit and fi-nal-ly go-ing on board the Pe-quod looked around her for a mo-ment and then de-cid-ed that this was the very ship for us You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day for aught I know  square toed lug-gers moun-tain-ous Ja-pane-se junks but-ter box gal-liots and what not but take my word for it you nev-er saw such a rare old craft as this same rare old Pe-quod She was a ship of the old school rather small if any-thing with an old fash-ioned claw foot-ed look about her Long sea-soned and weath-er stained in the ty-phoons and calms of all four oceans her old hul-l s com-plex-ion was dark-ened like a French grenadier s who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia Her ven-er-a-ble bows looked beard-ed Her mast-s cut some-where on the coast of Ja-pan where her orig-i-nal ones were lost over-board in a gale her mas-ts stood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of Cologne Her an-cient decks were worn and wrin-kled like the pil-grim wor-shipped flag stone in Can-ter-bury Cathe-dral where Beck-et bled But to all the-se her old an-tiq-ui-ties were added new and mar-vel-lous fea-tures per-tain-ing to the wild busi-ness that for more than half a cen-tu-ry she had fol-lowed Old Cap-tain Peleg many years her chief mate be-fore he com-mand-ed an-oth-er ves-sel of his own and now a re-tired sea-man and one of the prin-ci-pal own-ers of the Pe-quod  this old Peleg dur-ing the term of his chief mate-ship had built up-on her orig-i-nal grotesque-ness and in-laid it all over with a quaint-ness both of ma-te-ri-al and de-vice un-matched by any-thing ex-cept it be Thorkill Hake s carved buck-ler or bed-stead She was ap-par-elled like any bar-bar-ic Ethiopi-an em-per-or his neck heavy with pen-dan-ts of pol-ished ivory She was a thing of tro-phies A can-ni-bal of a craft trick-ing her-self forth in the chased bones of her en-e-mies All round her un-pan-elled open bul-warks were gar-nished like one con-tin-u-ous jaw with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale in-sert-ed there for pins to fas-ten her old hempen thews and ten-dons to Those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood but deft-ly trav-elled over sheaves of sea ivory Scorn-ing a turn-stile wheel at her rev-erend helm she sport-ed there a tiller and that tiller was in one mass cu-ri-ous-ly carved from the long nar-row low-er jaw of her hered-i-tary foe The helms-man who steered by that tiller in a tem-pest felt like the Tar-tar when he holds back his fiery steed by clutch-ing its jaw A no-ble craft but some-how a most melan-choly All no-ble things are touched with that Now when I looked about the quar-ter deck for some one hav-ing au-thor-i-ty in or-der to pro-pose my-self as a can-di-date for the voy-age at first I saw no-body but I could not well over-look a strange sort of tent or rather wig-wam pitched a lit-tle be-hind the main mast It seemed on-ly a tem-po-rary erec-tion used in port It was of a con-i-cal shape some ten feet high con-sist-ing of the long huge slabs of lim-ber black bone tak-en from the mid-dle and high-est part of the jaws of the right whale Plant-ed with their broad ends on the deck a cir-cle of the-se slabs laced to-geth-er mu-tu-al-ly sloped to-wards each oth-er and at the apex unit-ed in a tuft-ed point where the loose hairy fi-bres waved to and fro like the top knot on some old Pot-towot-tamie Sachem s head A tri-an-gu-lar open-ing faced to-wards the bows of the ship so that the in-sid-er com-mand-ed a com-plete view for-ward And half con-cealed in this queer ten-e-ment I at length found one who by his as-pect seemed to have au-thor-i-ty and who it be-ing noon and the ship s work sus-pend-ed was now en-joy-ing respite from the bur-den of com-mand He was seat-ed on an old fash-ioned oak-en chair wrig-gling all over with cu-ri-ous carv-ing and the bot-tom of which was formed of a stout in-ter-lac-ing of the same elas-tic stuff of which the wig-wam was con-struct-ed There was noth-ing so very par-tic-u-lar per-haps about the ap-pear-ance of the el-der-ly man I saw he was brown and brawny like most old sea-men and heav-i-ly rolled up in blue pi-lot cloth cut in the Quak-er style on-ly there was a fine and al-most mi-cro-scop-ic net work of the min-utest wrin-kles in-ter-lac-ing round his eyes which must have arisen from his con-tin-u-al sail-ings in many hard gales and al-ways look-ing to wind-ward  for this caus-es the mus-cles about the eyes to be-come pursed to-geth-er Such eye wrin-kles are very ef-fec-tu-al in a scowl  Is this the Cap-tain of the Pe-quod  said I ad-vanc-ing to the door of the tent  Sup-pos-ing it be the cap-tain of the Pe-quod what dost thou want of him  he de-mand-ed  I was think-ing of ship-ping   Thou wast wast thou I see thou art no Nan-tuck-eter ev-er been in a stove boat   No Sir I nev-er have   Dost know noth-ing at all about whal-ing I dare say eh  Noth-ing Sir but I have no doubt I shall soon learn I ve been sev-er-al voy-ages in the mer-chant ser-vice and I think that   Mer-chant ser-vice be damned Talk not that lin-go to me Dost see that leg  I ll take that leg away from thy stern if ev-er thou talkest of the marchant ser-vice to me again Marchant ser-vice in-deed I sup-pose now ye feel con-sid-er-able proud of hav-ing served in those marchant ships But flukes man what makes thee want to go a whal-ing eh  it looks a lit-tle sus-pi-cious don t it eh  Hast not been a pi-rate hast thou  Did-st not rob thy last Cap-tain did-st thou  Dost not think of mur-der-ing the of-fi-cers when thou gettest to sea  I protest-ed my in-no-cence of the-se things I saw that un-der the mask of the-se half hu-mor-ous in-nu-en-does this old sea-man as an in-su-lat-ed Quak-er-ish Nan-tuck-eter was full of his in-su-lar prej-u-dices and rather dis-trust-ful of all aliens un-less they hailed from Cape Cod or the Vine-yard  But what takes thee a whal-ing I want to know that be-fore I think of ship-ping ye   Well sir I want to see what whal-ing is I want to see the world   Want to see what whal-ing is eh Have ye clapped eye on Cap-tain Ahab   Who is Cap-tain Ahab sir   Aye aye I thought so Cap-tain Ahab is the Cap-tain of this ship   I am mis-tak-en then I thought I was speak-ing to the Cap-tain him-self   Thou art speak-ing to Cap-tain Peleg that s who ye are speak-ing to young man It be-longs to me and Cap-tain Bil-dad to see the Pe-quod fit-ted out for the voy-age and sup-plied with all her needs in-clud-ing crew We are part own-ers and agen-ts But as I was go-ing to say if thou wan-test to know what whal-ing is as thou tellest ye do I can put ye in a way of find-ing it out be-fore ye bind your-self to it past back-ing out Clap eye on Cap-tain Ahab young man and thou wilt find that he has on-ly one leg   What do you mean sir Was the oth-er one lost by a whale   Lost by a whale Young man come nearer to me it was de-voured chewed up crunched by the mon-strous-est par-ma-cetty that ev-er chipped a boat  ah ah  I was a lit-tle alarmed by his en-er-gy per-haps al-so a lit-tle touched at the hearty grief in his con-clud-ing ex-cla-ma-tion but said as calm-ly as I could  What you say is no doubt true enough sir but how could I know there was any pe-cu-liar fe-roc-i-ty in that par-tic-u-lar whale though in-deed I might have in-ferred as much from the sim-ple fact of the ac-ci-dent   Look ye now young man thy lungs are a sort of soft d ye see thou dost not talk shark a bit Sure ye ve been to sea be-fore now sure of that   Sir  said I  I thought I told you that I had been four voy-ages in the mer-chan-t   Hard down out of that Mind what I said about the marchant ser-vice don t ag-gra-vate me I won t have it But let us un-der-stand each oth-er I have given thee a hint about what whal-ing is do ye yet feel in-clined for it   I do sir   Very good Now art thou the man to pitch a har-poon down a live whale s throat and then jump af-ter it An-swer quick   I am sir if it should be pos-i-tive-ly in-dis-pens-able to do so not to be got rid of that is which I don t take to be the fact   Good again Now then thou not on-ly wan-test to go a whal-ing to find out by ex-pe-ri-ence what whal-ing is but ye al-so want to go in or-der to see the world Was not that what ye said I thought so Well then just step for-ward there and take a peep over the weath-er bow and then back to me and tell me what ye see there  For a mo-ment I stood a lit-tle puz-zled by this cu-ri-ous re-quest not know-ing ex-act-ly how to take it whether hu-mor-ous-ly or in earnest But con-cen-trat-ing all his crow s feet in-to one scowl Cap-tain Peleg start-ed me on the er-rand Go-ing for-ward and glanc-ing over the weath-er bow I per-ceived that the ship swing-ing to her an-chor with the flood tide was now oblique-ly point-ing to-wards the open ocean The prospect was un-lim-it-ed but ex-ceed-ing-ly monotonous and for-bid-ding not the slight-est va-ri-ety that I could see  Well what s the re-port  said Peleg when I came back  what did ye see   Not much  I replied  noth-ing but wa-ter con-sid-er-able hori-zon though and there s a squall com-ing up I think   Well what does thou think then of see-ing the world Do ye wish to go round Cape Horn to see any more of it eh Can t ye see the world where you stand  I was a lit-tle stag-gered but go a whal-ing I must and I would and the Pe-quod was as good a ship as any I thought the best and all this I now re-peat-ed to Peleg See-ing me so de-ter-mined he ex-pressed his will-ing-ness to ship me  And thou mayest as well sign the pa-pers right off  he added  come along with ye  And so say-ing he led the way be-low deck in-to the cab-in Seat-ed on the tran-som was what seemed to me a most un-com-mon and sur-pris-ing fig-ure It turned out to be Cap-tain Bil-dad who along with Cap-tain Peleg was one of the largest own-ers of the ves-sel the oth-er shares as is some-times the case in the-se ports be-ing held by a crowd of old an-nu-i-tan-ts wid-ows fa-ther-less chil-dren and chancery wards each own-ing about the val-ue of a tim-ber head or a foot of plank or a nail or two in the ship Peo-ple in Nan-tuck-et in-vest their mon-ey in whal-ing ves-sels the same way that you do yours in ap-proved state stocks bring-ing in good in-ter-est Now Bil-dad like Peleg and in-deed many oth-er Nan-tuck-eters was a Quak-er the is-land hav-ing been orig-i-nal-ly set-tled by that sect and to this day its in-hab-i-tan-ts in gen-er-al re-tain in an un-com-mon mea-sure the pe-cu-liar-i-ties of the Quak-er on-ly var-i-ous-ly and anoma-lous-ly mod-i-fied by things al-to-geth-er alien and het-ero-ge-neous For some of the-se same Quak-ers are the most san-guinary of all sailors and whale hunters They are fight-ing Quak-ers they are Quak-ers with a vengeance So that there are in-stances among them of men who named with Scrip-ture names a sin-gu-lar-ly com-mon fash-ion on the is-land and in child-hood nat-u-ral-ly im-bib-ing the state-ly dra-mat-ic thee and thou of the Quak-er id-iom still from the au-da-cious dar-ing and bound-less ad-ven-ture of their sub-se-quent lives strange-ly blend with the-se un-out-grown pe-cu-liar-i-ties a thou-sand bold dash-es of char-ac-ter not un-wor-thy a Scan-di-na-vian sea king or a po-et-i-cal Pa-gan Ro-man And when the-se things unite in a man of great-ly su-pe-ri-or nat-u-ral force with a glob-u-lar brain and a pon-der-ous heart who has al-so by the still-ness and seclu-sion of many long night watch-es in the re-motest wa-ters and be-neath con-stel-la-tions nev-er seen here at the north been led to think un-tra-di-tion-al-ly and in-de-pen-dent-ly re-ceiv-ing all na-ture s sweet or sav-age im-pres-sions fresh from her own vir-gin vol-un-tary and con-fid-ing breast and there-by chiefly but with some help from ac-ci-den-tal ad-van-tages to learn a bold and ner-vous lofty lan-guage that man makes one in a whole na-tion s cen-sus a mighty pageant crea-ture formed for no-ble tragedies Nor will it at all de-tract from him dra-mat-i-cal-ly re-gard-ed if ei-ther by birth or oth-er cir-cum-stances he have what seems a half wil-ful over-rul-ing mor-bid-ness at the bot-tom of his na-ture For all men trag-i-cal-ly great are made so through a cer-tain mor-bid-ness Be sure of this O young am-bi-tion all mor-tal great-ness is but dis-ease But as yet we have not to do with such an one but with quite an-oth-er and still a man who if in-deed pe-cu-liar it on-ly re-sults again from an-oth-er phase of the Quak-er mod-i-fied by in-di-vid-u-al cir-cum-stances Like Cap-tain Peleg Cap-tain Bil-dad was a well to do re-tired whale-man But un-like Cap-tain Peleg who cared not a rush for what are called se-ri-ous things and in-deed deemed those self same se-ri-ous things the ver-i-est of all tri-fles Cap-tain Bil-dad had not on-ly been orig-i-nal-ly ed-u-cat-ed ac-cord-ing to the strictest sect of Nan-tuck-et Quak-erism but all his sub-se-quent ocean life and the sight of many un-clad love-ly is-land crea-tures round the Horn all that had not moved this na-tive born Quak-er one sin-gle jot had not so much as al-tered one an-gle of his vest Still for all this im-mutable-ness was there some lack of com-mon con-sis-ten-cy about wor-thy Cap-tain Bil-dad Though re-fus-ing from con-sci-en-tious scru-ples to bear ar-ms again-st land in-vaders yet him-self had il-lim-itably in-vad-ed the At-lantic and Paci-fic and though a sworn foe to hu-man blood-shed yet had he in his straight bod-ied coat spilled tuns up-on tuns of leviathan gore How now in the con-tem-pla-tive evening of his days the pi-ous Bil-dad rec-on-ciled the-se things in the rem-i-nis-cence I do not know but it did not seem to con-cern him much and very prob-a-bly he had long since come to the sage and sen-si-ble con-clu-sion that a man s re-li-gion is one thing and this prac-ti-cal world quite an-oth-er This world pays div-i-dends Ris-ing from a lit-tle cab-in boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab to a har-pooneer in a broad shad bel-lied waist-coat from that be-com-ing boat head-er chief mate and cap-tain and fi-nal-ly a ship own-er Bil-dad as I hint-ed be-fore had con-clud-ed his ad-ven-tur-ous ca-reer by whol-ly re-tir-ing from ac-tive life at the good-ly age of six-ty and ded-i-cat-ing his re-main-ing days to the qui-et re-ceiv-ing of his well earned in-come Now Bil-dad I am sor-ry to say had the rep-u-ta-tion of be-ing an in-cor-ri-gi-ble old hunks and in his sea go-ing days a bit-ter hard task mas-ter They told me in Nan-tuck-et though it cer-tain-ly seems a cu-ri-ous sto-ry that when he sailed the old Categut whale-man his crew up-on ar-riv-ing home were most-ly all car-ried ashore to the hos-pi-tal sore ex-haust-ed and worn out For a pi-ous man es-pe-cial-ly for a Quak-er he was cer-tain-ly rather hard heart-ed to say the least He nev-er used to swear though at his men they said but some-how he got an in-or-di-nate quan-ti-ty of cru-el un-mit-i-gat-ed hard work out of them When Bil-dad was a chief mate to have his drab coloured eye in-tent-ly look-ing at you made you feel com-plete-ly ner-vous till you could clutch some-thing a ham-mer or a mar-ling spike and go to work like mad at some-thing or oth-er nev-er mind what In-do-lence and idle-ness per-ished be-fore him His own per-son was the ex-act em-bod-i-ment of his util-i-tar-i-an char-ac-ter On his long gaunt body he car-ried no spare flesh no su-per-flu-ous beard his chin hav-ing a soft eco-nom-i-cal nap to it like the worn nap of his broad brimmed hat Such then was the per-son that I saw seat-ed on the tran-som when I fol-lowed Cap-tain Peleg down in-to the cab-in The space be-tween the decks was small and there bolt up-right sat old Bil-dad who al-ways sat so and nev-er leaned and this to save his coat tails His broad brim was placed beside him his legs were stiffly crossed his drab ves-ture was but-toned up to his chin and spec-ta-cles on nose he seemed ab-sorbed in read-ing from a pon-der-ous vol-ume  Bil-dad  cried Cap-tain Peleg  at it again Bil-dad eh Ye have been study-ing those Scrip-tures now for the last thir-ty years to my cer-tain knowl-edge How far ye got Bil-dad  As if long ha-bit-u-at-ed to such pro-fane talk from his old ship-mate Bil-dad with-out notic-ing his pre-sent ir-rev-er-ence qui-et-ly looked up and see-ing me glanced again in-quir-ing-ly to-wards Peleg  He says he s our man Bil-dad  said Peleg  he wan-ts to ship   Dost thee  said Bil-dad in a hol-low tone and turn-ing round to me  I dost  said I un-con-scious-ly he was so in-tense a Quak-er  What do ye think of him Bil-dad  said Peleg  He ll do  said Bil-dad eye-ing me and then went on spelling away at his book in a mum-bling tone quite au-di-ble I thought him the queer-est old Quak-er I ev-er saw es-pe-cial-ly as Peleg his friend and old ship-mate seemed such a blus-terer But I said noth-ing on-ly look-ing round me sharply Peleg now threw open a chest and draw-ing forth the ship s ar-ti-cles placed pen and ink be-fore him and seat-ed him-self at a lit-tle table I be-gan to think it was high time to set-tle with my-self at what ter-ms I would be will-ing to en-gage for the voy-age I was al-ready aware that in the whal-ing busi-ness they paid no wages but all hands in-clud-ing the cap-tain re-ceived cer-tain shares of the prof-its called lays and that the-se lays were pro-por-tioned to the de-gree of im-por-tance per-tain-ing to the re-spec-tive du-ties of the ship s com-pa-ny I was al-so aware that be-ing a green hand at whal-ing my own lay would not be very large but con-sid-er-ing that I was used to the sea could steer a ship splice a rope and all that I made no doubt that from all I had heard I should be of-fered at least the 275th lay that is the 275th part of the clear net pro-ceeds of the voy-age what-ev-er that might even-tu-al-ly amount to And though the 275th lay was what they call a rather long lay yet it was bet-ter than noth-ing and if we had a lucky voy-age might pret-ty near-ly pay for the cloth-ing I would wear out on it not to speak of my three years beef and board for which I would not have to pay one stiver It might be thought that this was a poor way to ac-cu-mu-late a prince-ly for-tune and so it was a very poor way in-deed But I am one of those that nev-er take on about prince-ly for-tunes and am quite con-tent if the world is ready to board and lodge me while I am putting up at this grim sign of the Thun-der Cloud Upon the whole I thought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing but would not have been sur-prised had I been of-fered the 2th con-sid-er-ing I was of a broad shoul-dered make But one thing nev-er-the-less that made me a lit-tle dis-trust-ful about re-ceiv-ing a gen-er-ous share of the prof-its was this Ashore I had heard some-thing of both Cap-tain Peleg and his un-ac-count-able old crony Bil-dad how that they be-ing the prin-ci-pal pro-pri-etors of the Pe-quod there-fore the oth-er and more in-con-sid-er-able and scat-tered own-ers left near-ly the whole man-age-ment of the ship s af-fairs to the-se two And I did not know but what the stingy old Bil-dad might have a mighty deal to say about ship-ping hands es-pe-cial-ly as I now found him on board the Pe-quod quite at home there in the cab-in and read-ing his Bi-ble as if at his own fireside Now while Peleg was vain-ly try-ing to mend a pen with his jack knife old Bil-dad to my no small sur-prise con-sid-er-ing that he was such an in-ter-est-ed par-ty in the-se pro-ceed-ings Bil-dad nev-er heed-ed us but went on mum-bling to him-self out of his book  Lay not up for your-selves trea-sures up-on earth where moth   Well Cap-tain Bil-dad  in-ter-rupt-ed Peleg  what d ye say what lay shall we give this young man   Thou know-est best  was the sepul-chral re-ply  the sev-en hun-dred and sev-en-ty sev-en-th would-n t be too much would it   where moth and rust do cor-rupt but lay    Lay in-deed thought I and such a lay the sev-en hun-dred and sev-en-ty sev-en-th Well old Bil-dad you are de-ter-mined that I for one shall not lay up many lays here be-low where moth and rust do cor-rupt It was an ex-ceed-ing-ly long lay that in-deed and though from the mag-ni-tude of the fig-ure it might at first de-ceive a lands-man yet the slight-est con-sid-er-a-tion will show that though sev-en hun-dred and sev-en-ty sev-en is a pret-ty large num-ber yet when you come to make a teen-th of it you will then see I say that the sev-en hun-dred and sev-en-ty sev-en-th part of a far-thing is a good deal less than sev-en hun-dred and sev-en-ty sev-en gold dou-bloons and so I thought at the time  Why blast your eyes Bil-dad  cried Peleg  thou dost not want to swindle this young man he must have more than that   Seven hun-dred and sev-en-ty sev-en-th  again said Bil-dad with-out lift-ing his eyes and then went on mum-bling  for where your trea-sure is there will your heart be al-so   I am go-ing to put him down for the three hun-dredth  said Peleg  do ye hear that Bil-dad The three hun-dredth lay I say  Bil-dad laid down his book and turn-ing solemn-ly to-wards him said  Cap-tain Peleg thou hast a gen-er-ous heart but thou must con-sid-er the du-ty thou ow-est to the oth-er own-ers of this ship wid-ows and or-phans many of them and that if we too abun-dant-ly re-ward the labors of this young man we may be tak-ing the bread from those wid-ows and those or-phans The sev-en hun-dred and sev-en-ty sev-en-th lay Cap-tain Peleg   Thou Bil-dad  roared Peleg start-ing up and clat-ter-ing about the cab-in  Blast ye Cap-tain Bil-dad if I had fol-lowed thy ad-vice in the-se mat-ters I would afore now had a con-science to lug about that would be heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ev-er sailed round Cape Horn   Cap-tain Peleg  said Bil-dad steadi-ly  thy con-science may be draw-ing ten inch-es of wa-ter or ten fath-oms I can t tell but as thou art still an im-pen-i-tent man Cap-tain Peleg I great-ly fear lest thy con-science be but a leaky one and will in the end sink thee founder-ing down to the fiery pit Cap-tain Peleg   Fiery pit fiery pit ye in-sult me man past all nat-u-ral bear-ing ye in-sult me It s an all fired out-rage to tell any hu-man crea-ture that he s bound to hell Flukes and flames Bil-dad say that again to me and start my soul bolts but I ll I ll yes I ll swal-low a live goat with all his hair and horns on Out of the cab-in ye cant-ing drab coloured son of a wood-en gun a straight wake with ye  As he thun-dered out this he made a rush at Bil-dad but with a mar-vel-lous oblique slid-ing celer-i-ty Bil-dad for that time elud-ed him Alarmed at this ter-ri-ble out-burst be-tween the two prin-ci-pal and re-spon-si-ble own-ers of the ship and feel-ing half a mind to give up all idea of sail-ing in a ves-sel so ques-tion-ably owned and tem-porar-i-ly com-mand-ed I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bil-dad who I made no doubt was all ea-ger-ness to van-ish from be-fore the awak-ened wrath of Peleg But to my as-ton-ish-ment he sat down again on the tran-som very qui-et-ly and seemed to have not the slight-est in-ten-tion of with-draw-ing He seemed quite used to im-pen-i-tent Peleg and his ways As for Peleg af-ter let-ting off his rage as he had there seemed no more left in him and he too sat down like a lamb though he twitched a lit-tle as if still ner-vous-ly ag-i-tat-ed  Whew  he whis-tled at last  the squall s gone off to lee-ward I think Bil-dad thou used to be good at sharp-en-ing a lance mend that pen will ye My jack knife here needs the grind-stone That s he thank ye Bil-dad Now then my young man Ish-mael s thy name did-n t ye say Well then down ye go here Ish-mael for the three hun-dredth lay   Cap-tain Peleg  said I  I have a friend with me who wan-ts to ship too shall I bring him down to mor-row   To be sure  said Peleg  Fetch him along and we ll look at him   What lay does he want  groaned Bil-dad glanc-ing up from the book in which he had again been bury-ing him-self  Oh nev-er thee mind about that Bil-dad  said Peleg  Has he ev-er whaled it any  turn-ing to me  Killed more whales than I can count Cap-tain Peleg   Well bring him along then  And af-ter sign-ing the pa-pers off I went noth-ing doubt-ing but that I had done a good morn-ing s work and that the Pe-quod was the iden-ti-cal ship that Yo-jo had pro-vid-ed to car-ry Quee-queg and me round the Cape But I had not pro-ceed-ed far when I be-gan to be-think me that the Cap-tain with whom I was to sail yet re-mained un-seen by me though in-deed in many cas-es a whale ship will be com-plete-ly fit-ted out and re-ceive all her crew on board ere the cap-tain makes him-self vis-i-ble by ar-riv-ing to take com-mand for some-times the-se voy-ages are so pro-longed and the shore in-ter-vals at home so ex-ceed-ing-ly brief that if the cap-tain have a fam-i-ly or any ab-sorbing con-cern-ment of that sort he does not trou-ble him-self much about his ship in port but leaves her to the own-ers till all is ready for sea How-ev-er it is al-ways as well to have a look at him be-fore ir-re-vo-ca-bly com-mit-ting your-self in-to his hands Turn-ing back I ac-cost-ed Cap-tain Peleg in-quir-ing where Cap-tain Ahab was to be found  And what dost thou want of Cap-tain Ahab It s all right enough thou art shipped   Yes but I should like to see him   But I don t think thou wilt be able to at pre-sent I don t know ex-act-ly what s the mat-ter with him but he keeps close in-side the house a sort of sick and yet he don t look so In fact he ain t sick but no he is-n t well ei-ther Any how young man he won t al-ways see me so I don t sup-pose he will thee He s a queer man Cap-tain Ahab so some think but a good one Oh thou lt like him well enough no fear no fear He s a grand un-god-ly god like man Cap-tain Ahab does-n t speak much but when he does speak then you may well lis-ten Mark ye be fore-warned Ahab s above the com-mon Ahab s been in col-leges as well as  mong the can-ni-bals been used to deep-er won-ders than the waves fixed his fiery lance in might-ier stranger foes than whales His lance aye the keen-est and the surest that out of all our isle Oh he ain t Cap-tain Bil-dad no and he ain t Cap-tain Peleg he s Ahab boy and Ahab of old thou know-est was a crowned king   And a very vile one When that wicked king was slain the dogs did they not lick his blood   Come hith-er to me hith-er hith-er  said Peleg with a sig-nif-i-cance in his eye that al-most star-tled me  Look ye lad nev-er say that on board the Pe-quod Nev-er say it any-where Cap-tain Ahab did not name him-self  Twas a fool-ish ig-no-rant whim of his crazy wid-owed moth-er who died when he was on-ly a twelve-mon-th old And yet the old squaw Tistig at Gay-head said that the name would some-how prove prophet-ic And per-haps oth-er fools like her may tell thee the same I wish to warn thee It s a lie I know Cap-tain Ahab well I ve sailed with him as mate years ago I know what he is a good man not a pi-ous good man like Bil-dad but a swear-ing good man some-thing like me on-ly there s a good deal more of him Aye aye I know that he was nev-er very jol-ly and I know that on the pas-sage home he was a lit-tle out of his mind for a spell but it was the sharp shoot-ing pains in his bleed-ing stump that brought that about as any one might see I know too that ev-er since he lost his leg last voy-age by that ac-cursed whale he s been a kind of moody des-per-ate moody and sav-age some-times but that will all pass off And on-ce for all let me tell thee and as-sure thee young man it s bet-ter to sail with a moody good cap-tain than a laugh-ing bad one So good bye to thee and wrong not Cap-tain Ahab be-cause he hap-pens to have a wicked name Be-sides my boy he has a wife not three voy-ages wed-ded a sweet re-signed girl Think of that by that sweet girl that old man has a child hold ye then there can be any ut-ter hope-less harm in Ahab No no my lad strick-en blast-ed if he be Ahab has his hu-man-i-ties  As I walked away I was full of thought-ful-ness what had been in-ci-den-tal-ly re-vealed to me of Cap-tain Ahab filled me with a cer-tain wild vague-ness of painful-ness con-cern-ing him And some-how at the time I felt a sym-pa-thy and a sor-row for him but for I don t know what un-less it was the cru-el loss of his leg And yet I al-so felt a strange awe of him but that sort of awe which I can-not at all de-scribe was not ex-act-ly awe I do not know what it was But I felt it and it did not dis-in-cline me to-wards him though I felt im-pa-tience at what seemed like mys-tery in him so im-per-fect-ly as he was known to me then How-ev-er my thoughts were at length car-ried in oth-er di-rec-tions so that for the pre-sent dark Ahab slipped my mind CHAPTER 17 The Ra-madan As Quee-queg s Ra-madan or Fast-ing and Hu-mil-i-a-tion was to con-tin-ue all day I did not choose to dis-turb him till to-wards night fall for I cher-ish the great-est re-spect to-wards ev-ery-body s re-li-gious obli-ga-tions nev-er mind how com-i-cal and could not find it in my heart to un-der-val-ue even a con-gre-ga-tion of an-ts wor-ship-ping a toad stool or those oth-er crea-tures in cer-tain parts of our earth who with a de-gree of foot-man-ism quite un-prece-dent-ed in oth-er plan-ets bow down be-fore the tor-so of a de-ceased land-ed pro-pri-etor mere-ly on ac-count of the in-or-di-nate pos-ses-sions yet owned and rent-ed in his name I say we good Pres-by-te-ri-an Chris-tians should be char-i-ta-ble in the-se things and not fan-cy our-selves so vast-ly su-pe-ri-or to oth-er mor-tals pa-gans and what not be-cause of their half crazy con-ceits on the-se sub-jec-ts There was Quee-queg now cer-tain-ly en-ter-tain-ing the most ab-surd no-tions about Yo-jo and his Ra-madan  but what of that Quee-queg thought he knew what he was about I sup-pose he seemed to be con-tent and there let him rest All our ar-gu-ing with him would not avail let him be I say and Heav-en have mer-cy on us al-l Pres-by-te-ri-ans and Pa-gans alike for we are all some-how dread-ful-ly cracked about the head and sad-ly need mend-ing Towards evening when I felt as-sured that all his per-for-mances and rit-u-als must be over I went up to his room and knocked at the door but no an-swer I tried to open it but it was fas-tened in-side  Quee-queg  said I soft-ly through the key hole  all silent  I say Quee-queg why don t you speak It s I Ish-mael  But all re-mained still as be-fore I be-gan to grow alarmed I had al-lowed him such abun-dant time I thought he might have had an apoplec-tic fit I looked through the key hole but the door open-ing in-to an odd cor-ner of the room the key hole prospect was but a crooked and sin-is-ter one I could on-ly see part of the foot board of the bed and a line of the wall but noth-ing more I was sur-prised to be-hold rest-ing again-st the wall the wood-en shaft of Quee-queg s har-poon which the land-la-dy the evening pre-vi-ous had tak-en from him be-fore our mount-ing to the cham-ber That s strange thought I but at any rate since the har-poon stands yon-der and he sel-dom or nev-er goes abroad with-out it there-fore he must be in-side here and no pos-si-ble mis-take  Quee-queg  Quee-queg   all still Some-thing must have hap-pened Apoplexy I tried to burst open the door but it stub-born-ly re-sist-ed Run-ning down stairs I quick-ly stat-ed my sus-pi-cions to the first per-son I met the cham-ber maid  La la  she cried  I thought some-thing must be the mat-ter I went to make the bed af-ter break-fast and the door was locked and not a mouse to be heard and it s been just so silent ev-er since But I thought may be you had both gone off and locked your bag-gage in for safe keep-ing La la ma am  Mistress mur-der Mrs Hussey apoplexy   and with the-se cries she ran to-wards the kitchen I fol-low-ing Mrs Hussey soon ap-peared with a mus-tard pot in one hand and a vine-gar cruet in the oth-er hav-ing just bro-ken away from the oc-cu-pa-tion of at-tend-ing to the cas-tors and scold-ing her lit-tle black boy mean-time  Wood house  cried I  which way to it Run for God s sake and fetch some-thing to pry open the door the axe  the axe he s had a stroke de-pend up-on it   and so say-ing I was un-me-thod-i-cal-ly rush-ing up stairs again emp-ty hand-ed when Mrs Hussey in-ter-posed the mus-tard pot and vine-gar cruet and the en-tire cas-tor of her coun-te-nance  What s the mat-ter with you young man   Get the axe For God s sake run for the doc-tor some one while I pry it open   Look here  said the land-la-dy quick-ly putting down the vine-gar cruet so as to have one hand free  look here are you talk-ing about pry-ing open any of my doors   and with that she seized my arm  What s the mat-ter with you What s the mat-ter with you ship-mate  In as calm but rapid a man-ner as pos-si-ble I gave her to un-der-stand the whole case Un-con-scious-ly clap-ping the vine-gar cruet to one side of her nose she ru-mi-nat-ed for an in-stant then ex-claimed  No I haven t seen it since I put it there  Run-ning to a lit-tle clos-et un-der the land-ing of the stairs she glanced in and re-turn-ing told me that Quee-queg s har-poon was miss-ing  He s killed him-self  she cried  It s un-fort nate Stig-gs done over again there goes an-oth-er coun-ter-pane God pity his poor moth-er  it will be the ru-in of my house Has the poor lad a sis-ter Where s that girl  there Bet-ty go to Snarles the Pain-ter and tell him to paint me a sign with  no sui-cides per-mit-ted here and no smok-ing in the par-lor   might as well kill both birds at on-ce Kill The Lord be mer-ci-ful to his ghost What s that noise there You young man avast there  And run-ning up af-ter me she caught me as I was again try-ing to force open the door  I don t al-low it I won t have my premis-es spoiled Go for the lock-smith there s one about a mile from here But avast  putting her hand in her side pock-et  here s a key that ll fit I guess let s see  And with that she turned it in the lock but alas Quee-queg s sup-ple-men-tal bolt re-mained un-with-drawn with-in  Have to burst it open  said I and was run-ning down the en-try a lit-tle for a good start when the land-la-dy caught at me again vow-ing I should not break down her premis-es but I tore from her and with a sud-den bod-i-ly rush dashed my-self full again-st the mark With a prodi-gious noise the door flew open and the knob slam-ming again-st the wall sent the plas-ter to the ceil-ing and there good heav-ens there sat Quee-queg al-to-geth-er cool and self col-lect-ed right in the mid-dle of the room squat-ting on his hams and hold-ing Yo-jo on top of his head He looked nei-ther one way nor the oth-er way but sat like a carved im-age with scarce a sign of ac-tive life  Quee-queg  said I go-ing up to him  Quee-queg what s the mat-ter with you   He hain t been a sit-tin so all day has he  said the land-la-dy But all we said not a word could we drag out of him I al-most felt like push-ing him over so as to change his po-si-tion for it was al-most in-tol-er-a-ble it seemed so painful-ly and un-nat-u-ral-ly con-strained es-pe-cial-ly as in all prob-a-bil-i-ty he had been sit-ting so for up-wards of eight or ten hours go-ing too with-out his reg-u-lar meals  Mrs Hussey  said I  he s alive at all even-ts so leave us if you please and I will see to this strange af-fair my-self  Clos-ing the door up-on the land-la-dy I en-deav-ored to pre-vail up-on Quee-queg to take a chair but in vain There he sat and all he could do for all my po-lite arts and blan-dish-ments he would not move a peg nor say a sin-gle word nor even look at me nor no-tice my pres-ence in the slight-est way I won-der thought I if this can pos-si-bly be a part of his Ra-madan do they fast on their hams that way in his na-tive is-land It must be so yes it s part of his creed I sup-pose well then let him rest he ll get up soon-er or lat-er no doubt It can t last for ev-er thank God and his Ra-madan on-ly comes on-ce a year and I don t be-lieve it s very punc-tu-al then I went down to sup-per After sit-ting a long time lis-ten-ing to the long sto-ries of some sailors who had just come from a plum pud-ding voy-age as they called it that is a short whal-ing voy-age in a schooner or brig con-fined to the north of the line in the At-lantic Ocean on-ly af-ter lis-ten-ing to the-se plum pud-dingers till near-ly eleven o clock I went up stairs to go to bed feel-ing quite sure by this time Quee-queg must cer-tain-ly have brought his Ra-madan to a ter-mi-na-tion But no there he was just where I had left him he had not stirred an inch I be-gan to grow vexed with him it seemed so down-right sense-less and in-sane to be sit-ting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room hold-ing a piece of wood on his head  For heav-en s sake Quee-queg get up and shake your-self get up and have some sup-per You ll starve you ll kill your-self Quee-queg  But not a word did he re-ply De-s-pair-ing of him there-fore I de-ter-mined to go to bed and to sleep and no doubt be-fore a great while he would fol-low me But pre-vi-ous to turn-ing in I took my heavy bearskin jack-et and threw it over him as it promised to be a very cold night and he had noth-ing but his or-di-nary round jack-et on For some time do all I would I could not get in-to the faintest doze I had blown out the can-dle and the mere thought of Quee-queg not four feet of-f sit-ting there in that un-easy po-si-tion stark alone in the cold and dark this made me re-al-ly wretched Think of it sleep-ing all night in the same room with a wide awake pa-gan on his hams in this drea-ry un-ac-count-able Ra-madan But some-how I dropped off at last and knew noth-ing more till break of day when look-ing over the bed-side there squat-ted Quee-queg as if he had been screwed down to the floor But as soon as the first glimpse of sun en-tered the win-dow up he got with stiff and grat-ing join-ts but with a cheer-ful look limped to-wards me where I lay pressed his fore-head again again-st mine and said his Ra-madan was over Now as I be-fore hint-ed I have no ob-jec-tion to any per-son s re-li-gion be it what it may so long as that per-son does not kill or in-sult any oth-er per-son be-cause that oth-er per-son don t be-lieve it al-so But when a man s re-li-gion be-comes re-al-ly fran-tic when it is a pos-i-tive tor-ment to him and in fine makes this earth of ours an un-com-fort-able inn to lodge in then I think it high time to take that in-di-vid-u-al aside and ar-gue the point with him And just so I now did with Quee-queg  Quee-queg  said I  get in-to bed now and lie and lis-ten to me  I then went on be-gin-ning with the rise and pro-gress of the prim-i-tive re-li-gions and com-ing down to the var-i-ous re-li-gions of the pre-sent time dur-ing which time I la-bored to show Quee-queg that all the-se Len-ts Ra-madans and pro-longed ham squat-tings in cold cheer-less rooms were stark non-sense bad for the health use-less for the soul op-posed in short to the ob-vi-ous laws of Hy-giene and com-mon sense I told him too that he be-ing in oth-er things such an ex-treme-ly sen-si-ble and saga-cious sav-age it pained me very bad-ly pained me to see him now so de-plorably fool-ish about this ridicu-lous Ra-madan of his Be-sides ar-gued I fast-ing makes the body cave in hence the spir-it caves in and all thoughts born of a fast must nec-es-sar-i-ly be half starved This is the rea-son why most dys-pep-tic re-li-gion-ists cher-ish such melan-choly no-tions about their here-afters In one word Quee-queg said I rather di-gres-sive-ly hell is an idea first born on an undi-gest-ed ap-ple dumpling and since then per-pet-u-at-ed through the hered-i-tary dys-pep-si-as nur-tured by Ra-madans I then asked Quee-queg whether he him-self was ev-er trou-bled with dys-pep-sia ex-press-ing the idea very plain-ly so that he could take it in He said no on-ly up-on one mem-o-rable oc-ca-sion It was af-ter a great feast given by his fa-ther the king on the gain-ing of a great bat-tle where-in fifty of the en-e-my had been killed by about two o clock in the af-ter-noon and all cooked and eat-en that very evening  No more Quee-queg  said I shud-der-ing  that will do  for I knew the in-fer-ences with-out his fur-ther hint-ing them I had seen a sailor who had vis-it-ed that very is-land and he told me that it was the cus-tom when a great bat-tle had been gained there to bar-be-cue all the slain in the yard or gar-den of the vic-tor and then one by one they were placed in great wood-en trenchers and gar-nished round like a pi-lau with bread-fruit and co-coanuts and with some pars-ley in their mouths were sent round with the vic-tor s com-pli-men-ts to all his friends just as though the-se pre-sen-ts were so many Christ-mas turkeys After all I do not think that my re-marks about re-li-gion made much im-pres-sion up-on Quee-queg Be-cause in the first place he some-how seemed dull of hear-ing on that im-por-tant sub-ject un-less con-sid-ered from his own point of view and in the sec-ond place he did not more than one third un-der-stand me couch my ideas sim-ply as I would and fi-nal-ly he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true re-li-gion than I did He looked at me with a sort of con-de-scend-ing con-cern and com-pas-sion as though he thought it a great pity that such a sen-si-ble young man should be so hope-less-ly lost to evan-gel-i-cal pa-gan piety At last we rose and dressed and Quee-queg tak-ing a prodi-gious-ly hearty break-fast of chow-ders of all sorts so that the land-la-dy should not make much prof-it by rea-son of his Ra-madan we sal-lied out to board the Pe-quod saun-ter-ing along and pick-ing our teeth with hal-ibut bones CHAPTER 18 His Mark As we were walk-ing down the end of the wharf to-wards the ship Quee-queg car-ry-ing his har-poon Cap-tain Peleg in his gruff voice loud-ly hailed us from his wig-wam say-ing he had not sus-pect-ed my friend was a can-ni-bal and fur-ther-more an-nounc-ing that he let no can-ni-bals on board that craft un-less they pre-vi-ous-ly pro-duced their pa-pers  What do you mean by that Cap-tain Peleg  said I now jump-ing on the bul-warks and leav-ing my com-rade stand-ing on the wharf  I mean  he replied  he must show his pa-pers   Yes  said Cap-tain Bil-dad in his hol-low voice stick-ing his head from be-hind Peleg s out of the wig-wam  He must show that he s con-vert-ed Son of dark-ness  he added turn-ing to Quee-queg  art thou at pre-sent in com-mu-nion with any Chris-tian church   Why  said I  he s a mem-ber of the first Con-gre-ga-tion-al Church  Here be it said that many tat-tooed sav-ages sail-ing in Nan-tuck-et ships at last come to be con-vert-ed in-to the church-es  First Con-gre-ga-tion-al Church  cried Bil-dad  what that wor-ships in Dea-con Deuteron-o-my Cole-man s meet-ing house  and so say-ing tak-ing out his spec-ta-cles he rubbed them with his great yel-low ban-dana hand-ker-chief and putting them on very care-ful-ly came out of the wig-wam and lean-ing stiffly over the bul-warks took a good long look at Quee-queg  How long hath he been a mem-ber  he then said turn-ing to me  not very long I rather guess young man   No  said Peleg  and he has-n t been bap-tized right ei-ther or it would have washed some of that dev-il s blue off his face   Do tell now  cried Bil-dad  is this Philistine a reg-u-lar mem-ber of Dea-con Deuteron-o-my s meet-ing I nev-er saw him go-ing there and I pass it ev-ery Lord s day   I don t know any-thing about Dea-con Deuteron-o-my or his meet-ing  said I  all I know is that Quee-queg here is a born mem-ber of the First Con-gre-ga-tion-al Church He is a dea-con him-self Quee-queg is   Young man  said Bil-dad stern-ly  thou art sky-lark-ing with me ex-plain thy-self thou young Hit-tite What church dost thee mean an-swer me  Find-ing my-self thus hard pushed I replied  I mean sir the same an-cient Catholic Church to which you and I and Cap-tain Peleg there and Quee-queg here and all of us and ev-ery moth-er s son and soul of us be-long the great and ev-er-last-ing First Con-gre-ga-tion of this whole wor-ship-ping world we all be-long to that on-ly some of us cher-ish some queer crotch-ets no ways touch-ing the grand be-lief in that we all join hands   Splice thou mean st splice hands  cried Peleg draw-ing nearer  Young man you d bet-ter ship for a mis-sion-ary in-stead of a fore mast hand I nev-er heard a bet-ter ser-mon Dea-con Deuteron-o-my why Father Map-ple him-self could-n t beat it and he s reck-oned some-thing Come aboard come aboard nev-er mind about the pa-pers I say tell Quo-hog there what s that you call him tell Quo-hog to step along By the great an-chor what a har-poon he s got there looks like good stuff that and he han-dles it about right I say Quo-hog or what-ev-er your name is did you ev-er stand in the head of a whale boat did you ev-er strike a fish  Without say-ing a word Quee-queg in his wild sort of way jumped up-on the bul-warks from thence in-to the bows of one of the whale boats hang-ing to the side and then brac-ing his left knee and pois-ing his har-poon cried out in some such way as this   Cap ain you see him small drop tar on wa-ter dere You see him well spose him one whale eye well den  and tak-ing sharp aim at it he dart-ed the iron right over old Bil-dad s broad brim clean across the ship s decks and struck the glis-ten-ing tar spot out of sight  Now  said Quee-queg qui-et-ly haul-ing in the line  spos ee him whale e eye why dad whale dead   Quick Bil-dad  said Peleg his part-ner who aghast at the close vicin-i-ty of the fly-ing har-poon had re-treat-ed to-wards the cab-in gang-way  Quick I say you Bil-dad and get the ship s pa-pers We must have Hedge-hog there I mean Quo-hog in one of our boats Look ye Quo-hog we ll give ye the nineti-eth lay and that s more than ev-er was given a har-pooneer yet out of Nan-tuck-et  So down we went in-to the cab-in and to my great joy Quee-queg was soon en-rolled among the same ship s com-pa-ny to which I my-self be-longed When all pre-lim-i-nar-ies were over and Peleg had got ev-ery-thing ready for sign-ing he turned to me and said  I guess Quo-hog there don t know how to write does he I say Quo-hog blast ye dost thou sign thy name or make thy mark  But at this ques-tion Quee-queg who had twice or thrice be-fore tak-en part in sim-i-lar cer-e-monies looked no ways abashed but tak-ing the of-fered pen copied up-on the pa-per in the prop-er place an ex-act coun-ter-part of a queer round fig-ure which was tat-tooed up-on his arm so that through Cap-tain Peleg s ob-sti-nate mis-take touch-ing his ap-pella-tive it stood some-thing like this  Quo-hog his X mark Mean-while Cap-tain Bil-dad sat earnest-ly and stead-fast-ly eye-ing Quee-queg and at last ris-ing solemn-ly and fum-bling in the huge pock-ets of his broad skirt-ed drab coat took out a bundle of trac-ts and se-lect-ing one en-ti-tled  The Lat-ter Day Com-ing or No Time to Lose  placed it in Quee-queg s hands and then grasp-ing them and the book with both his looked earnest-ly in-to his eyes and said  Son of dark-ness I must do my du-ty by thee I am part own-er of this ship and feel con-cerned for the souls of all its crew if thou still clingest to thy Pa-gan ways which I sad-ly fear I be-seech thee re-main not for aye a Belial bonds-man Spurn the idol Bell and the hideous drag-on turn from the wrath to come mind thine eye I say oh good-ness gra-cious steer clear of the fiery pit  Some-thing of the salt sea yet lin-gered in old Bil-dad s lan-guage het-ero-ge-neous-ly mixed with Scrip-tural and do-mes-tic phras-es  Avast there avast there Bil-dad avast now spoil-ing our har-pooneer  cried Peleg  Pious har-pooneers nev-er make good voy-ager-s it takes the shark out of  em no har-pooneer is worth a straw who aint pret-ty shark-ish There was young Nat Swaine on-ce the bravest boat head-er out of all Nan-tuck-et and the Vine-yard he joined the meet-ing and nev-er came to good He got so fright-ened about his plaguy soul that he shrinked and sheered away from whales for fear of af-ter claps in case he got stove and went to Davy Jones   Peleg Peleg  said Bil-dad lift-ing his eyes and hands  thou thy-self as I my-self hast seen many a per-ilous time thou know-est Peleg what it is to have the fear of death how then can st thou prate in this un-god-ly guise Thou be-li-est thine own heart Peleg Tell me when this same Pe-quod here had her three mas-ts over-board in that ty-phoon on Ja-pan that same voy-age when thou went mate with Cap-tain Ahab did st thou not think of Death and the Judg-ment then   Hear him hear him now  cried Peleg march-ing across the cab-in and thrust-ing his hands far down in-to his pock-ets   hear him all of ye Think of that When ev-ery mo-ment we thought the ship would sink Death and the Judg-ment then What With all three mas-ts mak-ing such an ev-er-last-ing thun-der-ing again-st the side and ev-ery sea break-ing over us fore and aft Think of Death and the Judg-ment then No no time to think about Death then Life was what Cap-tain Ahab and I was think-ing of and how to save all hand-s how to rig ju-ry mast-s how to get in-to the near-est port that was what I was think-ing of  Bil-dad said no more but but-ton-ing up his coat stalked on deck where we fol-lowed him There he stood very qui-et-ly over-look-ing some sail-mak-ers who were mend-ing a top sail in the waist Now and then he stooped to pick up a patch or save an end of tarred twine which oth-er-wise might have been wast-ed CHAPTER 19 The Prophet  Ship-mates have ye shipped in that ship  Quee-queg and I had just left the Pe-quod and were saun-ter-ing away from the wa-ter for the mo-ment each oc-cu-pied with his own thoughts when the above words were put to us by a stranger who paus-ing be-fore us lev-elled his mas-sive fore-fin-ger at the ves-sel in ques-tion He was but shab-bi-ly ap-par-elled in fad-ed jack-et and patched trowsers a rag of a black hand-ker-chief in-vest-ing his neck A con-flu-ent small pox had in all di-rec-tions flowed over his face and left it like the com-pli-cat-ed ribbed bed of a tor-rent when the rush-ing wa-ters have been dried up  Have ye shipped in her  he re-peat-ed  You mean the ship Pe-quod I sup-pose  said I try-ing to gain a lit-tle more time for an un-in-ter-rupt-ed look at him  Aye the Pe-quod that ship there  he said draw-ing back his whole arm and then rapid-ly shov-ing it straight out from him with the fixed bay-o-net of his point-ed fin-ger dart-ed full at the ob-ject  Yes  said I  we have just signed the ar-ti-cles   Any-thing down there about your souls   About what   Oh per-haps you hav n t got any  he said quick-ly  No mat-ter though I know many chaps that hav n t got any  good luck to  em and they are all the bet-ter off for it A soul s a sort of a fifth wheel to a wag-on   What are you jab-ber-ing about ship-mate  said I  He s got enough though to make up for all de-fi-cien-cies of that sort in oth-er chaps  abrupt-ly said the stranger plac-ing a ner-vous em-pha-sis up-on the word he  Quee-queg  said I  let s go this fel-low has bro-ken loose from some-where he s talk-ing about some-thing and some-body we don t know   Stop  cried the stranger  Ye said true ye hav n t seen Old Thun-der yet have ye   Who s Old Thun-der  said I again riv-et-ed with the in-sane earnest-ness of his man-ner  Cap-tain Ahab   What the cap-tain of our ship the Pe-quod   Aye among some of us old sailor chaps he goes by that name Ye hav n t seen him yet have ye   No we hav n t He s sick they say but is get-ting bet-ter and will be all right again be-fore long   All right again be-fore long  laughed the stranger with a solemn-ly de-ri-sive sort of laugh  Look ye when Cap-tain Ahab is all right then this left arm of mine will be all right not be-fore   What do you know about him   What did they tell you about him Say that   They did-n t tell much of any-thing about him on-ly I ve heard that he s a good whale hunter and a good cap-tain to his crew   That s true that s true yes both true enough But you must jump when he gives an or-der Step and growl growl and go that s the word with Cap-tain Ahab But noth-ing about that thing that hap-pened to him off Cape Horn long ago when he lay like dead for three days and nights noth-ing about that dead-ly skrim-mage with the Spa-niard afore the al-tar in San-ta  heard noth-ing about that eh Noth-ing about the sil-ver cal-abash he spat in-to And noth-ing about his los-ing his leg last voy-age ac-cord-ing to the prophe-cy Did-n t ye hear a word about them mat-ters and some-thing more eh No I don t think ye did how could ye Who knows it Not all Nan-tuck-et I guess But hows ev-er may-hap ye ve heard tell about the leg and how he lost it aye ye have heard of that I dare say Oh yes that ev-ery one knows a most I mean they know he s on-ly one leg and that a par-ma-cetti took the oth-er off   My friend  said I  what all this gib-ber-ish of yours is about I don t know and I don t much care for it seems to me that you must be a lit-tle dam-aged in the head But if you are speak-ing of Cap-tain Ahab of that ship there the Pe-quod then let me tell you that I know all about the loss of his leg   All about it eh sure you do  all   Pret-ty sure  With fin-ger point-ed and eye lev-elled at the Pe-quod the beg-gar like stranger stood a mo-ment as if in a trou-bled rever-ie then start-ing a lit-tle turned and said   Ye ve shipped have ye Names down on the pa-pers Well well what s signed is signed and what s to be will be and then again per-haps it won t be af-ter all Any-how it s all fixed and ar-ranged a ready and some sailors or oth-er must go with him I sup-pose as well the-se as any oth-er men God pity  em Morn-ing to ye ship-mates morn-ing the in-ef-fa-ble heav-ens bless ye I m sor-ry I stopped ye   Look here friend  said I  if you have any-thing im-por-tant to tell us out with it but if you are on-ly try-ing to bam-boo-zle us you are mis-tak-en in your game that s all I have to say   And it s said very well and I like to hear a chap talk up that way you are just the man for him the likes of ye Morn-ing to ye ship-mates morn-ing Oh when ye get there tell  em I ve con-clud-ed not to make one of  em   Ah my dear fel-low you can t fool us that way you can t fool us It is the eas-i-est thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a great se-cret in him   Morn-ing to ye ship-mates morn-ing   Morn-ing it is  said I  Come along Quee-queg let s leave this crazy man But stop tell me your name will you   Eli-jah  Eli-jah thought I and we walked away both com-ment-ing af-ter each oth-er s fash-ion up-on this ragged old sailor and agreed that he was noth-ing but a hum-bug try-ing to be a bug-bear But we had not gone per-haps above a hun-dred yards when chanc-ing to turn a cor-ner and look-ing back as I did so who should be seen but Eli-jah fol-low-ing us though at a dis-tance Some-how the sight of him struck me so that I said noth-ing to Quee-queg of his be-ing be-hind but passed on with my com-rade anx-ious to see whether the stranger would turn the same cor-ner that we did He did and then it seemed to me that he was dog-ging us but with what in-tent I could not for the life of me imag-ine This cir-cum-stance cou-pled with his am-bigu-ous half hint-ing half re-veal-ing shroud-ed sort of talk now be-gat in me all kinds of vague won-der-men-ts and half ap-pre-hen-sions and all con-nect-ed with the Pe-quod and Cap-tain Ahab and the leg he had lost and the Cape Horn fit and the sil-ver cal-abash and what Cap-tain Peleg had said of him when I left the ship the day pre-vi-ous and the pre-dic-tion of the squaw Tistig and the voy-age we had bound our-selves to sail and a hun-dred oth-er shad-owy things I was re-solved to sat-is-fy my-self whether this ragged Eli-jah was re-al-ly dog-ging us or not and with that in-tent crossed the way with Quee-queg and on that side of it re-traced our steps But Eli-jah passed on with-out seem-ing to no-tice us This re-lieved me and on-ce more and fi-nal-ly as it seemed to me I pro-nounced him in my heart a hum-bug CHAPTER 2 All Astir A day or two passed and there was great ac-tiv-i-ty aboard the Pe-quod Not on-ly were the old sails be-ing mend-ed but new sails were com-ing on board and bolts of can-vas and coils of rig-ging in short ev-ery-thing be-to-kened that the ship s prepa-ra-tions were hur-ry-ing to a close Cap-tain Peleg sel-dom or nev-er went ashore but sat in his wig-wam keep-ing a sharp look out up-on the hands Bil-dad did all the pur-chas-ing and pro-vid-ing at the stores and the men em-ployed in the hold and on the rig-ging were work-ing till long af-ter night fall On the day fol-low-ing Quee-queg s sign-ing the ar-ti-cles word was given at all the in-ns where the ship s com-pa-ny were stop-ping that their chests must be on board be-fore night for there was no telling how soon the ves-sel might be sail-ing So Quee-queg and I got down our traps re-solv-ing how-ev-er to sleep ashore till the last But it seems they al-ways give very long no-tice in the-se cas-es and the ship did not sail for sev-er-al days But no won-der there was a good deal to be done and there is no telling how many things to be thought of be-fore the Pe-quod was ful-ly equipped Every one knows what a mul-ti-tude of things beds sauce pans knives and forks shov-els and tongs nap-kins nut crack-ers and what not are in-dis-pens-able to the busi-ness of house-keep-ing Just so with whal-ing which ne-ces-si-tates a three years house-keep-ing up-on the wide ocean far from all gro-cers coster-mon-gers doc-tors bak-ers and bankers And though this al-so holds true of mer-chant ves-sels yet not by any means to the same ex-tent as with whale-men For be-sides the great length of the whal-ing voy-age the nu-mer-ous ar-ti-cles pe-cu-liar to the pros-e-cu-tion of the fish-ery and the im-pos-si-bil-i-ty of re-plac-ing them at the re-mote har-bors usu-al-ly fre-quent-ed it must be re-mem-bered that of all ships whal-ing ves-sels are the most ex-posed to ac-ci-den-ts of all kinds and es-pe-cial-ly to the de-struc-tion and loss of the very things up-on which the suc-cess of the voy-age most de-pends Hence the spare boats spare spars and spare lines and har-poons and spare ev-ery-things al-most but a spare Cap-tain and du-pli-cate ship At the pe-ri-od of our ar-rival at the Is-land the heav-i-est stor-age of the Pe-quod had been al-most com-plet-ed com-pris-ing her beef bread wa-ter fu-el and iron hoops and staves But as be-fore hint-ed for some time there was a con-tin-u-al fetch-ing and car-ry-ing on board of di-vers odds and ends of things both large and small Chief among those who did this fetch-ing and car-ry-ing was Cap-tain Bil-dad s sis-ter a lean old la-dy of a most de-ter-mined and in-de-fati-ga-ble spir-it but with-al very kind-heart-ed who seemed re-solved that if she could help it noth-ing should be found want-ing in the Pe-quod af-ter on-ce fair-ly get-ting to sea At one time she would come on board with a jar of pick-les for the stew-ard s pantry an-oth-er time with a bunch of quil-ls for the chief mate s desk where he kept his log a third time with a roll of flan-nel for the small of some one s rheumat-ic back Nev-er did any wom-an bet-ter de-serve her name which was Char-i-ty Aunt Char-i-ty as ev-ery-body called her And like a sis-ter of char-i-ty did this char-i-ta-ble Aunt Char-i-ty bustle about hith-er and thith-er ready to turn her hand and heart to any-thing that promised to yield safe-ty com-fort and con-so-la-tion to all on board a ship in which her beloved broth-er Bil-dad was con-cerned and in which she her-self owned a score or two of well saved dol-lars But it was startling to see this ex-cel-lent heart-ed Quak-er-ess com-ing on board as she did the last day with a long oil ladle in one hand and a still longer whal-ing lance in the oth-er Nor was Bil-dad him-self nor Cap-tain Peleg at all back-ward As for Bil-dad he car-ried about with him a long list of the ar-ti-cles need-ed and at ev-ery fresh ar-rival down went his mark op-po-site that ar-ti-cle up-on the pa-per Every on-ce in a while Peleg came hob-bling out of his whale-bone den roar-ing at the men down the hatch-ways roar-ing up to the rig-gers at the mast head and then con-clud-ed by roar-ing back in-to his wig-wam Dur-ing the-se days of prepa-ra-tion Quee-queg and I of-ten vis-it-ed the craft and as of-ten I asked about Cap-tain Ahab and how he was and when he was go-ing to come on board his ship To the-se ques-tions they would an-swer that he was get-ting bet-ter and bet-ter and was ex-pect-ed aboard ev-ery day mean-time the two cap-tains Peleg and Bil-dad could at-tend to ev-ery-thing nec-es-sary to fit the ves-sel for the voy-age If I had been down-right hon-est with my-self I would have seen very plain-ly in my heart that I did but half fan-cy be-ing com-mit-ted this way to so long a voy-age with-out on-ce lay-ing my eyes on the man who was to be the ab-so-lute dic-ta-tor of it so soon as the ship sailed out up-on the open sea But when a man sus-pec-ts any wrong it some-times hap-pens that if he be al-ready in-volved in the mat-ter he in-sen-si-bly strives to cov-er up his sus-pi-cions even from him-self And much this way it was with me I said noth-ing and tried to think noth-ing At last it was given out that some time next day the ship would cer-tain-ly sail So next morn-ing Quee-queg and I took a very ear-ly start CHAPTER 21 Go-ing Aboard It was near-ly six o clock but on-ly grey im-per-fect misty dawn when we drew nigh the wharf  There are some sailors run-ning ahead there if I see right  said I to Quee-queg  it can t be shad-ows she s off by sun-rise I guess come on   Avast  cried a voice whose own-er at the same time com-ing close be-hind us laid a hand up-on both our shoul-ders and then in-sin-u-at-ing him-self be-tween us stood stoop-ing for-ward a lit-tle in the un-cer-tain twi-light strange-ly peer-ing from Quee-queg to me It was Eli-jah  Go-ing aboard   Hands off will you  said I  Lookee here  said Quee-queg shak-ing him-self  go  way   Ain t go-ing aboard then   Yes we are  said I  but what busi-ness is that of yours Do you know Mr Eli-jah that I con-sid-er you a lit-tle im-per-ti-nent   No no no I was-n t aware of that  said Eli-jah slow-ly and won-der-ing-ly look-ing from me to Quee-queg with the most un-ac-count-able glances  Eli-jah  said I  you will oblige my friend and me by with-draw-ing We are go-ing to the In-di-an and Paci-fic Oceans and would prefer not to be de-tained   Ye be be ye Com-ing back afore break-fast   He s cracked Quee-queg  said I  come on   Hol-loa  cried sta-tion-ary Eli-jah hail-ing us when we had re-moved a few paces  Nev-er mind him  said I  Quee-queg come on  But he stole up to us again and sud-den-ly clap-ping his hand on my shoul-der said  Did ye see any-thing look-ing like men go-ing to-wards that ship a while ago  Struck by this plain mat-ter of fact ques-tion I an-swered say-ing  Yes I thought I did see four or five men but it was too dim to be sure   Very dim very dim  said Eli-jah  Morn-ing to ye  Once more we quit-ted him but on-ce more he came soft-ly af-ter us and touch-ing my shoul-der again said  See if you can find  em now will ye  Find who   Morn-ing to ye morn-ing to ye  he re-joined again mov-ing off  Oh I was go-ing to warn ye again-st but nev-er mind nev-er mind it s all one all in the fam-i-ly too  sharp frost this morn-ing ain t it Good bye to ye Shan t see ye again very soon I guess un-less it s be-fore the Grand Jury  And with the-se cracked words he fi-nal-ly de-part-ed leav-ing me for the mo-ment in no small won-der-ment at his fran-tic im-pu-dence At last step-ping on board the Pe-quod we found ev-ery-thing in pro-found qui-et not a soul mov-ing The cab-in en-trance was locked with-in the hatch-es were all on and lum-bered with coils of rig-ging Go-ing for-ward to the fore-castle we found the slide of the scut-tle open See-ing a light we went down and found on-ly an old rig-ger there wrapped in a tat-tered pea jack-et He was thrown at whole length up-on two chests his face down-wards and in-closed in his fold-ed ar-ms The pro-foundest slum-ber slept up-on him  Those sailors we saw Quee-queg where can they have gone to  said I look-ing du-bi-ous-ly at the sleep-er But it seemed that when on the wharf Quee-queg had not at all no-ticed what I now al-lud-ed to hence I would have thought my-self to have been op-ti-cal-ly de-ceived in that mat-ter were it not for Eli-jah s oth-er-wise in-ex-pli-ca-ble ques-tion But I beat the thing down and again mark-ing the sleep-er joc-u-lar-ly hint-ed to Quee-queg that per-haps we had best sit up with the body telling him to es-tab-lish him-self ac-cord-ing-ly He put his hand up-on the sleep-er s rear as though feel-ing if it was soft enough and then with-out more ado sat qui-et-ly down there  Gra-cious Quee-queg don t sit there  said I  Oh per-ry dood seat  said Quee-queg  my coun-try way won t hurt him face   Face  said I  call that his face very benev-o-lent coun-te-nance then but how hard he breathes he s heav-ing him-self get off Quee-queg you are heavy it s grind-ing the face of the poor Get off Quee-queg Look he ll twitch you off soon I won-der he don t wake  Quee-queg re-moved him-self to just be-yond the head of the sleep-er and light-ed his tom-a-hawk pipe I sat at the feet We kept the pipe pass-ing over the sleep-er from one to the oth-er Mean-while up-on ques-tion-ing him in his bro-ken fash-ion Quee-queg gave me to un-der-stand that in his land ow-ing to the ab-sence of set-tees and so-fas of all sorts the king chiefs and great peo-ple gen-er-al-ly were in the cus-tom of fat-ten-ing some of the low-er or-ders for ot-tomans and to fur-nish a house com-fort-ably in that re-spect you had on-ly to buy up eight or ten lazy fel-lows and lay them round in the piers and al-coves Be-sides it was very con-ve-nient on an ex-cur-sion much bet-ter than those gar-den chairs which are con-vert-ible in-to walk-ing sticks up-on oc-ca-sion a chief call-ing his at-ten-dant and de-sir-ing him to make a set-tee of him-self un-der a spread-ing tree per-haps in some damp marshy place While nar-rat-ing the-se things ev-ery time Quee-queg re-ceived the tom-a-hawk from me he flour-ished the hatch-et side of it over the sleep-er s head  What s that for Quee-queg   Per-ry easy kill e oh per-ry easy  He was go-ing on with some wild rem-i-nis-cences about his tom-a-hawk pipe which it seemed had in its two us-es both brained his foes and soothed his soul when we were di-rect-ly at-tract-ed to the sleep-ing rig-ger The strong va-por now com-plete-ly fill-ing the con-tract-ed hole it be-gan to tell up-on him He breathed with a sort of muf-fled-ness then seemed trou-bled in the nose then re-volved over on-ce or twice then sat up and rubbed his eyes  Hol-loa  he breathed at last  who be ye smok-ers   Shipped men  an-swered I  when does she sail   Aye aye ye are go-ing in her be ye She sails to day The Cap-tain came aboard last night   What Cap-tain  Ahab   Who but him in-deed  I was go-ing to ask him some fur-ther ques-tions con-cern-ing Ahab when we heard a noise on deck  Hol-loa Star-buck s astir  said the rig-ger  He s a live-ly chief mate that good man and a pi-ous but all alive now I must turn to  And so say-ing he went on deck and we fol-lowed It was now clear sun-rise Soon the crew came on board in twos and threes the rig-gers be-stirred them-selves the mates were ac-tive-ly en-gaged and sev-er-al of the shore peo-ple were busy in bring-ing var-i-ous last things on board Mean-while Cap-tain Ahab re-mained in-vis-i-bly en-shrined with-in his cab-in CHAPTER 22 Mer-ry Christ-mas At length to-wards noon up-on the fi-nal dis-missal of the ship s rig-gers and af-ter the Pe-quod had been hauled out from the wharf and af-ter the ev-er thought-ful Char-i-ty had come off in a whale boat with her last gift a night cap for Stubb the sec-ond mate her broth-er in law and a spare Bi-ble for the stew-ard af-ter all this the two Cap-tains Peleg and Bil-dad is-sued from the cab-in and turn-ing to the chief mate Peleg said  Now Mr Star-buck are you sure ev-ery-thing is right Cap-tain Ahab is all ready just spoke to him noth-ing more to be got from shore eh Well call all hands then Muster  em aft here blast  em   No need of pro-fane words how-ev-er great the hur-ry Peleg  said Bil-dad  but away with thee friend Star-buck and do our bid-ding  How now Here up-on the very point of start-ing for the voy-age Cap-tain Peleg and Cap-tain Bil-dad were go-ing it with a high hand on the quar-ter deck just as if they were to be joint com-man-ders at sea as well as to all ap-pear-ances in port And as for Cap-tain Ahab no sign of him was yet to be seen on-ly they said he was in the cab-in But then the idea was that his pres-ence was by no means nec-es-sary in get-ting the ship un-der weigh and steer-ing her well out to sea In-deed as that was not at all his prop-er busi-ness but the pi-lot s and as he was not yet com-plete-ly re-cov-ered so they said there-fore Cap-tain Ahab stayed be-low And all this seemed nat-u-ral enough es-pe-cial-ly as in the mer-chant ser-vice many cap-tains nev-er show them-selves on deck for a con-sid-er-able time af-ter heav-ing up the an-chor but re-main over the cab-in table hav-ing a farewell mer-ry mak-ing with their shore friends be-fore they quit the ship for good with the pi-lot But there was not much chance to think over the mat-ter for Cap-tain Peleg was now all alive He seemed to do most of the talk-ing and com-mand-ing and not Bil-dad  Aft here ye sons of bach-e-lors  he cried as the sailors lin-gered at the main mast  Mr Star-buck drive  em aft   Strike the tent there   was the next or-der As I hint-ed be-fore this whale-bone mar-quee was nev-er pitched ex-cept in port and on board the Pe-quod for thir-ty years the or-der to strike the tent was well known to be the next thing to heav-ing up the an-chor  Man the cap-stan Blood and thun-der  jump   was the next com-mand and the crew sprang for the hand-spikes Now in get-ting un-der weigh the sta-tion gen-er-al-ly oc-cu-pied by the pi-lot is the for-ward part of the ship And here Bil-dad who with Peleg be it known in ad-di-tion to his oth-er of-fi-cers was one of the li-censed pi-lots of the port he be-ing sus-pect-ed to have got him-self made a pi-lot in or-der to save the Nan-tuck-et pi-lot fee to all the ships he was con-cerned in for he nev-er pi-lot-ed any oth-er craft Bil-dad I say might now be seen ac-tive-ly en-gaged in look-ing over the bows for the ap-proach-ing an-chor and at in-ter-vals singing what seemed a dis-mal stave of psalmody to cheer the hands at the wind-lass who roared forth some sort of a cho-rus about the girls in Booble Al-ley with hearty good will Nev-er-the-less not three days pre-vi-ous Bil-dad had told them that no pro-fane songs would be al-lowed on board the Pe-quod par-tic-u-lar-ly in get-ting un-der weigh and Char-i-ty his sis-ter had placed a small choice copy of Wat-ts in each sea-man s berth Mean-time over-see-ing the oth-er part of the ship Cap-tain Peleg ripped and swore astern in the most fright-ful man-ner I al-most thought he would sink the ship be-fore the an-chor could be got up in-vol-un-tar-i-ly I paused on my hand-spike and told Quee-queg to do the same think-ing of the per-ils we both ran in start-ing on the voy-age with such a dev-il for a pi-lot I was com-fort-ing my-self how-ev-er with the thought that in pi-ous Bil-dad might be found some sal-va-tion spite of his sev-en hun-dred and sev-en-ty sev-en-th lay when I felt a sud-den sharp poke in my rear and turn-ing round was hor-ri-fied at the ap-pari-tion of Cap-tain Peleg in the act of with-draw-ing his leg from my im-me-di-ate vicin-i-ty That was my first kick  Is that the way they heave in the marchant ser-vice  he roared  Spring thou sheep head spring and break thy back-bone Why don t ye spring I say all of ye spring Quo-hog spring thou chap with the red whiskers spring there Scotch cap spring thou green pan-ts Spring I say all of ye and spring your eyes out  And so say-ing he moved along the wind-lass here and there us-ing his leg very freely while im-per-turbable Bil-dad kept lead-ing off with his psalmody Thinks I Cap-tain Peleg must have been drink-ing some-thing to day At last the an-chor was up the sails were set and off we glid-ed It was a short cold Christ-mas and as the short north-ern day merged in-to night we found our-selves al-most broad up-on the win-try ocean whose freez-ing spray cased us in ice as in pol-ished ar-mor The long rows of teeth on the bul-warks glis-tened in the moon-light and like the white ivory tusks of some huge ele-phant vast curv-ing ici-cles de-pend-ed from the bows Lank Bil-dad as pi-lot head-ed the first watch and ev-er and anon as the old craft deep dived in-to the green seas and sent the shiv-er-ing frost all over her and the winds howled and the cordage rang his steady notes were heard   Sweet fields be-yond the swelling flood Stand dressed in liv-ing green So to the Jews old Canaan stood While Jor-dan rolled be-tween  Nev-er did those sweet words sound more sweet-ly to me than then They were full of hope and fruition Spite of this frigid win-ter night in the bois-ter-ous At-lantic spite of my wet feet and wet-ter jack-et there was yet it then seemed to me many a pleas-ant haven in store and meads and glades so eter-nal-ly ver-nal that the grass shot up by the spring un-trod-den un-wilt-ed re-mains at mid-sum-mer At last we gained such an off-ing that the two pi-lots were need-ed no longer The stout sail boat that had ac-com-pa-nied us be-gan rang-ing alongside It was cu-ri-ous and not un-pleas-ing how Peleg and Bil-dad were af-fect-ed at this junc-ture es-pe-cial-ly Cap-tain Bil-dad For loath to de-part yet very loath to leave for good a ship bound on so long and per-ilous a voy-age be-yond both stormy Capes a ship in which some thou-sands of his hard earned dol-lars were in-vest-ed a ship in which an old ship-mate sailed as cap-tain a man al-most as old as he on-ce more start-ing to en-coun-ter all the ter-rors of the piti-less jaw loath to say good bye to a thing so ev-ery way brim-ful of ev-ery in-ter-est to him  poor old Bil-dad lin-gered long paced the deck with anx-ious strides ran down in-to the cab-in to speak an-oth-er farewell word there again came on deck and looked to wind-ward looked to-wards the wide and end-less wa-ters on-ly bound-ed by the far off un-seen Eastern Con-ti-nen-ts looked to-wards the land looked aloft looked right and left looked ev-ery-where and nowhere and at last me-chan-i-cal-ly coil-ing a rope up-on its pin con-vul-sive-ly grasped stout Peleg by the hand and hold-ing up a lantern for a mo-ment stood gaz-ing hero-ical-ly in his face as much as to say  Nev-er-the-less friend Peleg I can stand it yes I can  As for Peleg him-self he took it more like a philoso-pher but for all his phi-los-o-phy there was a tear twin-kling in his eye when the lantern came too near And he too did not a lit-tle run from cab-in to deck now a word be-low and now a word with Star-buck the chief mate But at last he turned to his com-rade with a fi-nal sort of look about him   Cap-tain Bil-dad come old ship-mate we must go Back the main yard there Boat ahoy Stand by to come close alongside now Care-ful care-ful  come Bil-dad boy say your last Luck to ye Star-buck luck to ye Mr Stub-b luck to ye Mr Flask good bye and good luck to ye al-l and this day three years I ll have a hot sup-per smok-ing for ye in old Nan-tuck-et Hur-rah and away   God bless ye and have ye in His holy keep-ing men  mur-mured old Bil-dad al-most in-co-her-ent-ly  I hope ye ll have fine weath-er now so that Cap-tain Ahab may soon be mov-ing among ye a pleas-ant sun is all he needs and ye ll have plen-ty of them in the trop-ic voy-age ye go Be care-ful in the hunt ye mates Don t stave the boats need-less-ly ye har-pooneers good white cedar plank is raised full three per cent with-in the year Don t for-get your prayers ei-ther Mr Star-buck mind that coop-er don t waste the spare

spoil Be care-ful with the but-ter twen-ty cen-ts the pound it was and mind ye if   Come come Cap-tain Bil-dad stop palaver-ing  away  and with that Peleg hur-ried him over the side and both dropt in-to the boat Ship and boat di-verged the cold damp night breeze blew be-tween a scream-ing gull flew over-head the two hul-ls wild-ly rolled we gave three heavy heart-ed cheers and blind-ly plunged like fate in-to the lone At-lantic CHAPTER 23 The Lee Shore Some chap-ters back one Bulk-ing-ton was spo-ken of a tall new-land-ed mariner en-coun-tered in New Bed-ford at the inn When on that shiv-er-ing win-ter s night the Pe-quod thrust her vin-dic-tive bows in-to the cold ma-li-cious waves who should I see stand-ing at her helm but Bulk-ing-ton I looked with sym-pa-thet-ic awe and fear-ful-ness up-on the man who in mid win-ter just land-ed from a four years dan-ger-ous voy-age could so un-rest-ing-ly push off again for still an-oth-er tem-pes-tu-ous term The land seemed scorch-ing to his feet Won-der-fullest things are ev-er the un-men-tion-able deep mem-o-ries yield no epi-taphs this six inch chap-ter is the stone-less grave of Bulk-ing-ton Let me on-ly say that it fared with him as with the storm tossed ship that mis-er-ably drives along the lee-ward land The port would fain give suc-cor the port is piti-ful in the port is safe-ty com-fort hearth-stone sup-per warm blan-kets friends all that s kind to our mor-tal-i-ties But in that gale the port the land is that ship s direst jeop-ardy she must fly all hos-pi-tal-i-ty one touch of land though it but graze the keel would make her shud-der through and through With all her might she crowds all sail off shore in so do-ing fights  gain-st the very winds that fain would blow her home-ward seeks all the lashed sea s land-less-ness again for refuge s sake for-lorn-ly rush-ing in-to per-il her on-ly friend her bit-ter-est foe Know ye now Bulk-ing-ton Glimpses do ye seem to see of that mor-tal-ly in-tol-er-a-ble truth that all deep earnest think-ing is but the in-trepid ef-fort of the soul to keep the open in-de-pen-dence of her sea while the wildest winds of heav-en and earth con-spire to cast her on the treach-er-ous slav-ish shore But as in land-less-ness alone re-sides high-est truth shore-less in-def-i-nite as God so bet-ter is it to per-ish in that howl-ing in-finite than be in-glo-ri-ous-ly dashed up-on the lee even if that were safe-ty For worm like then oh who would craven crawl to land Ter-rors of the ter-ri-ble is all this agony so vain Take heart take heart O Bulk-ing-ton Bear thee grim-ly demigod Up from the spray of thy ocean per-ish-ing straight up leaps thy apotheo-sis CHAPTER 24 The Ad-vo-cate As Quee-queg and I are now fair-ly em-barked in this busi-ness of whal-ing and as this busi-ness of whal-ing has some-how come to be re-gard-ed among lands-men as a rather un-po-et-i-cal and dis-rep-utable pur-suit there-fore I am all anx-i-ety to con-vince ye ye lands-men of the in-jus-tice here-by done to us hunters of whales In the first place it may be deemed al-most su-per-flu-ous to es-tab-lish the fact that among peo-ple at large the busi-ness of whal-ing is not ac-count-ed on a lev-el with what are called the lib-er-al pro-fes-sions If a stranger were in-tro-duced in-to any mis-cel-la-neous metropoli-tan so-ci-ety it would but slight-ly ad-vance the gen-er-al opin-ion of his mer-its were he pre-sent-ed to the com-pa-ny as a har-pooneer say and if in em-u-la-tion of the naval of-fi-cers he should ap-pend the ini-tials S W F Sperm Whale Fish-ery to his vis-it-ing card such a pro-ce-dure would be deemed pre em-i-nent-ly pre-sum-ing and ridicu-lous Doubtless one lead-ing rea-son why the world de-cli-nes hon-or-ing us whale-men is this they think that at best our vo-ca-tion amoun-ts to a butcher-ing sort of busi-ness and that when ac-tive-ly en-gaged there-in we are sur-round-ed by all man-ner of de-file-men-ts Butch-ers we are that is true But butch-ers al-so and butch-ers of the blood-i-est badge have been all Mar-tial Com-man-ders whom the world in-vari-ably de-lights to hon-or And as for the mat-ter of the al-leged un-clean-li-ness of our busi-ness ye shall soon be ini-ti-at-ed in-to cer-tain fac-ts hith-er-to pret-ty gen-er-al-ly un-known and which up-on the whole will tri-umphant-ly plant the sperm whale ship at least among the clean-li-est things of this tidy earth But even grant-ing the charge in ques-tion to be true what dis-or-dered slip-pery decks of a whale ship are com-pa-ra-ble to the un-speak-able car-rion of those bat-tle fields from which so many sol-diers re-turn to drink in all ladies plau-dits And if the idea of per-il so much en-hances the pop-u-lar con-ceit of the sol-dier s pro-fes-sion let me as-sure ye that many a vet-er-an who has freely marched up to a bat-tery would quick-ly re-coil at the ap-pari-tion of the sperm whale s vast tail fan-ning in-to ed-dies the air over his head For what are the com-pre-hen-si-ble ter-rors of man com-pared with the in-ter-linked ter-rors and won-ders of God But though the world scouts at us whale hunters yet does it un-wit-ting-ly pay us the pro-foundest homage yea an all abound-ing ado-ra-tion for al-most all the ta-pers lam-ps and can-dles that burn round the globe burn as be-fore so many shri-nes to our glo-ry But look at this mat-ter in oth-er lights weigh it in all sorts of scales see what we whale-men are and have been Why did the Dutch in De Wit-t s time have ad-mi-rals of their whal-ing fleets Why did Louis XVI of France at his own per-son-al ex-pense fit out whal-ing ships from Dunkirk and po-lite-ly in-vite to that town some score or two of fam-i-lies from our own is-land of Nan-tuck-et Why did Bri-tain be-tween the years 175 and 1788 pay to her whale-men in boun-ties up-wards of  1   And last-ly how comes it that we whale-men of Amer-i-ca now out-num-ber all the rest of the band-ed whale-men in the world sail a navy of up-wards of sev-en hun-dred ves-sels manned by eigh-teen thou-sand men year-ly con-sum-ing 4   of dol-lars the ships worth at the time of sail-ing 2   and ev-ery year im-port-ing in-to our har-bors a well reaped har-vest of 7   How comes all this if there be not some-thing puis-sant in whal-ing But this is not the half look again I freely as-sert that the cos-mopo-lite philoso-pher can-not for his life point out one sin-gle peace-ful in-flu-ence which with-in the last six-ty years has op-er-at-ed more po-ten-tial-ly up-on the whole broad world tak-en in one ag-gre-gate than the high and mighty busi-ness of whal-ing One way and an-oth-er it has be-got-ten even-ts so re-mark-able in them-selves and so con-tin-u-ous-ly mo-men-tous in their se-quen-tial is-sues that whal-ing may well be re-gard-ed as that Egyp-tian moth-er who bore off-spring them-selves preg-nant from her womb It would be a hope-less end-less task to cat-a-logue all the-se things Let a hand-ful suf-fice For many years past the whale ship has been the pi-o-neer in fer-ret-ing out the re-motest and least known parts of the earth She has ex-plored seas and archipela-goes which had no chart where no Cook or Van-cou-ver had ev-er sailed If Amer-i-can and Euro-pean men of war now peace-ful-ly ride in on-ce sav-age har-bors let them fire salutes to the hon-or and glo-ry of the whale ship which orig-i-nal-ly showed them the way and first in-ter-pret-ed be-tween them and the sav-ages They may cel-e-brate as they will the heroes of Ex-plor-ing Ex-pe-di-tions your Cooks your Krusen-sterns but I say that scores of anony-mous Cap-tains have sailed out of Nan-tuck-et that were as great and greater than your Cook and your Krusen-stern For in their suc-cour-less emp-ty hand-ed-ness they in the hea-then-ish sharked wa-ters and by the beach-es of un-record-ed javelin is-lands bat-tled with vir-gin won-ders and ter-rors that Cook with all his mari-nes and mus-kets would not will-ing-ly have dared All that is made such a flour-ish of in the old South Sea Voy-ages those things were but the life time com-mon-places of our hero-ic

whale fish-ery round-ed Cape Horn no com-merce but colo-nial scarce-ly any in-ter-course but colo-nial was car-ried on be-tween Europe and the long line of the op-u-lent Span-ish provinces on the Paci-fic coast It was the whale-man who first broke through the jeal-ous pol-i-cy of the Span-ish crown touch-ing those colonies and if space per-mit-ted it might be dis-tinct-ly shown how from those whale-men at last even-tu-at-ed the lib-er-a-tion of Peru Chili and Bo-livia from the yoke of Old Spain and the es-tab-lish-ment of the eter-nal democ-ra-cy in those parts That great Amer-i-ca on the oth-er side of the sphere Aus-tralia was given to the en-light-ened world by the whale-man After its first blun-der born dis-cov-ery by a Dutch-man all oth-er ships long shunned those shores as pes-tif-er-ous-ly bar-barous but the whale ship touched there The whale ship is the true moth-er of that now mighty colony More-over in the in-fan-cy of the first Aus-tralian set-tle-ment the em-i-grants were sev-er-al times saved from star-va-tion by the benev-o-lent bis-cuit of the whale ship luck-i-ly drop-ping an an-chor in their wa-ters The un-count-ed isles of all Poly-ne-sia con-fess the same truth and do com-mer-cial homage to the whale ship that cleared the way for the mis-sion-ary and the mer-chant and in many cas-es car-ried the prim-i-tive mis-sion-ar-ies to their first des-ti-na-tions If that dou-ble bolt-ed land Ja-pan is ev-er to be-come hos-pitable it is the whale ship alone to whom the cred-it will be due for al-ready she is on the thresh-old But if in the face of all this you still de-clare that whal-ing has no  sthet-i-cal-ly no-ble as-so-ci-a-tions con-nect-ed with it then am I ready to shiv-er fifty lances with you there and un-horse you with a split hel-met ev-ery time The whale has no fa-mous au-thor and whal-ing no fa-mous chron-i-cler you will say The whale no fa-mous au-thor and whal-ing no fa-mous chron-i-cler Who wrote the first ac-count of our Le-viathan Who but mighty Job And who com-posed the first nar-ra-tive of a whal-ing voy-age Who but no less a prince than Al-fred the Great who with his own roy-al pen took down the words from Other the Nor-we-gian whale hunter of those times And who pro-nounced our glow-ing eu-lo-gy in Par-lia-ment Who but Ed-mund Burke True enough but then whale-men them-selves are poor dev-ils

The dig-ni-ty of our call-ing the very heav-ens at-test Ce-tus is a con-stel-la-tion in the South No more Drive down your hat in pres-ence of the Czar and take it off to Quee-queg No more I know a man that in his life-time has tak-en three hun-dred and fifty whales I ac-count that man more hon-or-able than that great cap-tain of an-tiq-ui-ty who boast-ed of tak-ing as many walled towns And as for me if by any pos-si-bil-i-ty there be any as yet undis-cov-ered prime thing in me if I shall ev-er de-serve any re-al re-pute in that small but high hushed world which I might not be un-rea-son-ably

dig-ni-ty of whal-ing I would fain ad-vance naught but sub-stan-ti-at-ed fac-ts But af-ter em-bat-tling his fac-ts an ad-vo-cate who should whol-ly sup-press a not un-rea-son-able sur-mise which might tell elo-quent-ly up-on his cause such an ad-vo-cate would he not be blame-wor-thy It is well known that at the coro-na-tion of kings and queens even mod-ern ones a cer-tain cu-ri-ous pro-cess of sea-son-ing them for their func-tions is gone through There is a salt-cel-lar of state so called and there may be a cas-tor of state How they use the salt pre-cise-ly who knows Cer-tain I am how-ev-er that a king s head is solemn-ly oiled at his coro-na-tion even as a head of sal-ad Can it be though that they anoint it with a view of mak-ing its in-te-ri-or run well as they anoint ma-chin-ery Much might be ru-mi-nat-ed here con-cern-ing the es-sen-tial dig-ni-ty of this re-gal pro-cess be-cause in com-mon life we es-teem but mean-ly and con-temptibly a fel-low who anoin-ts his hair and pal-pa-bly smells of that anoint-ing In truth a ma-ture man who us-es hair oil un-less medic-i-nal-ly that man has prob-a-bly got a quog-gy spot in him some-where As a gen-er-al rule he can t amount to much in his to-tal-i-ty But the on-ly thing to be con-sid-ered here is this what kind of oil is used at coro-na-tions Cer-tain-ly it can-not be olive oil nor macas-sar oil nor cas-tor oil nor bear s oil nor train oil nor cod liv-er oil What then can it pos-si-bly be but sperm oil in its un-man-u-fac-tured un-pol-lut-ed state the sweet-est of all oils Think of that ye loy-al Bri-tons we whale-men sup-ply your kings and queens with coro-na-tion stuff CHAPTER 26 Knights and Squires The chief mate of the Pe-quod was Star-buck a na-tive of Nan-tuck-et and a Quak-er by de-scent He was a long earnest man and though born on an icy coast seemed well adapt-ed to en-dure hot lat-i-tudes his flesh be-ing hard as twice baked bis-cuit Trans-port-ed to the Indies his live blood would not spoil like bot-tled ale He must have been born in some time of gen-er-al drought and famine or up-on one of those fast days for which his state is fa-mous On-ly some thir-ty arid sum-mers had he seen those sum-mers had dried up all his phys-i-cal su-per-flu-ous-ness But this his thin-ness so to speak seemed no more the to-ken of wast-ing anx-i-eties and cares than it seemed the in-di-ca-tion of any bod-i-ly blight It was mere-ly the con-den-sa-tion of the man He was by no means ill look-ing quite the con-trary His pure tight skin was an ex-cel-lent fit and close-ly wrapped up in it and em-balmed with in-ner health and strength like a re-viv-i-fied Egyp-tian this Star-buck seemed pre-pared to en-dure for long ages to come and to en-dure al-ways as now for be it Po-lar snow or tor-rid sun like a patent chronome-ter his in-te-ri-or vi-tal-i-ty was war-rant-ed to do well in all cli-mates Look-ing in-to his eyes you seemed to see there the yet lin-ger-ing im-ages of those thou-sand fold per-ils he had calm-ly con-front-ed through life A staid stead-fast man whose life for the most part was a telling pan-tomime of ac-tion and not a tame chap-ter of sounds Yet for all his hardy so-bri-ety and for-ti-tude there were cer-tain qual-i-ties in him which at times af-fect-ed and in some cas-es seemed well nigh to over-bal-ance all the rest Un-com-mon-ly con-sci-en-tious for a sea-man and en-dued with a deep nat-u-ral rev-er-ence the wild wa-tery lone-li-ness of his life did there-fore strong-ly in-cline him to su-per-sti-tion but to that sort of su-per-sti-tion which in some or-ga-ni-za-tions seems rather to spring some-how from in-tel-li-gence than from ig-no-rance Out-ward por-ten-ts and in-ward pre-sen-ti-men-ts were his And if at times the-se things bent the weld-ed iron of his soul much more did his far away do-mes-tic mem-o-ries of his young Cape wife and child tend to bend him still more from the orig-i-nal rugged-ness of his na-ture and open him still fur-ther to those la-tent in-flu-ences which in some hon-est heart-ed men re-strain the gush of dare dev-il dar-ing so of-ten evinced by oth-ers in the more per-ilous vi-cis-si-tudes of the fish-ery  I will have no man in my boat  said Star-buck  who is not afraid of a whale  By this he seemed to mean not on-ly that the most re-li-able and use-ful courage was that which aris-es from the fair es-ti-ma-tion of the en-coun-tered per-il but that an ut-ter-ly fear-less man is a far more dan-ger-ous com-rade than a cow-ard  Aye aye  said Stubb the sec-ond mate  Star-buck there is as care-ful a man as you ll find any-where in this fish-ery  But we shall ere long see what that word  care-ful pre-cise-ly means when used by a man like Stubb or al-most any oth-er whale hunter Star-buck was no cru-sader af-ter per-ils in him courage was not a sen-ti-ment but a thing sim-ply use-ful to him and al-ways at hand up-on all mor-tal-ly prac-ti-cal oc-ca-sions Be-sides he thought per-haps that in this busi-ness of whal-ing courage was one of the great sta-ple out-fits of the ship like her beef and her bread and not to be fool-ish-ly wast-ed Where-fore he had no fan-cy for low-er-ing for whales af-ter sun down nor for per-sist-ing in fight-ing a fish that too much per-sist-ed in fight-ing him For thought Star-buck I am here in this crit-i-cal ocean to kill whales for my liv-ing and not to be killed by them for theirs and that hun-dreds of men had been so killed Star-buck well knew What doom was his own fa-ther s Where in the bot-tom-less deeps could he find the torn lim-bs of his broth-er With mem-o-ries like the-se in him and more-over given to a cer-tain su-per-sti-tious-ness as has been said the courage of this Star-buck which could nev-er-the-less still flour-ish must in-deed have been ex-treme But it was not in rea-son-able na-ture that a man so or-ga-nized and with such ter-ri-ble ex-pe-ri-ences and re-mem-brances as he had it was not in na-ture that the-se things should fail in la-tent-ly en-gen-der-ing an el-e-ment in him which un-der suit-able cir-cum-stances would break out from its con-fine-ment and burn all his courage up And brave as he might be it was that sort of brav-ery chiefly vis-i-ble in some in-trepid men which while gen-er-al-ly abid-ing firm in the con-flict with seas or winds or whales or any of the or-di-nary ir-ra-tional hor-rors of the world yet can-not with-stand those more ter-ri-fic be-cause more spir-i-tu-al ter-rors which some-times men-ace you from the con-cen-trat-ing brow of an en-raged and mighty man But were the com-ing nar-ra-tive to re-veal in any in-stance the com-plete abase-ment of poor Star-buck s for-ti-tude scarce might I have the heart to write it for it is a thing most sor-row-ful nay shock-ing to ex-pose the fall of val-our in the soul Men may seem de-testable as joint stock com-pa-nies and na-tions knaves fools and mur-der-ers there may be men may have mean and mea-gre faces but man in the ide-al is so no-ble and so sparkling such a grand and glow-ing crea-ture that over any ig-no-min-ious blem-ish in him all his fel-lows should run to throw their costli-est robes That im-mac-u-late man-li-ness we feel with-in our-selves so far with-in us that it re-mains in-tact though all the out-er char-ac-ter seem gone bleeds with keen-est an-guish at the un-draped spec-ta-cle of a val-or ru-ined man Nor can piety it-self at such a shame-ful sight com-plete-ly sti-fle her up-braid-ings again-st the per-mit-ting stars But this au-gust dig-ni-ty I treat of is not the dig-ni-ty of kings and robes but that abound-ing dig-ni-ty which has no robed in-vesti-ture Thou shalt see it shin-ing in the arm that wields a pick or drives a spike that demo-crat-ic dig-ni-ty which on all hands ra-di-ates with-out end from God Him-self The great God ab-so-lute The cen-tre and cir-cum-fer-ence of all democ-ra-cy His om-nipres-ence our di-vine equal-i-ty If then to meanest mariners and rene-gades and cast-aways I shall here-after as-cribe high qual-i-ties though dark weave round them trag-ic graces if even the most mourn-ful per-chance the most abased among them all shall at times lift him-self to the ex-alt-ed moun-ts if I shall touch that work-man s arm with some ethe-re-al light if I shall spread a rain-bow over his dis-as-trous set of sun then again-st all mor-tal crit-ics bear me out in it thou just Spir-it of Equal-i-ty which hast spread one roy-al mantle of hu-man-i-ty over all my kind Bear me out in it thou great demo-crat-ic God who did-st not re-fuse to the swart con-vict Bun-yan the pale po-et-ic pearl Thou who did-st clothe with dou-bly ham-mered leaves of finest gold the stumped and pau-pered arm of old Cer-van-tes Thou who did-st pick up An-drew Jack-son from the peb-bles who did-st hurl him up-on a war horse who did-st thun-der him high-er than a throne Thou who in all Thy mighty earth-ly march-ings ev-er cullest Thy se-lectest cham-pi-ons from the king-ly com-mons bear me out in it O God CHAPTER 27 Knights and Squires Stubb was the sec-ond mate He was a na-tive of Cape Cod and hence ac-cord-ing to lo-cal us-age was called a Cape Cod man A hap-py go lucky nei-ther craven nor valiant tak-ing per-ils as they came with an in-dif-fer-ent air and while en-gaged in the most im-mi-nent cri-sis of the chase toil-ing away calm and col-lect-ed as a jour-ney-man join-er en-gaged for the year Good hu-mored easy and care-less he presid-ed over his whale boat as if the most dead-ly en-coun-ter were but a din-ner and his crew all in-vit-ed guests He was as par-tic-u-lar about the com-fort-able ar-range-ment of his part of the boat as an old stage driver is about the snug-ness of his box When close to the whale in the very death lock of the fight he han-dled his un-pity-ing lance cool-ly and off hand-ed-ly as a whistling tin-ker his ham-mer He would hum over his old rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the most ex-as-per-at-ed mon-ster Long us-age had for this Stubb con-vert-ed the jaws of death in-to an easy chair What he thought of death it-self there is no telling Whether he ev-er thought of it at all might be a ques-tion but if he ev-er did chance to cast his mind that way af-ter a com-fort-able din-ner no doubt like a good sailor he took it to be a sort of call of the watch to tum-ble aloft and be-stir them-selves there about some-thing which he would find out when he obeyed the or-der and not soon-er What per-haps with oth-er things made Stubb such an easy go-ing un-fear-ing man so cheer-i-ly trudg-ing off with the bur-den of life in a world full of grave ped-lars all bowed to the ground with their packs what helped to bring about that al-most im-pi-ous good hu-mor of his that thing must have been his pipe For like his nose his short black lit-tle pipe was one of the reg-u-lar fea-tures of his face You would al-most as soon have ex-pect-ed him to turn out of his bunk with-out his nose as with-out his pipe He kept a whole row of pipes there ready load-ed stuck in a rack with-in easy reach of his hand and when-ev-er he turned in he smoked them all out in suc-ces-sion light-ing one from the oth-er to the end of the chap-ter then load-ing them again to be in readi-ness anew For when Stubb dressed in-stead of first putting his legs in-to his trowsers he put his pipe in-to his mouth I say this con-tin-u-al smok-ing must have been one cause at least of his pe-cu-liar dis-po-si-tion for ev-ery one knows that this earth-ly air whether ashore or afloat is ter-ri-bly in-fect-ed with the name-less mis-eries of the num-ber-less mor-tals who have died ex-hal-ing it and as in time of the cholera some peo-ple go about with a cam-phor-at-ed hand-ker-chief to their mouths so like-wise again-st all mor-tal tribu-la-tions Stub-b s to-bac-co smoke might have op-er-at-ed as a sort of dis-in-fect-ing agent The third mate was Flask a na-tive of Tis-bury in Martha s Vine-yard A short stout rud-dy young fel-low very pug-na-cious con-cern-ing whales who some-how seemed to think that the great leviathans had per-son-al-ly and hered-i-tar-i-ly af-front-ed him and there-fore it was a sort of point of hon-or with him to de-stroy them when-ev-er en-coun-tered So ut-ter-ly lost was he to all sense of rev-er-ence for the many mar-vels of their ma-jes-tic bulk and mys-tic ways and so dead to any-thing like an ap-pre-hen-sion of any pos-si-ble dan-ger from en-coun-ter-ing them that in his poor opin-ion the won-drous whale was but a species of mag-ni-fied mouse or at least wa-ter rat re-quir-ing on-ly a lit-tle cir-cum-ven-tion and some small ap-pli-ca-tion of time and trou-ble in or-der to kill and boil This ig-no-rant un-con-scious fear-less-ness of his made him a lit-tle wag-gish in the mat-ter of whales he fol-lowed the-se fish for the fun of it and a three years voy-age round Cape Horn was on-ly a jol-ly joke that last-ed that length of time As a car-pen-ter s nails are di-vid-ed in-to wrought nails and cut nails so mankind may be sim-i-lar-ly di-vid-ed Lit-tle Flask was one of the wrought ones made to clinch tight and last long They called him King Post on board of the Pe-quod be-cause in form he could be well likened to the short square tim-ber known by that name in Arc-tic whalers and which by the means of many ra-di-at-ing side tim-bers in-sert-ed in-to it serves to brace the ship again-st the icy con-cus-sions of those bat-ter-ing seas Now the-se three mates Star-buck Stubb and Flask were mo-men-tous men They it was who by uni-ver-sal pre-scrip-tion com-mand-ed three of the Pe-quod s boats as heads-men In that grand or-der of bat-tle in which Cap-tain Ahab would prob-a-bly mar-shal his forces to de-scend on the whales the-se three heads-men were as cap-tains of com-pa-nies Or be-ing armed with their long keen whal-ing spears they were as a picked trio of lancers even as the har-pooneers were flingers of javelins And since in this fa-mous fish-ery each mate or heads-man like a Goth-ic Knight of old is al-ways ac-com-pa-nied by his boat steerer or har-pooneer who in cer-tain con-junc-tures pro-vides him with a fresh lance when the for-mer one has been bad-ly twist-ed or el-bowed in the as-sault and more-over as there gen-er-al-ly sub-sists be-tween the two a close in-ti-ma-cy and friend-li-ness it is there-fore but meet that in this place we set down who the Pe-quod s har-pooneers were and to what heads-man each of them be-longed First of all was Quee-queg whom Star-buck the chief mate had se-lect-ed for his squire But Quee-queg is al-ready known Next was Tashte-go an un-mixed In-di-an from Gay Head the most west-er-ly promon-to-ry of Martha s Vine-yard where there still ex-ists the last rem-nant of a vil-lage of red men which has long sup-plied the neigh-bor-ing is-land of Nan-tuck-et with many of her most dar-ing har-pooneers In the fish-ery they usu-al-ly go by the gener-ic name of Gay Head-ers Tashte-go s long lean sable hair his high cheek bones and black round-ing eye-s for an In-di-an Ori-en-tal in their large-ness but Antarc-tic in their glit-ter-ing ex-pres-sion all this suf-fi-cient-ly pro-claimed him an in-her-i-tor of the unvi-ti-at-ed blood of those proud war-rior hunters who in quest of the great New Eng-land moose had scoured bow in hand the abo-rig-i-nal forests of the main But no longer snuff-ing in the trail of the wild beasts of the wood-land Tashte-go now hunt-ed in the wake of the great whales of the sea the unerring har-poon of the son fit-ly re-plac-ing the in-fal-li-ble ar-row of the sires To look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky lim-bs you would al-most have cred-it-ed the su-per-sti-tions of some of the ear-lier Pu-ri-tans and half be-lieved this wild In-di-an to be a son of the Prince of the Pow-ers of the Air Tashte-go was Stubb the sec-ond mate s squire Third among the har-pooneers was Dag-goo a gi-gan-tic coal black ne-gro sav-age with a li-on like tread an Aha-suerus to be-hold Sus-pend-ed from his ears were two gold-en hoops so large that the sailors called them ring bolts and would talk of se-cur-ing the top sail hal-yards to them In his youth Dag-goo had vol-un-tar-i-ly shipped on board of a whaler ly-ing in a lone-ly bay on his na-tive coast And nev-er hav-ing been any-where in the world but in Africa Nan-tuck-et and the pa-gan har-bors most fre-quent-ed by whale-men and hav-ing now led for many years the bold life of the fish-ery in the ships of own-ers un-com-mon-ly heed-ful of what man-ner of men they shipped Dag-goo re-tained all his bar-bar-ic virtues and erect as a gi-raf-fe moved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet five in his socks There was a cor-po-re-al hu-mil-i-ty in look-ing up at him and a white man stand-ing be-fore him seemed a white flag come to beg truce of a fortress Cu-ri-ous to tell this im-pe-ri-al ne-gro Aha-suerus Dag-goo was the Squire of lit-tle Flask who looked like a chess man beside him As for the residue of the Pe-quod s com-pa-ny be it said that at the pre-sent day not one in two of the many thou-sand men be-fore the mast em-ployed in the Amer-i-can whale fish-ery are Amer-i-cans born though pret-ty near-ly all the of-fi-cers are Here-in it is the same with the Amer-i-can whale fish-ery as with the Amer-i-can army and mil-i-tary and mer-chant navies and the en-gi-neer-ing forces em-ployed in the con-struc-tion of the Amer-i-can Canals and Rail-roads The same I say be-cause in all the-se cas-es the na-tive Amer-i-can lib-er-al-ly pro-vides the brains the rest of the world as gen-er-ous-ly sup-ply-ing the mus-cles No small num-ber of the-se whal-ing sea-men be-long to the Azores where the out-ward bound Nan-tuck-et whalers fre-quent-ly touch to aug-ment their crews from the hardy peas-an-ts of those rocky shores In like man-ner the Green-land whalers sail-ing out of Hull or Lon-don put in at the Shet-land Is-lands to re-ceive the full com-ple-ment of their crew Upon the pas-sage home-wards they drop them there again How it is there is no telling but Is-lan-ders seem to make the best whale-men They were near-ly all Is-lan-ders in the Pe-quod Iso-la-toes too I call such not ac-knowl-edg-ing the com-mon con-ti-nent of men but each Iso-la-to liv-ing on a sep-a-rate con-ti-nent of his own Yet now fed-er-at-ed along one keel what a set the-se Iso-la-toes were An Anachar-sis Clootz dep-u-ta-tion from all the isles of the sea and all the ends of the earth ac-com-pa-ny-ing Old Ahab in the Pe-quod to lay the world s grievances be-fore that bar from which not very many of them ev-er come back Black Lit-tle Pip he nev-er did oh no he went be-fore Poor Alaba-ma boy On the grim Pe-quod s fore-castle ye shall ere long see him beat-ing his tam-bourine pre-lu-sive of the eter-nal time when sent for to the great quar-ter deck on high he was bid strike in with an-gels and beat his tam-bourine in glo-ry called a cow-ard here hailed a hero there CHAPTER 28 Ahab For sev-er-al days af-ter leav-ing Nan-tuck-et noth-ing above hatch-es was seen of Cap-tain Ahab The mates reg-u-lar-ly re-lieved each oth-er at the watch-es and for aught that could be seen to the con-trary they seemed to be the on-ly com-man-ders of the ship on-ly they some-times is-sued from the cab-in with or-ders so sud-den and peremp-to-ry that af-ter all it was plain they but com-mand-ed vi-car-i-ous-ly Yes their supre-me lord and dic-ta-tor was there though hith-er-to un-seen by any eyes not per-mit-ted to pen-e-trate in-to the now sa-cred re-treat of the cab-in Every time I as-cend-ed to the deck from my watch-es be-low I in-stant-ly gazed aft to mark if any strange face were vis-i-ble for my first vague dis-qui-etude touch-ing the un-known cap-tain now in the seclu-sion of the sea be-came al-most a per-tur-ba-tion This was strange-ly height-ened at times by the ragged Eli-jah s di-a-bol-i-cal in-co-her-ences un-in-vit-ed-ly re-cur-ring to me with a sub-tle en-er-gy I could not have be-fore con-ceived of But poor-ly could I with-stand them much as in oth-er moods I was al-most ready to smile at the solemn whim-si-cal-i-ties of that out-landish prophet of the wharves But what-ev-er it was of ap-pre-hen-sive-ness or un-easi-ness to call it so which I felt yet when-ev-er I came to look about me in the ship it seemed again-st all war-rantry to cher-ish such emo-tions For though the har-pooneers with the great body of the crew were a far more bar-bar-ic hea-then-ish and mot-ley set than any of the tame mer-chant ship com-pa-nies which my pre-vi-ous ex-pe-ri-ences had made me ac-quaint-ed with still I as-cribed this and right-ly as-cribed it to the fierce unique-ness of the very na-ture of that wild Scan-di-na-vian vo-ca-tion in which I had so aban-doned-ly em-barked But it was es-pe-cial-ly the as-pect of the three chief of-fi-cers of the ship the mates which was most forcibly cal-cu-lat-ed to al-lay the-se colour-less mis-giv-ings and in-duce con-fi-dence and cheer-ful-ness in ev-ery pre-sent-ment of the voy-age Three bet-ter more like-ly sea of-fi-cers and men each in his own dif-fer-ent way could not read-i-ly be found and they were ev-ery one of them Amer-i-cans a Nan-tuck-eter a Vine-yarder a Cape man Now it be-ing Christ-mas when the ship shot from out her har-bor for a space we had bit-ing Po-lar weath-er though all the time run-ning away from it to the south-ward and by ev-ery de-gree and min-ute of lat-i-tude which we sailed grad-u-al-ly leav-ing that mer-ci-less win-ter and all its in-tol-er-a-ble weath-er be-hind us It was one of those less low-er-ing but still grey and gloomy enough morn-ings of the tran-si-tion when with a fair wind the ship was rush-ing through the wa-ter with a vin-dic-tive sort of leap-ing and melan-choly ra-pid-i-ty that as I mount-ed to the deck at the call of the forenoon watch so soon as I lev-elled my glance to-wards the taffrail fore-bod-ing shiv-ers ran over me Real-i-ty out-ran ap-pre-hen-sion Cap-tain Ahab stood up-on his quar-ter deck There seemed no sign of com-mon bod-i-ly ill-ness about him nor of the re-cov-ery from any He looked like a man cut away from the stake when the fire has over-run-ning-ly wast-ed all the lim-bs with-out con-sum-ing them or tak-ing away one par-ti-cle from their com-pact-ed aged ro-bust-ness His whole high broad form seemed made of solid bronze and shaped in an un-al-ter-able mould like Cellini s cast Perseus Thread-ing its way out from among his grey hairs and con-tin-u-ing right down one side of his tawny scorched face and neck till it dis-ap-peared in his cloth-ing you saw a slen-der rod like mark livid-ly whitish It re-sem-bled that per-pen-dic-u-lar seam some-times made in the straight lofty trunk of a great tree when the up-per light-ning tear-ing-ly darts down it and with-out wrench-ing a sin-gle twig peels and grooves out the bark from top to bot-tom ere run-ning off in-to the soil leav-ing the tree still green-ly alive but brand-ed Whether that mark was born with him or whether it was the scar left by some des-per-ate wound no one could cer-tain-ly say By some tac-it con-sent through-out the voy-age lit-tle or no al-lu-sion was made to it es-pe-cial-ly by the mates But on-ce Tashte-go s se-nior an old Gay Head In-di-an among the crew su-per-sti-tious-ly as-sert-ed that not till he was full forty years old did Ahab be-come that way brand-ed and then it came up-on him not in the fury of any mor-tal fray but in an el-e-men-tal strife at sea Yet this wild hint seemed in-fer-en-tial-ly neg-a-tived by what a grey Manx-man in-sin-u-at-ed an old sepul-chral man who hav-ing nev-er be-fore sailed out of Nan-tuck-et had nev-er ere this laid eye up-on wild Ahab Nev-er-the-less the old sea tra-di-tions the im-memo-ri-al creduli-ties pop-u-lar-ly in-vest-ed this old Manx-man with preter-nat-u-ral pow-ers of dis-cern-ment So that no white sailor se-ri-ous-ly con-tra-dict-ed him when he said that if ev-er Cap-tain Ahab should be tran-quil-ly laid out which might hard-ly come to pass so he mut-tered then who-ev-er should do that last of-fice for the dead would find a birth mark on him from crown to sole So pow-er-ful-ly did the whole grim as-pect of Ahab af-fect me and the livid brand which streaked it that for the first few mo-men-ts I hard-ly not-ed that not a lit-tle of this over-bear-ing grim-ness was ow-ing to the bar-bar-ic white leg up-on which he part-ly stood It had pre-vi-ous-ly come to me that this ivory leg had at sea been fash-ioned from the pol-ished bone of the sperm whale s jaw  Aye he was dis-mast-ed off Ja-pan  said the old Gay Head In-di-an on-ce  but like his dis-mast-ed craft he shipped an-oth-er mast with-out com-ing home for it He has a quiv-er of  em  I was struck with the sin-gu-lar pos-ture he main-tained Upon each side of the Pe-quod s quar-ter deck and pret-ty close to the mizzen shrouds there was an auger hole bored about half an inch or so in-to the plank His bone leg stead-ied in that hole one arm el-e-vat-ed and hold-ing by a shroud Cap-tain Ahab stood erect look-ing straight out be-yond the ship s ev-er pitch-ing prow There was an in-fin-i-ty of firmest for-ti-tude a de-ter-mi-nate un-sur-ren-der-able wil-ful-ness in the fixed and fear-less for-ward ded-i-ca-tion of that glance Not a word he spoke nor did his of-fi-cers say aught to him though by all their min-utest ges-tures and ex-pres-sions they plain-ly showed the un-easy if not painful con-scious-ness of be-ing un-der a trou-bled mas-ter eye And not on-ly that but moody strick-en Ahab stood be-fore them with a cru-ci-fix-ion in his face in all the name-less re-gal over-bear-ing dig-ni-ty of some mighty woe Ere long from his first vis-it in the air he with-drew in-to his cab-in But af-ter that morn-ing he was ev-ery day vis-i-ble to the crew ei-ther stand-ing in his piv-ot hole or seat-ed up-on an ivory stool he had or heav-i-ly walk-ing the deck As the sky grew less gloomy in-deed be-gan to grow a lit-tle ge-nial he be-came still less and less a recluse as if when the ship had sailed from home noth-ing but the dead win-try bleak-ness of the sea had then kept him so se-clud-ed And by and by it came to pass that he was al-most con-tin-u-al-ly in the air but as yet for all that he said or per-cep-ti-bly did on the at last sun-ny deck he seemed as un-nec-es-sary there as an-oth-er mast But the Pe-quod was on-ly mak-ing a pas-sage now not reg-u-lar-ly cruis-ing near-ly all whal-ing prepar-a-tives need-ing su-per-vi-sion the mates were ful-ly com-pe-tent to so that there was lit-tle or noth-ing out of him-self to em-ploy or ex-cite Ahab now and thus chase away for that one in-ter-val the clouds that lay-er up-on lay-er were piled up-on his brow as ev-er all clouds choose the lofti-est peaks to pile them-selves up-on Nev-er-the-less ere long the warm war-bling per-sua-sive-ness of the pleas-ant hol-i-day weath-er we came to seemed grad-u-al-ly to charm him from his mood For as when the red cheeked danc-ing girls April and May trip home to the win-try mis-an-throp-ic woods even the barest ruggedest most thun-der cloven old oak will at least send forth some few green sprouts to wel-come such glad heart-ed vis-i-tan-ts so Ahab did in the end a lit-tle re-spond to the play-ful al-lur-ings of that girl-ish air More than on-ce did he put forth the faint blos-som of a look which in any oth-er man would have soon flow-ered out in a smile CHAPTER 29 En-ter Ahab to Him Stubb Some days elapsed and ice and ice-bergs all astern the Pe-quod now went rolling through the bright Quito spring which at sea al-most per-pet-u-al-ly reigns on the thresh-old of the eter-nal Au-gust of the Trop-ic The warm-ly cool clear ring-ing per-fumed over-flow-ing re-dun-dant days were as crys-tal gob-lets of Per-sian sher-bet heaped up flaked up with rose wa-ter snow The starred and state-ly nights seemed haughty dames in jew-elled vel-vets nurs-ing at home in lone-ly pride the mem-o-ry of their ab-sent con-quer-ing Ear-ls the gold-en hel-met-ed suns For sleep-ing man  twas hard to choose be-tween such win-some days and such se-duc-ing nights But all the witcheries of that un-wan-ing weath-er did not mere-ly lend new spel-ls and po-ten-cies to the out-ward world In-ward they turned up-on the soul es-pe-cial-ly when the still mild hours of eve came on then mem-o-ry shot her crys-tals as the clear ice most for-ms of noise-less twi-lights And all the-se sub-tle agen-cies more and more they wrought on Ahab s tex-ture Old age is al-ways wake-ful as if the longer linked with life the less man has to do with aught that looks like death Among sea com-man-ders the old grey-beards will of-ten-est leave their berths to vis-it the night cloaked deck It was so with Ahab on-ly that now of late he seemed so much to live in the open air that tru-ly speak-ing his vis-its were more to the cab-in than from the cab-in to the planks  It feels like go-ing down in-to one s tomb   he would mut-ter to him-self  for an old cap-tain like me to be de-scend-ing this nar-row scut-tle to go to my grave dug berth  So al-most ev-ery twen-ty four hours when the watch-es of the night were set and the band on deck sen-tinelled the slum-bers of the band be-low and when if a rope was to be hauled up-on the fore-castle the sailors flung it not rude-ly down as by day but with some cau-tious-ness dropt it to its place for fear of dis-turbing their slum-ber-ing ship-mates when this sort of steady qui-etude would be-gin to pre-vail ha-bit-u-al-ly the silent steers-man would watch the cab-in scut-tle and ere long the old man would emerge grip-ping at the iron ban-is-ter to help his crip-pled way Some con-sid-er-ing touch of hu-man-i-ty was in him for at times like the-se he usu-al-ly ab-stained from pa-trolling the quar-ter deck be-cause to his wea-ried mates seek-ing re-pose with-in six inch-es of his ivory heel such would have been the re-ver-ber-at-ing crack and din of that bony step that their dreams would have been on the crunch-ing teeth of sharks But on-ce the mood was on him too deep for com-mon re-gard-ings and as with heavy lum-ber like pace he was mea-sur-ing the ship from taffrail to main-mast Stubb the old sec-ond mate came up from be-low with a cer-tain unas-sured dep-re-cat-ing hu-mor-ous-ness hint-ed that if Cap-tain Ahab was pleased to walk the planks then no one could say nay but there might be some way of muf-fling the noise hint-ing some-thing in-dis-tinct-ly and hes-i-tat-ing-ly about a globe of tow and the in-ser-tion in-to it of the ivory heel Ah Stubb thou did-st not know Ahab then  Am I a can-non ball Stubb  said Ahab  that thou would-st wad me that fash-ion But go thy ways I had for-got Below to thy night-ly grave where such as ye sleep be-tween shrouds to use ye to the fill-ing one at last  Down dog and ken-nel  Start-ing at the un-forseen con-clud-ing ex-cla-ma-tion of the so sud-den-ly scorn-ful old man Stubb was speech-less a mo-ment then said ex-cit-ed-ly  I am not used to be spo-ken to that way sir I do but less than half like it sir   Avast grit-ted Ahab be-tween his set teeth and vi-o-lent-ly mov-ing away as if to avoid some pas-sion-ate temp-ta-tion  No sir not yet  said Stubb em-bold-ened  I will not tame-ly be called a dog sir   Then be called ten times a don-key and a mule and an ass and be-gone or I ll clear the world of thee  As he said this Ahab ad-vanced up-on him with such over-bear-ing ter-rors in his as-pect that Stubb in-vol-un-tar-i-ly re-treat-ed  I was nev-er served so be-fore with-out giv-ing a hard blow for it  mut-tered Stubb as he found him-self de-scend-ing the cab-in scut-tle  It s very queer Stop Stubb some-how now I don t well know whether to go back and strike him or what s that  down here on my knees and pray for him Yes that was the thought com-ing up in me but it would be the first time I ev-er did pray It s queer very queer and he s queer too aye take him fore and aft he s about the queer-est old man Stubb ev-er sailed with How he flashed at me  his eyes like pow-der pans is he mad Any-way there s some-thing on his mind as sure as there must be some-thing on a deck when it cracks He aint in his bed now ei-ther more than three hours out of the twen-ty four and he don t sleep then Did-n t that Dough Boy the stew-ard tell me that of a morn-ing he al-ways finds the old man s ham-mock clothes all rum-pled and tum-bled and the sheets down at the foot and the cov-er-lid al-most tied in-to knots and the pil-low a sort of fright-ful hot as though a baked brick had been on it A hot old man I guess he s got what some folks ashore call a con-science it s a kind of Tic Dol-ly row they say worse nor a toothache Well well I don t know what it is but the Lord keep me from catch-ing it He s full of rid-dles I won-der what he goes in-to the af-ter hold for ev-ery night as Dough Boy tel-ls me he sus-pec-ts what s that for I should like to know Who s made ap-point-men-ts with him in the hold Ain t that queer now But there s no telling it s the old game Here goes for a snooze Damn me it s worth a fel-low s while to be born in-to the world if on-ly to fall right asleep And now that I think of it that s about the first thing ba-bies do and that s a sort of queer too Damn me but all things are queer come to think of  em But that s again-st my prin-ci-ples Think not is my eleven-th com-mand-ment and sleep when you can is my twelfth So here goes again But how s that did-n t he call me a dog blazes he called me ten times a don-key and piled a lot of jack-ass-es on top of that He might as well have kicked me and done with it May-be he did kick me and I did-n t ob-serve it I was so tak-en all aback with his brow some-how It flashed like a bleached bone What the dev-il s the mat-ter with me I don t stand right on my legs Com-ing afoul of that old man has a sort of turned me wrong side out By the Lord I must have been dream-ing though How how how  but the on-ly way s to stash it so here goes to ham-mock again and in the morn-ing I ll see how this plaguey jug-gling thinks over by day-light  CHAPTER 3 The Pipe When Stubb had de-part-ed Ahab stood for a while lean-ing over the bul-warks and then as had been usu-al with him of late call-ing a sailor of the watch he sent him be-low for his ivory stool and al-so his pipe Light-ing the pipe at the bin-na-cle lamp and plant-ing the stool on the weath-er side of the deck he sat and smoked In old Norse times the thrones of the sea lov-ing Dan-ish kings were fab-ri-cat-ed saith tra-di-tion of the tusks of the nar-whale How could one look at Ahab then seat-ed on that tripod of bones with-out be-think-ing him of the roy-al-ty it sym-bol-ized For a Khan of the plank and a king of the sea and a great lord of Le-viathans was Ahab Some mo-men-ts passed dur-ing which the thick va-por came from his mouth in quick and con-stant puffs which blew back again in-to his face  How now  he so-lil-o-quized at last with-draw-ing the tube  this smok-ing no longer soothes Oh my pipe hard must it go with me if thy charm be gone Here have I been un-con-scious-ly toil-ing not plea-sur-ing aye and ig-no-rant-ly smok-ing to wind-ward all the while to wind-ward and with such ner-vous whiffs as if like the dy-ing whale my fi-nal jets were the strongest and fullest of trou-ble What busi-ness have I with this pipe This thing that is meant for serene-ness to send up mild white va-pors among mild white hairs not among torn iron grey locks like mine I ll smoke no more  He tossed the still light-ed pipe in-to the sea The fire hissed in the waves the same in-stant the ship shot by the bub-ble the sink-ing pipe made With slouched hat Ahab lurch-ing-ly paced the planks CHAPTER 31 Queen Mab Next morn-ing Stubb ac-cost-ed Flask  Such a queer dream King Post I nev-er had You know the old man s ivory leg well I dreamed he kicked me with it and when I tried to kick back up-on my soul my lit-tle man I kicked my leg right off And then presto Ahab seemed a pyra-mid and I like a blaz-ing fool kept kick-ing at it But what was still more cu-ri-ous Flask you know how cu-ri-ous all dreams are through all this rage that I was in I some-how seemed to be think-ing to my-self that af-ter all it was not much of an in-sult that kick from Ahab  Why  thinks I  what s the row It s not a re-al leg on-ly a false leg  And there s a mighty dif-fer-ence be-tween a liv-ing thump and a dead thump That s what makes a blow from the hand Flask fifty times more sav-age to bear than a blow from a cane The liv-ing mem-ber that makes the liv-ing in-sult my lit-tle man And thinks I to my-self all the while mind while I was stub-bing my sil-ly toes again-st that cursed pyra-mid so con-found-ed-ly con-tra-dic-to-ry was it all all the while I say I was think-ing to my-self  what s his leg now but a cane a whale-bone cane Yes  thinks I  it was on-ly a play-ful cud-gelling in fact on-ly a whale-bon-ing that he gave me not a base kick Be-sides  thinks I  look at it on-ce why the end of it the foot part what a small sort of end it is where-as if a broad foot-ed farmer kicked me there s a dev-il-ish broad in-sult But this in-sult is whit-tled down to a point on-ly  But now comes the great-est joke of the dream Flask While I was bat-ter-ing away at the pyra-mid a sort of bad-ger haired old mer-man with a hump on his back takes me by the shoul-ders and slews me round  What are you  bout  says he Slid man but I was fright-ened Such a phiz But some-how next mo-ment I was over the fright  What am I about  says I at last  And what busi-ness is that of yours I should like to know Mr Hump-back Do you want a kick  By the lord Flask I had no soon-er said that than he turned round his stern to me bent over and drag-ging up a lot of sea-weed he had for a clout what do you think I saw  why thun-der alive man his stern was stuck full of mar-lin-spikes with the points out Says I on sec-ond thoughts  I guess I won t kick you old fel-low   Wise Stubb  said he  wise Stubb  and kept mut-ter-ing it all the time a sort of eat-ing of his own gums like a chim-ney hag See-ing he was-n t go-ing to stop say-ing over his  wise Stubb wise Stubb  I thought I might as well fall to kick-ing the pyra-mid again But I had on-ly just lift-ed my foot for it when he roared out  Stop that kick-ing   Hal-loa  says I  what s the mat-ter now old fel-low   Look ye here  says he  let s ar-gue the in-sult Cap-tain Ahab kicked ye did-n t he   Yes he did  says I  right here it was   Very good  says he  he used his ivory leg did-n t he   Yes he did  says I  Well then  says he  wise Stubb what have you to com-plain of Did-n t he kick with right good will it was-n t a com-mon pitch pine leg he kicked with was it No you were kicked by a great man and with a beau-ti-ful ivory leg Stubb It s an hon-or I con-sid-er it an hon-or Lis-ten wise Stubb In old Eng-land the great-est lords think it great glo-ry to be slapped by a queen and made garter knights of but be your boast Stubb that ye were kicked by old Ahab and made a wise man of Re-mem-ber what I say be kicked by him ac-count his kicks hon-ors and on no ac-count kick back for you can t help your-self wise Stubb Don t you see that pyra-mid  With that he all of a sud-den seemed some-how in some queer fash-ion to swim off in-to the air I snored rolled over and there I was in my ham-mock Now what do you think of that dream Flask   I don t know it seems a sort of fool-ish to me tho    May be may be But it s made a wise man of me Flask D ye see Ahab stand-ing there side-ways look-ing over the stern Well the best thing you can do Flask is to let the old man alone nev-er speak to him what-ev-er he says Hal-loa What s that he shouts Hark   Mast head there Look sharp all of ye There are whales here-abouts  If ye see a white one split your lungs for him  What do you think of that now Flask ain t there a small drop of some-thing queer about that eh A white whale did ye mark that man Look ye there s some-thing spe-cial in the wind Stand by for it Flask Ahab has that that s bloody on his mind But mum he comes this way  CHAPTER 32 Ce-tol-o-gy Al-ready we are bold-ly launched up-on the deep but soon we shall be lost in its un-shored har-bour-less im-men-si-ties Ere that come to pass ere the Pe-quod s weedy hull rol-ls side by side with the bar-na-cled hul-ls of the leviathan at the out-set it is but well to at-tend to a mat-ter al-most in-dis-pens-able to a thor-ough ap-pre-cia-tive un-der-stand-ing of the more spe-cial leviathanic rev-e-la-tions and al-lu-sions of all sorts which are to fol-low It is some sys-tem-atized ex-hi-bi-tion of the whale in his broad gen-era that I would now fain put be-fore you Yet is it no easy task The clas-si-fi-ca-tion of the con-stituen-ts of a chaos noth-ing less is here es-sayed Lis-ten to what the best and lat-est au-thor-i-ties have laid down  No branch of Zool-o-gy is so much in-volved as that which is en-ti-tled Ce-tol-o-gy  says Cap-tain Scores-by A D 182  It is not my in-ten-tion were it in my pow-er to en-ter in-to the in-quiry as to the true method of di-vid-ing the cetacea in-to groups and fam-i-lies Ut-ter con-fu-sion ex-ists among the his-to-ri-ans of this an-i-mal sperm whale says Sur-geon Beale A D 1839  Un-fit-ness to pur-sue our re-search in the un-fath-omable wa-ters   Im-pen-e-tra-ble veil cov-er-ing our knowl-edge

those lights of zo-ol-o-gy and anato-my Nev-er-the-less though of re-al knowl-edge there be lit-tle yet of books there are a plen-ty and so in some small de-gree with ce-tol-o-gy or the sci-ence of whales Many are the men small and great old and new lands-men and sea-men who have at large or in lit-tle writ-ten of the whale Run over a few  The Authors of the Bi-ble Aris-totle Pliny Al-drovandi Sir Thomas Browne Ges-ner Ray Lin-n us Ron-deletius Wil-lough-by Green Arte-di Sib-bald Bris-son Marten Lac p de Bon-neter-re Des-marest Baron Cu-vier Fred-er-ick Cu-vier John Hun-ter Owen Scores-by Beale Ben-nett J Ross Browne the Author of Miri-am Coffin Olm-stead and the Rev T Cheev-er But to what ul-ti-mate gen-er-al-iz-ing pur-pose all the-se have writ-ten the above cit-ed ex-trac-ts will show Of the names in this list of whale au-thors on-ly those fol-low-ing Owen ev-er saw liv-ing whales and but one of them was a re-al pro-fes-sion-al har-pooneer and whale-man I mean Cap-tain Scores-by On the sep-a-rate sub-ject of the Green-land or right whale he is the best ex-ist-ing au-thor-i-ty But Scores-by knew noth-ing and says noth-ing of the great sperm whale com-pared with which the Green-land whale is al-most un-wor-thy men-tion-ing And here be it said that the Green-land whale is an usurper up-on the throne of the seas He is not even by any means the largest of the whales Yet ow-ing to the long pri-or-i-ty of his claims and the pro-found ig-no-rance which till some sev-en-ty years back in-vest-ed the then fab-u-lous or ut-ter-ly un-known sperm whale and which ig-no-rance to this pre-sent day still reigns in all but some few sci-en-tific re-treats and whale ports this usurpa-tion has been ev-ery way com-plete Ref-er-ence to near-ly all the leviathanic al-lu-sions in the great po-ets of past days will sat-is-fy you that the Green-land whale with-out one ri-val was to them the monar-ch of the seas But the time has at last come for a new procla-ma-tion This is Char-ing Cross hear ye good peo-ple all  the Green-land whale is de-posed  the great sperm whale now reigneth There are on-ly two books in be-ing which at all pre-tend to put the liv-ing sperm whale be-fore you and at the same time in the re-motest de-gree suc-ceed in the at-tempt Those books are Beale s and Ben-net-t s both in their time sur-geons to English South Sea whale ships and both ex-act and re-li-able men The orig-i-nal mat-ter touch-ing the sperm whale to be found in their vol-umes is nec-es-sar-i-ly small but so far as it goes it is of ex-cel-lent qual-i-ty though most-ly con-fined to sci-en-tific de-scrip-tion As yet how-ev-er the sperm whale sci-en-tific or po-et-ic lives not com-plete in any lit-er-a-ture Far above all oth-er hunt-ed whales his is an un-writ-ten life Now the var-i-ous species of whales need some sort of pop-u-lar com-pre-hen-sive clas-si-fi-ca-tion if on-ly an easy out-line one for the pre-sent here-after to be filled in all its de-part-men-ts by sub-se-quent la-bor-ers As no bet-ter man ad-vances to take this mat-ter in hand I here-upon of-fer my own poor en-deav-ors I promise noth-ing com-plete be-cause any hu-man thing sup-posed to be com-plete must for that very rea-son in-fal-li-bly be faulty I shall not pre-tend to a min-ute anatom-i-cal de-scrip-tion of the var-i-ous species or in this place at least to much of any de-scrip-tion My ob-ject here is sim-ply to pro-ject the draught of a sys-tem-ati-za-tion of ce-tol-o-gy I am the ar-chi-tect not the builder But it is a pon-der-ous task no or-di-nary let-ter sorter in the Post Of-fice is equal to it To grope down in-to the bot-tom of the sea af-ter them to have one s hands among the un-speak-able foun-da-tions ribs and very pelvis of the world this is a fear-ful thing What am I that I should es-say to hook the nose of this leviathan The aw-ful taunt-ings in Job might well ap-pal me Will he the leviathan make a covenant with thee Be-hold the hope of him is vain But I have swam through li-braries and sailed through oceans I have had to do with whales with the-se vis-i-ble hands I am in earnest and I will try There are some pre-lim-i-nar-ies to set-tle First The un-cer-tain un-set-tled con-di-tion of this sci-ence of Ce-tol-o-gy is in the very vestibule at-test-ed by the fact that in some quar-ters it still re-mains a moot point whether a whale be a fish In his Sys-tem of Na-ture A D 1776 Lin-n us de-clares  I here-by sep-a-rate the whales from the fish  But of my own knowl-edge I know that down to the year 185 sharks and shad alewives and her-ring again-st Lin-n us s ex-press edict were still found di-vid-ing the pos-ses-sion of the same seas with the Le-viathan The grounds up-on which Lin-n us would fain have ban-ished the whales from the wa-ters he states as fol-lows  On ac-count of their warm biloc-u-lar heart their lungs their mov-able eye-lids their hol-low ears pen-em in-tran-tem fem-i-nam mam-mis lac-tan-tem  and fi-nal-ly  ex lege natur ju-re mer-i-to-que  I sub-mit-ted all this to my friends Sime-on Macey and Charley Coffin of Nan-tuck-et both mess-mates of mine in a cer-tain voy-age and they unit-ed in the opin-ion that the rea-sons set forth were al-to-geth-er in-suf-fi-cient Charley pro-fane-ly hint-ed they were hum-bug Be it known that waiv-ing all ar-gu-ment I take the good old fash-ioned ground that the whale is a fish and call up-on holy Jon-ah to back me This fun-da-men-tal thing set-tled the next point is in what in-ter-nal re-spect does the whale dif-fer from oth-er fish Above Lin-n us has given you those items But in brief they are the-se lungs and warm blood where-as all oth-er fish are lun-g-less and cold blood-ed Next how shall we de-fine the whale by his ob-vi-ous ex-ter-nals so as con-spic-u-ous-ly to la-bel him for all time to come To be short then a whale is a spout-ing fish with a hor-i-zon-tal tail There you have him How-ev-er con-tract-ed that def-i-ni-tion is the re-sult of ex-pand-ed med-i-ta-tion A wal-rus spouts much like a whale but the wal-rus is not a fish be-cause he is am-phibi-ous But the last term of the def-i-ni-tion is still more co-gent as cou-pled with the first Al-most any one must have no-ticed that all the fish fa-mil-iar to lands-men have not a flat but a ver-ti-cal or up and down tail Where-as among spout-ing fish the tail though it may be sim-i-lar-ly shaped in-vari-ably as-sumes a hor-i-zon-tal po-si-tion By the above def-i-ni-tion of what a whale is I do by no means ex-clude from the leviathanic broth-er-hood any sea crea-ture hith-er-to iden-ti-fied with the whale by the best in-formed Nan-tuck-eters nor on the oth-er hand link with it any fish hith-er-to au-thor-i-ta-tive-ly re-gard-ed as alien Hence all the small-er spout-ing and hor-i-zon-tal tailed fish must be in-clud-ed in this ground plan of Ce-tol-o-gy Now then come the grand di-vi-sions of the en-tire whale host I am aware that down to the pre-sent time the fish styled La-matins and Du-gongs Pig fish and Sow fish of the Coffins of Nan-tuck-et are in-clud-ed by many nat-u-ral-ists among the whales But as the-se pig fish are a noisy con-temptible set most-ly lurk-ing in the mouths of rivers and feed-ing on wet hay and es-pe-cial-ly as they do not spout I deny their cre-den-tials as whales and have pre-sent-ed them with their pass-ports to quit the King-dom of Ce-tol-o-gy First Ac-cord-ing to mag-ni-tude I di-vide the whales in-to three pri-ma-ry BOOKS sub-di-vis-i-ble in-to CHAPTERS and the-se shall com-pre-hend them all both small and large I THE FOLIO WHALE II the OCTAVO WHALE III the DUODECIMO WHALE As the type of the FOLIO I pre-sent the Sperm Whale of the OCTAVO the Gram-pus of the DUODECIMO the Por-poise FOLIOS Among the-se I here in-clude the fol-low-ing chap-ters  I The Sperm Whale II the Right Whale III the Fin Back Whale IV the Hump backed Whale V the Ra-zor Back Whale VI the Sul-phur Bot-tom Whale BOOK I Fo-lio CHAPTER I Sperm Whale  This whale among the English of old vague-ly known as the Trumpa whale and the Phy-seter whale and the Anvil Head-ed whale is the pre-sent Cachalot of the French and the Potts-fich of the Ger-mans and the Macro-cephalus of the Long Words He is with-out doubt the largest in-hab-i-tant of the globe the most formidable of all whales to en-coun-ter the most ma-jes-tic in as-pect and last-ly by far the most valu-able in com-merce he be-ing the on-ly crea-ture from which that valu-able sub-stance sper-ma-ceti is ob-tained All his pe-cu-liar-i-ties will in many oth-er places be en-larged up-on It is chiefly with his name that I now have to do Philo-log-i-cal-ly con-sid-ered it is ab-surd Some cen-turies ago when the Sperm whale was al-most whol-ly un-known in his own prop-er in-di-vid-u-al-i-ty and when his oil was on-ly ac-ci-den-tal-ly ob-tained from the strand-ed fish in those days sper-ma-ceti it would seem was pop-u-lar-ly sup-posed to be de-rived from a crea-ture iden-ti-cal with the one then known in Eng-land as the Green-land or Right Whale It was the idea al-so that this same sper-ma-ceti was that quick-en-ing hu-mor of the Green-land Whale which the first syl-la-ble of the word lit-er-al-ly ex-press-es In those times al-so sper-ma-ceti was ex-ceed-ing-ly scarce not be-ing used for light but on-ly as an oint-ment and medica-ment It was on-ly to be had from the drug-gists as you nowa-days buy an ounce of rhubarb When as I opine in the course of time the true na-ture of sper-ma-ceti be-came known its orig-i-nal name was still re-tained by the deal-ers no doubt to en-hance its val-ue by a no-tion so strange-ly sig-nif-i-cant of its scarci-ty And so the ap-pel-la-tion must at last have come to be be-stowed up-on the whale from which this sper-ma-ceti was re-al-ly de-rived BOOK I Fo-lio CHAPTER II Right Whale  In one re-spect this is the most ven-er-a-ble of the leviathans be-ing the one first reg-u-lar-ly hunt-ed by man It yields the ar-ti-cle com-mon-ly known as whale-bone or baleen and the oil spe-cial-ly known as  whale oil  an in-fe-ri-or ar-ti-cle in com-merce Among the fish-er-men he is in-dis-crim-i-nate-ly des-ig-nat-ed by all the fol-low-ing ti-tles The Whale the Green-land Whale the Black Whale the Great Whale the True Whale the Right Whale There is a deal of ob-scu-ri-ty con-cern-ing the iden-ti-ty of the species thus mul-ti-tudi-nous-ly bap-tised What then is the whale which I in-clude in the sec-ond species of my Fo-lios It is the Great Mys-tice-tus of the English nat-u-ral-ists the Green-land Whale of the English whale-men the Baleine Or-di-naire of the French whale-men the Grow-lands Wal-fish of the Swedes It is the whale which for more than two cen-turies past has been hunt-ed by the Dutch and English in the Arc-tic seas it is the whale which the Amer-i-can fish-er-men have long pur-sued in the In-di-an ocean on the Brazil Banks on the Nor West Coast and var-i-ous oth-er parts of the world des-ig-nat-ed by them Right Whale Cruis-ing Grounds Some pre-tend to see a dif-fer-ence be-tween the Green-land whale of the English and the right whale of the Amer-i-cans But they pre-cise-ly agree in all their grand fea-tures nor has there yet been pre-sent-ed a sin-gle de-ter-mi-nate fact up-on which to ground a rad-i-cal dis-tinc-tion It is by end-less sub-di-vi-sions based up-on the most in-con-clu-sive dif-fer-ences that some de-part-men-ts of nat-u-ral his-to-ry be-come so re-pelling-ly in-tri-cate The right whale will be else-where treat-ed of at some length with ref-er-ence to elu-ci-dat-ing the sperm whale BOOK I Fo-lio CHAPTER III Fin Back  Un-der this head I reck-on a mon-ster which by the var-i-ous names of Fin Back Tall Spout and Long John has been seen al-most in ev-ery sea and is com-mon-ly the whale whose dis-tant jet is so of-ten de-scried by pas-sen-gers cross-ing the At-lantic in the New York pack-et tracks In the length he at-tains and in his baleen the Fin back re-sem-bles the right whale but is of a less port-ly girth and a lighter colour ap-proach-ing to olive His great lips pre-sent a ca-ble like as-pect formed by the in-ter-twist-ing slant-ing folds of large wrin-kles His grand dis-tin-guish-ing fea-ture the fin from which he de-rives his name is of-ten a con-spic-u-ous ob-ject This fin is some three or four feet long grow-ing ver-ti-cal-ly from the hin-der part of the back of an an-gu-lar shape and with a very sharp point-ed end Even if not the slight-est oth-er part of the crea-ture be vis-i-ble this iso-lat-ed fin will at times be seen plain-ly pro-ject-ing from the sur-face When the sea is mod-er-ate-ly calm and slight-ly marked with spher-i-cal rip-ples and this gnomon like fin stands up and casts shad-ows up-on the wrin-kled sur-face it may well be sup-posed that the wa-tery cir-cle sur-round-ing it some-what re-sem-bles a di-al with its style and wavy hour lines graved on it On that Ahaz di-al the shad-ow of-ten goes back The Fin Back is not gre-gar-i-ous He seems a whale hater as some men are man haters Very shy al-ways go-ing soli-tary un-ex-pect-ed-ly ris-ing to the sur-face in the re-motest and most sul-len wa-ters his straight and sin-gle lofty jet ris-ing like a tall mis-an-throp-ic spear up-on a bar-ren plain gift-ed with such won-drous pow-er and ve-loc-i-ty in swim-ming as to de-fy all pre-sent pur-suit from man this leviathan seems the ban-ished and un-con-quer-able Cain of his race bear-ing for his mark that style up-on his back From hav-ing the baleen in his mouth the Fin Back is some-times in-clud-ed with the right whale among a the-o-ret-ic species de-nom-i-nat-ed Whale-bone whales that is whales with baleen Of the-se so called Whale-bone whales there would seem to be sev-er-al va-ri-eties most of which how-ev-er are lit-tle known Broad nosed whales and beaked whales pike head-ed whales bunched whales un-der jawed whales and ros-trat-ed whales are the fish-er-men s names for a few sorts In con-nec-tion with this ap-pella-tive of  Whale-bone whales  it is of great im-por-tance to men-tion that how-ev-er such a nomen-cla-ture may be con-ve-nient in fa-cil-i-tat-ing al-lu-sions to some kind of whales yet it is in vain to at-tempt a clear clas-si-fi-ca-tion of the Le-viathan found-ed up-on ei-ther his baleen or hump or fin or teeth notwith-stand-ing that those marked parts or fea-tures very ob-vi-ous-ly seem bet-ter adapt-ed to af-ford the ba-sis for a reg-u-lar sys-tem of Ce-tol-o-gy than any oth-er de-tached bod-i-ly dis-tinc-tions which the whale in his kinds pre-sen-ts How then The baleen hump back fin and teeth the-se are things whose pe-cu-liar-i-ties are in-dis-crim-i-nate-ly dis-persed among all sorts of whales with-out any re-gard to what may be the na-ture of their struc-ture in oth-er and more es-sen-tial par-tic-u-lars Thus the sperm whale and the hump-backed whale each has a hump but there the simil-i-tude ceas-es Then this same hump-backed whale and the Green-land whale each of the-se has baleen but there again the simil-i-tude ceas-es And it is just the same with the oth-er parts above men-tioned In var-i-ous sorts of whales they form such ir-reg-u-lar com-bi-na-tions or in the case of any one of them de-tached such an ir-reg-u-lar iso-la-tion as ut-ter-ly to de-fy all gen-er-al meth-od-iza-tion formed up-on such a ba-sis On this rock ev-ery one of the whale nat-u-ral-ists has split But it may pos-si-bly be con-ceived that in the in-ter-nal parts of the whale in his anato-my there at least we shall be able to hit the right clas-si-fi-ca-tion Nay what thing for ex-am-ple is there in the Green-land whale s anato-my more strik-ing than his baleen Yet we have seen that by his baleen it is im-pos-si-ble cor-rect-ly to clas-si-fy the Green-land whale And if you de-scend in-to the bow-els of the var-i-ous leviathans why there you will not find dis-tinc-tions a fifti-eth part as avail-able to the sys-tem-atiz-er as those ex-ter-nal ones al-ready enu-mer-at-ed What then re-mains noth-ing but to take hold of the whales bod-i-ly in their en-tire lib-er-al vol-ume and bold-ly sort them that way And this is the Bi-b-li-o-graph-i-cal sys-tem here adopt-ed and it is the on-ly one that can pos-si-bly suc-ceed for it alone is prac-ti-ca-ble To pro-ceed BOOK I Fo-lio CHAPTER IV Hump Back  This whale is of-ten seen on the north-ern Amer-i-can coast He has been fre-quent-ly cap-tured there and towed in-to har-bor He has a great pack on him like a ped-dler or you might call him the Ele-phant and Castle whale At any rate the pop-u-lar name for him does not suf-fi-cient-ly dis-tin-guish him since the sperm whale al-so has a hump though a small-er one His oil is not very valu-able He has baleen He is the most game-some and light heart-ed of all the whales mak-ing more gay foam and white wa-ter gen-er-al-ly than any oth-er of them BOOK I Fo-lio CHAPTER V Ra-zor Back  Of this whale lit-tle is known but his name I have seen him at a dis-tance off Cape Horn Of a re-tir-ing na-ture he eludes both hunters and philoso-phers Though no cow-ard he has nev-er yet shown any part of him but his back which ris-es in a long sharp ridge Let him go I know lit-tle more of him nor does any-body else BOOK I Fo-lio CHAPTER VI Sul-phur Bot-tom  Another re-tir-ing gen-tle-man with a brim-stone bel-ly doubtless got by scrap-ing along the Tar-tar-i-an tiles in some of his pro-founder div-ings He is sel-dom seen at least I have nev-er seen him ex-cept in the re-moter south-ern seas and then al-ways at too great a dis-tance to study his coun-te-nance He is nev-er chased he would run away with rope walks of line Prodigies are told of him Adieu Sul-phur Bot-tom I can say noth-ing more that is true of ye nor can the old-est Nan-tuck-eter Thus ends BOOK I Fo-lio and now be-gins BOOK II Oc-tavo OCTAVOES  Th-e-se em-brace the whales of mid-dling mag-ni-tude among which pre-sent may be num-bered  I the Gram-pus II the Black Fish III the Nar-whale IV the Thrash-er V the Killer Why this book of whales is not de-nom-i-nat-ed the Quar-to is very plain Be-cause while the whales of this or-der though small-er than those of the for-mer or-der nev-er-the-less re-tain a pro-por-tion-ate like-ness to them in fig-ure yet the book-binder s Quar-to vol-ume in its di-men-sioned form does not pre-serve the shape of the Fo-lio vol-ume but the Oc-tavo vol-ume does BOOK II Oc-tavo CHAPTER I Gram-pus  Though this fish whose loud sonorous breath-ing or rather blow-ing has fur-nished a proverb to lands-men is so well known a denizen of the deep yet is he not pop-u-lar-ly classed among whales But pos-sess-ing all the grand dis-tinc-tive fea-tures of the leviathan most nat-u-ral-ists have recog-nised him for one He is of mod-er-ate oc-tavo size vary-ing from fif-teen to twen-ty five feet in length and of cor-re-spond-ing di-men-sions round the waist He swims in herds he is nev-er reg-u-lar-ly hunt-ed though his oil is con-sid-er-able in quan-ti-ty and pret-ty good for light By some fish-er-men his ap-proach is re-gard-ed as pre-mon-i-to-ry of the ad-vance of the great sperm whale BOOK II Oc-tavo CHAPTER II Black Fish  I give the pop-u-lar fish-er-men s names for all the-se fish for gen-er-al-ly they are the best Where any name hap-pens to be vague or in-ex-pres-sive I shall say so and sug-gest an-oth-er I do so now touch-ing the Black Fish so called be-cause black-ness is the rule among al-most all whales So call him the Hye-na Whale if you please His vo-rac-i-ty is well known and from the cir-cum-stance that the in-ner an-gles of his lips are curved up-wards he car-ries an ev-er-last-ing Mephistophe-lean grin on his face This whale av-er-ages some six-teen or eigh-teen feet in length He is found in al-most all lat-i-tudes He has a pe-cu-liar way of show-ing his dor-sal hooked fin in swim-ming which looks some-thing like a Ro-man nose When not more prof-itably em-ployed the sperm whale hunters some-times cap-ture the Hye-na whale to keep up the sup-ply of cheap oil for do-mes-tic em-ploy-men-t as some fru-gal house-keep-ers in the ab-sence of com-pa-ny and quite alone by them-selves burn un-sa-vory tal-low in-stead of odor-ous wax Though their blub-ber is very thin some of the-se whales will yield you up-wards of thir-ty gal-lons of oil BOOK II Oc-tavo CHAPTER III Nar-whale that is Nostril whale  Another in-stance of a cu-ri-ous-ly named whale so named I sup-pose from his pe-cu-liar horn be-ing orig-i-nal-ly mis-tak-en for a peaked nose The crea-ture is some six-teen feet in length while its horn av-er-ages five feet though some ex-ceed ten and even at-tain to fif-teen feet Strict-ly speak-ing this horn is but a length-ened tusk grow-ing out from the jaw in a line a lit-tle de-pressed from the hor-i-zon-tal But it is on-ly found on the sin-is-ter side which has an ill ef-fect giv-ing its own-er some-thing anal-o-gous to the as-pect of a clum-sy left hand-ed man What pre-cise pur-pose this ivory horn or lance an-swers it would be hard to say It does not seem to be used like the blade of the sword fish and bill fish though some sailors tell me that the Nar-whale em-ploys it for a rake in turn-ing over the bot-tom of the sea for food Charley Coffin said it was used for an ice piercer for the Nar-whale ris-ing to the sur-face of the Po-lar Sea and find-ing it sheet-ed with ice thrusts his horn up and so breaks through But you can-not prove ei-ther of the-se sur-mis-es to be cor-rect My own opin-ion is that how-ev-er this one sid-ed horn may re-al-ly be used by the Nar-whale how-ev-er that may be it would cer-tain-ly be very con-ve-nient to him for a fold-er in read-ing pam-phlets The Nar-whale I have heard called the Tusked whale the Horned whale and the Uni-corn whale He is cer-tain-ly a cu-ri-ous ex-am-ple of the Uni-cor-nism to be found in al-most ev-ery king-dom of an-i-mat-ed na-ture From cer-tain clois-tered old au-thors I have gath-ered that this same sea uni-corn s horn was in an-cient days re-gard-ed as the great an-ti-dote again-st poi-son and as such prepa-ra-tions of it brought im-mense prices It was al-so dis-tilled to a volatile salts for faint-ing ladies the same way that the horns of the male deer are man-u-fac-tured in-to hartshorn Orig-i-nal-ly it was in it-self ac-count-ed an ob-ject of great cu-rios-i-ty Black Let-ter tel-ls me that Sir Mart-in Fro-bish-er on his re-turn from that voy-age when Queen Bess did gal-lant-ly wave her jew-elled hand to him from a win-dow of Green-wich Palace as his bold ship sailed down the Thames  when Sir Mart-in re-turned from that voy-age  saith Black Let-ter  on bend-ed knees he pre-sent-ed to her high-ness a prodi-gious long horn of the Nar-whale which for a long pe-ri-od af-ter hung in the castle at Wind-sor  An Ir-ish au-thor avers that the Earl of Le-ices-ter on bend-ed knees did like-wise pre-sent to her high-ness an-oth-er horn per-tain-ing to a land beast of the uni-corn na-ture The Nar-whale has a very pic-turesque leop-ard like look be-ing of a milk white ground colour dot-ted with round and ob-long spots of black His oil is very su-pe-ri-or clear and fine but there is lit-tle of it and he is sel-dom hunt-ed He is most-ly found in the cir-cum-po-lar seas BOOK II Oc-tavo CHAPTER IV Killer  Of this whale lit-tle is pre-cise-ly known to the Nan-tuck-eter and noth-ing at all to the pro-fessed nat-u-ral-ist From what I have seen of him at a dis-tance I should say that he was about the big-ness of a gram-pus He is very sav-age a sort of Feegee fish He some-times takes the great Fo-lio whales by the lip and hangs there like a leech till the mighty brute is wor-ried to death The Killer is nev-er hunt-ed I nev-er heard what sort of oil he has Ex-cep-tion might be tak-en to the name be-stowed up-on this whale on the ground of its in-dis-tinct-ness For we are all killers on land and on sea Bon-a-partes and Sharks in-clud-ed BOOK II Oc-tavo CHAPTER V Thrash-er  This gen-tle-man is fa-mous for his tail which he us-es for a fer-ule in thrash-ing his foes He moun-ts the Fo-lio whale s back and as he swims he works his pas-sage by flog-ging him as some school-mas-ters get along in the world by a sim-i-lar pro-cess Still less is known of the Thrash-er than of the Killer Both are out-laws even in the law-less seas Thus ends BOOK II Oc-tavo and be-gins BOOK III Duodec-i-mo DUODECIMOES  Th-e-se in-clude the small-er whales I The Huz-za Por-poise II The Al-ger-ine Por-poise III The Mealy mouthed Por-poise To those who have not chanced spe-cial-ly to study the sub-ject it may pos-si-bly seem strange that fish-es not com-mon-ly ex-ceed-ing four or five feet should be mar-shalled among WHALES a word which in the pop-u-lar sense al-ways con-veys an idea of huge-ness But the crea-tures set down above as Duodec-i-moes are in-fal-li-bly whales by the ter-ms of my def-i-ni-tion of what a whale is i e a spout-ing fish with a hor-i-zon-tal tail BOOK III Duodec-i-mo CHAPTER 1 Huz-za Por-poise  This is the com-mon por-poise found al-most all over the globe The name is of my own be-stowal for there are more than one sort of por-pois-es and some-thing must be done to dis-tin-guish them I call him thus be-cause he al-ways swims in hi-lar-i-ous shoals which up-on the broad sea keep toss-ing them-selves to heav-en like caps in a Fourth of Ju-ly crowd Their ap-pear-ance is gen-er-al-ly hailed with de-light by the mariner Full of fine spir-its they in-vari-ably come from the breezy bil-lows to wind-ward They are the lads that al-ways live be-fore the wind They are ac-count-ed a lucky omen If you your-self can with-stand three cheers at be-hold-ing the-se vi-va-cious fish then heav-en help ye the spir-it of god-ly game-some-ness is not in ye A well fed plump Huz-za Por-poise will yield you one good gal-lon of good oil But the fine and del-i-cate flu-id ex-tract-ed from his jaws is ex-ceed-ing-ly valu-able It is in re-quest among jew-ellers and watch-mak-ers Sailors put it on their hones Por-poise meat is good eat-ing you know It may nev-er have oc-curred to you that a por-poise spouts In-deed his spout is so small that it is not very read-i-ly dis-cernible But the next time you have a chance watch him and you will then see the great Sperm whale him-self in minia-ture BOOK III Duodec-i-mo CHAPTER II Al-ger-ine Por-poise  A pi-rate Very sav-age He is on-ly found I think in the Paci-fic He is some-what larg-er than the Huz-za Por-poise but much of the same gen-er-al make Pro-voke him and he will buck-le to a shark I have low-ered for him many times but nev-er yet saw him cap-tured BOOK III Duodec-i-mo CHAPTER III Mealy mouthed Por-poise  The largest kind of Por-poise and on-ly found in the Paci-fic so far as it is known The on-ly English name by which he has hith-er-to been des-ig-nat-ed is that of the fish-er-s Right Whale Por-poise from the cir-cum-stance that he is chiefly found in the vicin-i-ty of that Fo-lio In shape he dif-fers in some de-gree from the Huz-za Por-poise be-ing of a less ro-tund and jol-ly girth in-deed he is of quite a neat and gen-tle-man like fig-ure He has no fins on his back most oth-er por-pois-es have he has a love-ly tail and sen-ti-men-tal In-di-an eyes of a hazel hue But his mealy mouth spoils all Though his en-tire back down to his side fins is of a deep sable yet a bound-ary line dis-tinct as the mark in a ship s hull called the  bright waist  that line streaks him from stem to stern with two sep-a-rate colours black above and white be-low The white com-pris-es part of his head and the whole of his mouth which makes him look as if he had just es-caped from a felo-nious vis-it to a meal bag A most mean and mealy as-pect His oil is much like that of the com-mon por-poise Beyond the DUODECIMO this sys-tem does not pro-ceed inas-much as the Por-poise is the small-est of the whales Above you have all the Le-viathans of note But there are a rab-ble of un-cer-tain fugi-tive half fab-u-lous whales which as an Amer-i-can whale-man I know by rep-u-ta-tion but not per-son-al-ly I shall enu-mer-ate them by their fore castle ap-pel-la-tions for pos-si-bly such a list may be valu-able to fu-ture in-ves-ti-ga-tors who may com-plete what I have here but be-gun If any of the fol-low-ing whales shall here-after be caught and marked then he can read-i-ly be in-cor-po-rat-ed in-to this Sys-tem ac-cord-ing to his Fo-lio Oc-tavo or Duodec-i-mo

Whale the Quog Whale the Blue Whale etc From Ice-landic Dutch and old English au-thor-i-ties there might be quot-ed oth-er lists of un-cer-tain whales blessed with all man-ner of un-couth names But I omit them as al-to-geth-er ob-so-lete and can hard-ly help sus-pect-ing them for mere sounds full of Le-viathanism but sig-ni-fy-ing noth-ing Fi-nal-ly It was stat-ed at the out-set that this sys-tem would not be here and at on-ce per-fect-ed You can-not but plain-ly see that I have kept my word But I now leave my ce-to-log-i-cal Sys-tem stand-ing thus un-fin-ished even as the great Cathe-dral of

Speck-sny-der Con-cern-ing the of-fi-cers of the whale craft this seems as good a place as any to set down a lit-tle do-mes-tic pe-cu-liar-i-ty on ship board aris-ing from the ex-is-tence of the har-pooneer class of of-fi-cers a class un-known of course in any oth-er marine than the whale fleet The large im-por-tance at-tached to the har-pooneer s vo-ca-tion is evinced by the fact that orig-i-nal-ly in the old Dutch Fish-ery two cen-turies and more ago the com-mand of a whale ship was not whol-ly lodged in the per-son now called the cap-tain but was di-vid-ed be-tween him and an of-fi-cer called the Speck-sny-der Lit-er-al-ly this word means Fat Cut-ter us-age how-ev-er in time made it equiv-a-lent to Chief Har-pooneer In those days the cap-tain s au-thor-i-ty was re-strict-ed to the nav-i-ga-tion and gen-er-al man-age-ment of the ves-sel while over the whale hunt-ing de-part-ment and all its con-cerns the Speck-sny-der or Chief Har-pooneer reigned supre-me In the Bri-tish Green-land Fish-ery un-der the cor-rupt-ed ti-tle of Speck-sioneer this old Dutch of-fi-cial is still re-tained but his for-mer dig-ni-ty is sad-ly abridged At pre-sent he ranks sim-ply as se-nior Har-pooneer and as such is but one of the cap-tain s more in-fe-ri-or sub-al-terns Nev-er-the-less as up-on the good con-duct of the har-pooneers the suc-cess of a whal-ing voy-age large-ly de-pends and since in the Amer-i-can Fish-ery he is not on-ly an im-por-tant of-fi-cer in the boat but un-der cer-tain cir-cum-stances night watch-es on a whal-ing ground the com-mand of the ship s deck is al-so his there-fore the grand po-lit-i-cal max-im of the sea de-mands that he should nom-i-nal-ly live apart from the men be-fore the mast and be in some way dis-tin-guished as their pro-fes-sion-al su-pe-ri-or though al-ways by them fa-mil-iar-ly re-gard-ed as their so-cial equal Now the grand dis-tinc-tion drawn be-tween of-fi-cer and man at sea is this the first lives aft the last for-ward Hence in whale ships and mer-chant-men alike the mates have their quar-ters with the cap-tain and so too in most of the Amer-i-can whalers the har-pooneers are lodged in the af-ter part of the ship That is to say they take their meals in the cap-tain s cab-in and sleep in a place in-di-rect-ly com-mu-ni-cat-ing with it Though the long pe-ri-od of a South-ern whal-ing voy-age by far the longest of all voy-ages now or ev-er made by man the pe-cu-liar per-ils of it and the com-mu-ni-ty of in-ter-est pre-vail-ing among a com-pa-ny all of whom high or low de-pend for their prof-its not up-on fixed wages but up-on their com-mon luck to-geth-er with their com-mon vig-i-lance in-tre-pid-i-ty and hard work though all the-se things do in some cas-es tend to beget a less rig-or-ous dis-ci-pline than in mer-chant-men gen-er-al-ly yet nev-er mind how much like an old Me-sopotami-an fam-i-ly the-se whale-men may in some prim-i-tive in-stances live to-geth-er for all that the punc-til-ious ex-ter-nals at least of the quar-ter deck are sel-dom ma-te-ri-al-ly re-laxed and in no in-stance done away In-deed many are the Nan-tuck-et ships in which you will see the skip-per parad-ing his quar-ter deck with an elat-ed grandeur not sur-passed in any mil-i-tary navy nay ex-tort-ing al-most as much out-ward homage as if he wore the im-pe-ri-al pur-ple and not the shab-bi-est of pi-lot cloth And though of all men the moody cap-tain of the Pe-quod was the least given to that sort of shal-low-est as-sump-tion and though the on-ly homage he ev-er ex-act-ed was im-plic-it in-stan-ta-neous obe-di-ence though he re-quired no man to re-move the shoes from his feet ere step-ping up-on the quar-ter deck and though there were times when ow-ing to pe-cu-liar cir-cum-stances con-nect-ed with even-ts here-after to be de-tailed he ad-dressed them in un-usu-al ter-ms whether of con-de-scen-sion or in ter-rorem or oth-er-wise yet even Cap-tain Ahab was by no means un-ob-ser-vant of the paramount for-ms and us-ages of the sea Nor per-haps will it fail to be even-tu-al-ly per-ceived that be-hind those for-ms and us-ages as it were he some-times masked him-self in-ci-den-tal-ly mak-ing use of them for oth-er and more pri-vate ends than they were le-git-i-mate-ly in-tend-ed to sub-serve That cer-tain sul-tanism of his brain which had oth-er-wise in a good de-gree re-mained un-man-i-fest-ed through those for-ms that same sul-tanism be-came in-car-nate in an ir-re-sistible dic-ta-tor-ship For be a man s in-tel-lec-tu-al su-pe-ri-or-i-ty what it will it can nev-er as-sume the prac-ti-cal avail-able suprema-cy over oth-er men with-out the aid of some sort of ex-ter-nal arts and en-trench-men-ts al-ways in them-selves more or less pal-try and base This it is that for ev-er keeps God s true princes of the Em-pire from the world s hus-tings and leaves the high-est hon-ors that this air can give to those men who be-come fa-mous more through their in-finite in-fe-ri-or-i-ty to the choice hid-den hand-ful of the Divine In-ert than through their un-doubt-ed su-pe-ri-or-i-ty over the dead lev-el of the mass Such large virtue lurks in the-se small things when ex-treme po-lit-i-cal su-per-sti-tions in-vest them that in some roy-al in-stances even to id-iot im-be-cil-i-ty they have im-part-ed po-ten-cy But when as in the case of Ni-cholas the Czar the ringed crown of ge-o-graph-i-cal em-pire en-cir-cles an im-pe-ri-al brain then the ple-beian herds crouch abased be-fore the tremen-dous cen-tral-iza-tion Nor will the trag-ic drama-tist who would de-pict mor-tal in-domitable-ness in its fullest sweep and di-rect swing ev-er for-get a hint in-ci-den-tal-ly so im-por-tant in his art as the one now al-lud-ed to But Ahab my Cap-tain still moves be-fore me in all his Nan-tuck-et grim-ness and shag-gi-ness and in this episode touch-ing Em-per-ors and Kings I must not con-ceal that I have on-ly to do with a poor old whale hunter like him and there-fore all out-ward ma-jes-ti-cal trap-pings and hous-ings are de-nied me Oh Ahab what shall be grand in thee it must needs be plucked at from the skies and dived for in the deep and fea-tured in the un-bod-ied air CHAPTER 34 The Cabin Table It is noon and Dough Boy the stew-ard thrust-ing his pale loaf of bread face from the cab-in scut-tle an-nounces din-ner to his lord and mas-ter who sit-ting in the lee quar-ter boat has just been tak-ing an ob-ser-va-tion of the sun and is now mute-ly reck-on-ing the lat-i-tude on the smooth medal-lion shaped tablet re-served for that dai-ly pur-pose on the up-per part of his ivory leg From his com-plete inat-ten-tion to the tid-ings you would think that moody Ahab had not heard his me-nial But present-ly catch-ing hold of the mizen shrouds he swings him-self to the deck and in an even un-ex-hil-a-rat-ed voice say-ing  Din-ner Mr Star-buck  dis-ap-pears in-to the cab-in When the last echo of his sul-tan s step has died away and Star-buck the first Emir has ev-ery rea-son to sup-pose that he is seat-ed then Star-buck rous-es from his qui-etude takes a few turns along the planks and af-ter a grave peep in-to the bin-na-cle says with some touch of pleas-ant-ness  Din-ner Mr Stubb  and de-scends the scut-tle The sec-ond Emir lounges about the rig-ging awhile and then slight-ly shak-ing the main brace to see whether it will be all right with that im-por-tant rope he like-wise takes up the old bur-den and with a rapid  Din-ner Mr Flask  fol-lows af-ter his pre-de-ces-sors But the third Emir now see-ing him-self all alone on the quar-ter deck seems to feel re-lieved from some cu-ri-ous re-straint for tip-ping all sorts of know-ing winks in all sorts of di-rec-tions and kick-ing off his shoes he strikes in-to a sharp but noise-less squall of a horn-pipe right over the Grand Turk s head and then by a dex-ter-ous sleight pitch-ing his cap up in-to the mizen-top for a shelf he goes down rol-lick-ing so far at least as he re-mains vis-i-ble from the deck re-vers-ing all oth-er pro-ces-sions by bring-ing up the rear with mu-sic But ere step-ping in-to the cab-in door-way be-low he paus-es ships a new face al-to-geth-er and then in-de-pen-dent hi-lar-i-ous lit-tle Flask en-ters King Ahab s pres-ence in the char-ac-ter of Ab-jec-tus or the Slave It is not the least among the strange things bred by the in-tense ar-ti-fi-cial-ness of sea us-ages that while in the open air of the deck some of-fi-cers will up-on provo-ca-tion bear them-selves bold-ly and de-fy-ing-ly enough to-wards their com-man-der yet ten to one let those very of-fi-cers the next mo-ment go down to their cus-tom-ary din-ner in that same com-man-der s cab-in and straight-way their in-of-fen-sive not to say dep-re-ca-to-ry and hum-ble air to-wards him as he sits at the head of the table this is mar-vel-lous some-times most com-i-cal Where-fore this dif-fer-ence A prob-lem Per-haps not To have been Bels-haz-zar King of Baby-lon and to have been Bels-haz-zar not haugh-ti-ly but cour-te-ous-ly there-in cer-tain-ly must have been some touch of mun-dane grandeur But he who in the right-ly re-gal and in-tel-li-gent spir-it pre-sides over his own pri-vate din-ner table of in-vit-ed guests that man s un-chal-lenged pow-er and do-min-ion of in-di-vid-u-al in-flu-ence for the time that man s roy-al-ty of state tran-scends Bels-haz-zar s for Bels-haz-zar was not the great-est Who has but on-ce dined his friends has tast-ed what it is to be C sar It is a witch-ery of so-cial czar-ship which there is no with-stand-ing Now if to this con-sid-er-a-tion you su-per-add the of-fi-cial suprema-cy of a ship mas-ter then by in-fer-ence you will de-rive the cause of that pe-cu-liar-i-ty of sea life just men-tioned Over his ivory in-laid table Ahab presid-ed like a mute maned sea li-on on the white coral beach sur-round-ed by his war-like but still def-er-en-tial cubs In his own prop-er turn each of-fi-cer wait-ed to be served They were as lit-tle chil-dren be-fore Ahab and yet in Ahab there seemed not to lurk the small-est so-cial ar-ro-gance With one mind their in-tent eyes all fas-tened up-on the old man s knife as he carved the chief dish be-fore him I do not sup-pose that for the world they would have pro-faned that mo-ment with the slight-est ob-ser-va-tion even up-on so neu-tral a top-ic as the weath-er No And when reach-ing out his knife and fork be-tween which the slice of beef was locked Ahab there-by mo-tioned Star-buck s plate to-wards him the mate re-ceived his meat as though re-ceiv-ing alms and cut it ten-der-ly and a lit-tle start-ed if per-chance the knife grazed again-st the plate and chewed it noise-less-ly and swal-lowed it not with-out cir-cum-spec-tion For like the Corona-tion ban-quet at Frank-fort where the Ger-man Em-per-or pro-found-ly di-nes with the sev-en Im-pe-ri-al Elec-tors so the-se cab-in meals were some-how solemn meals eat-en in aw-ful si-lence and yet at table old Ahab for-bade not con-ver-sa-tion on-ly he him-self was dumb What a re-lief it was to chok-ing Stubb when a rat made a sud-den rack-et in the hold be-low And poor lit-tle Flask he was the youngest son and lit-tle boy of this weary fam-i-ly par-ty His were the shin-bones of the saline beef his would have been the drum-sticks For Flask to have pre-sumed to help him-self this must have seemed to him tan-ta-mount to larceny in the first de-gree Had he helped him-self at that table doubtless nev-er more would he have been able to hold his head up in this hon-est world nev-er-the-less strange to say Ahab nev-er for-bade him And had Flask helped him-self the chances were Ahab had nev-er so much as no-ticed it Least of all did Flask pre-sume to help him-self to but-ter Whether he thought the own-ers of the ship de-nied it to him on ac-count of its clot-ting his clear sun-ny com-plex-ion or whether he deemed that on so long a voy-age in such mar-ket-less wa-ters but-ter was at a pre-mi-um and there-fore was not for him a sub-al-tern how-ev-er it was Flask alas was a but-ter-less man Another thing Flask was the last per-son down at the din-ner and Flask is the first man up Con-sid-er For here-by Flask s din-ner was bad-ly jammed in point of time Star-buck and Stubb both had the start of him and yet they al-so have the priv-i-lege of loung-ing in the rear If Stubb even who is but a peg high-er than Flask hap-pens to have but a small ap-petite and soon shows symp-toms of con-clud-ing his repast then Flask must be-stir him-self he will not get more than three mouth-fuls that day for it is again-st holy us-age for Stubb to pre-cede Flask to the deck There-fore it was that Flask on-ce ad-mit-ted in pri-vate that ev-er since he had arisen to the dig-ni-ty of an of-fi-cer from that mo-ment he had nev-er known what it was to be oth-er-wise than hun-gry more or less For what he ate did not so much re-lieve his hunger as keep it im-mor-tal in him Peace and sat-is-fac-tion thought Flask have for ev-er de-part-ed from my stom-ach I am an of-fi-cer but how I wish I could fish a bit of old fash-ioned beef in the fore-castle as I used to when I was be-fore the mast There s the fruits of pro-mo-tion now there s the van-i-ty of glo-ry there s the in-san-i-ty of life Be-sides if it were so that any mere sailor of the Pe-quod had a grudge again-st Flask in Flask s of-fi-cial ca-pac-i-ty all that sailor had to do in or-der to ob-tain am-ple vengeance was to go aft at din-ner time and get a peep at Flask through the cab-in sky light sit-ting sil-ly and dum-foundered be-fore aw-ful Ahab Now Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table in the Pe-quod s cab-in After their de-par-ture tak-ing place in in-vert-ed or-der to their ar-rival the can-vas cloth was cleared or rather was re-stored to some hur-ried or-der by the pal-lid stew-ard And then the three har-pooneers were bid-den to the feast they be-ing its resid-uary lega-tees They made a sort of tem-po-rary ser-vants hall of the high and mighty cab-in In strange con-trast to the hard-ly tol-er-a-ble con-straint and name-less in-vis-i-ble dom-i-neer-ings of the cap-tain s table was the en-tire care free li-cense and ease the al-most fran-tic democ-ra-cy of those in-fe-ri-or fel-lows the har-pooneers While their mas-ters the mates seemed afraid of the sound of the hinges of their own jaws the har-pooneers chewed their food with such a rel-ish that there was a re-port to it They dined like lords they filled their bel-lies like In-di-an ships all day load-ing with spices Such por-ten-tous ap-petites had Quee-queg and Tashte-go that to fill out the va-can-cies made by the pre-vi-ous repast of-ten the pale Dough Boy was fain to bring on a great baron of salt junk seem-ing-ly quar-ried out of the solid ox And if he were not live-ly about it if he did not go with a nim-ble hop skip and jump then Tashte-go had an un-gentle-man-ly way of ac-cel-er-at-ing him by dart-ing a fork at his back har-poon wise And on-ce Dag-goo seized with a sud-den hu-mor as-sist-ed Dough Boy s mem-o-ry by snatch-ing him up bod-i-ly and thrust-ing his head in-to a great emp-ty wood-en trencher while Tashte-go knife in hand be-gan lay-ing out the cir-cle pre-lim-i-nary to scalp-ing him He was nat-u-ral-ly a very ner-vous shud-der-ing sort of lit-tle fel-low this bread faced stew-ard the progeny of a bankrupt bak-er and a hos-pi-tal nurse And what with the stand-ing spec-ta-cle of the black ter-ri-fic Ahab and the pe-ri-od-i-cal tu-mul-tuous vis-i-ta-tions of the-se three sav-ages Dough Boy s whole life was one con-tin-u-al lip quiv-er Com-mon-ly af-ter see-ing the har-pooneers fur-nished with all things they de-mand-ed he would es-cape from their clutch-es in-to his lit-tle pantry ad-join-ing and fear-ful-ly peep out at them through the blinds of its door till all was over It was a sight to see Quee-queg seat-ed over again-st Tashte-go op-pos-ing his filed teeth to the In-di-an s cross-wise to them Dag-goo seat-ed on the floor for a bench would have brought his hearse plumed head to the low car-li-nes at ev-ery mo-tion of his colos-sal lim-bs mak-ing the low cab-in frame-work to shake as when an African ele-phant goes pas-sen-ger in a ship But for all this the great ne-gro was won-der-ful-ly ab-stemious not to say dain-ty It seemed hard-ly pos-si-ble that by such com-par-a-tive-ly small mouth-fuls he could keep up the vi-tal-i-ty dif-fused through so broad ba-ro-nial and su-perb a per-son But doubtless this no-ble sav-age fed strong and drank deep of the abound-ing el-e-ment of air and through his di-lat-ed nos-trils snuffed in the sub-lime life of the worlds Not by beef or by bread are gi-ants made or nour-ished But Quee-queg he had a mor-tal bar-bar-ic smack of the lip in eat-ing an ug-ly sound enough so much so that the trem-bling Dough Boy al-most looked to see whether any marks of teeth lurked in his own lean ar-ms And when he would hear Tashte-go singing out for him to pro-duce him-self that his bones might be picked the sim-ple wit-ted stew-ard all but shat-tered the crock-ery hang-ing round him in the pantry by his sud-den fits of the pal-sy Nor did the whet-stone which the har-pooneers car-ried in their pock-ets for their lances and oth-er weapons and with which whet-stones at din-ner they would os-ten-ta-tious-ly sharp-en their knives that grat-ing sound did not at all tend to tran-quil-lize poor Dough Boy How could he for-get that in his Is-land days Quee-queg for one must cer-tain-ly have been guilty of some mur-der-ous con-vivial in-dis-cre-tions Alas Dough Boy hard fares the white wait-er who waits up-on can-ni-bals Not a nap-kin should he car-ry on his arm but a buck-ler In good time though to his great de-light the three salt sea war-riors would rise and de-part to his cred-u-lous fa-ble mon-ger-ing ears all their mar-tial bones jin-gling in them at ev-ery step like Moor-ish scimetars in scab-bards But though the-se bar-bar-ians dined in the cab-in and nom-i-nal-ly lived there still be-ing any-thing but seden-tary in their habits they were scarce-ly ev-er in it ex-cept at meal-times and just be-fore sleep-ing time when they passed through it to their own pe-cu-liar quar-ters In this one mat-ter Ahab seemed no ex-cep-tion to most Amer-i-can whale cap-tains who as a set rather in-cline to the opin-ion that by rights the ship s cab-in be-longs to them and that it is by cour-tesy alone that any-body else is at any time per-mit-ted there So that in re-al truth the mates and har-pooneers of the Pe-quod might more prop-er-ly be said to have lived out of the cab-in than in it For when they did en-ter it it was some-thing as a street door en-ters a house turn-ing in-wards for a mo-ment on-ly to be turned out the next and as a per-ma-nent thing re-sid-ing in the open air Nor did they lose much here-by in the cab-in was no com-pan-ion-ship so-cial-ly Ahab was in-ac-ces-si-ble Though nom-i-nal-ly in-clud-ed in the cen-sus of Chris-ten-dom he was still an alien to it He lived in the world as the last of the Gris-ly Bears lived in set-tled Mis-souri And as when Spring and Sum-mer had de-part-ed that wild Lo-gan of the woods bury-ing him-self in the hol-low of a tree lived out the win-ter there suck-ing his own paws so in his in-clement howl-ing old age Ahab s soul shut up in the caved trunk of his body there fed up-on the sul-len paws of its gloom CHAPTER 35 The Mast Head It was dur-ing the more pleas-ant weath-er that in due ro-ta-tion with the oth-er sea-men my first mast head came round In most Amer-i-can whale-men the mast heads are manned al-most si-mul-ta-ne-ous-ly with the ves-sel s leav-ing her port even though she may have fif-teen thou-sand miles and more to sail ere reach-ing her prop-er cruis-ing ground And if af-ter a three four or five years voy-age she is draw-ing nigh home with any-thing emp-ty in her say an emp-ty vial even then her mast heads are kept manned to the last and not till her sky-sail poles sail in among the spires of the port does she al-to-geth-er re-lin-quish the hope of cap-tur-ing one whale more Now as the busi-ness of stand-ing mast heads ashore or afloat is a very an-cient and in-ter-est-ing one let us in some mea-sure ex-pa-ti-ate here I take it that the ear-li-est standers of mast heads were the old Egyp-tians be-cause in all my re-search-es I find none pri-or to them For though their pro-gen-i-tors the builders of Ba-bel must doubtless by their tow-er have in-tend-ed to rear the lofti-est mast head in all Asia or Africa ei-ther yet ere the fi-nal truck was put to it as that great stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board in the dread gale of God s wrath there-fore we can-not give the-se Ba-bel builders pri-or-i-ty over the Egyp-tians And that the Egyp-tians were a na-tion of mast head standers is an as-ser-tion based up-on the gen-er-al be-lief among arch ol-o-gists that the first pyra-mids were found-ed for as-tro-nom-i-cal pur-pos-es a the-o-ry sin-gu-lar-ly sup-port-ed by the pe-cu-liar stair like for-ma-tion of all four sides of those ed-i-fices where-by with prodi-gious long up-lift-ings of their legs those old as-tronomers were wont to mount to the apex and sing out for new stars even as the look outs of a mod-ern ship sing out for a sail or a whale just bear-ing in sight In Saint Stylites the fa-mous Chris-tian her-mit of old times who built him a lofty stone pil-lar in the de-sert and spent the whole lat-ter por-tion of his life on its sum-mit hoist-ing his food from the ground with a tack-le in him we have a re-mark-able in-stance of a daunt-less stander of mast heads who was not to be driven from his place by fogs or frosts rain hail or sleet but valiant-ly fac-ing ev-ery-thing out to the last lit-er-al-ly died at his post Of mod-ern standers of mast heads we have but a life-less set mere stone iron and bronze men who though well ca-pa-ble of fac-ing out a stiff gale are still en-tire-ly in-com-pe-tent to the busi-ness of singing out up-on dis-cov-er-ing any strange sight There is Napoleon who up-on the top of the column of Ven-dome stands with ar-ms fold-ed some one hun-dred and fifty feet in the air care-less now who rules the decks be-low whether Louis Philippe Louis Blanc or Louis the Devil Great Wash-ing-ton too stands high aloft on his tow-er-ing main mast in Bal-ti-more and like one of Her-cules pil-lars his column marks that point of hu-man grandeur be-yond which few mor-tals will go Ad-mi-ral Nel-son al-so on a cap-stan of gun met-al stands his mast head in Trafal-gar Square and ev-er when most ob-scured by that Lon-don smoke to-ken is yet given that a hid-den hero is there for where there is smoke must be fire But nei-ther great Wash-ing-ton nor Napoleon nor Nel-son will an-swer a sin-gle hail from be-low how-ev-er mad-ly in-voked to be-friend by their coun-sels the dis-tract-ed decks up-on which they gaze how-ev-er it may be sur-mised that their spir-its pen-e-trate through the thick haze of the fu-ture and de-scry what shoals and what rocks must be shunned It may seem un-war-rantable to cou-ple in any re-spect the mast head standers of the land with those of the sea but that in truth it is not so is plain-ly evinced by an item for which Obed Ma-cy the sole his-to-ri-an of Nan-tuck-et stands ac-count-able The wor-thy Obed tel-ls us that in the ear-ly times of the whale fish-ery ere ships were reg-u-lar-ly launched in pur-suit of the game the peo-ple of that is-land erect-ed lofty spars along the sea coast to which the look outs as-cend-ed by means of nailed cleats some-thing as fowls go up-stairs in a hen house A few years ago this same plan was adopt-ed by the Bay whale-men of New Zealand who up-on de-scry-ing the game gave no-tice to the ready manned boats nigh the beach But this cus-tom has now be-come ob-so-lete turn we then to the one prop-er mast head that of a whale ship at sea The three mast heads are kept manned from sun rise to sun set the sea-men tak-ing their reg-u-lar turns as at the helm and re-liev-ing each oth-er ev-ery two hours In the serene weath-er of the trop-ics it is ex-ceed-ing-ly pleas-ant the mast head nay to a dreamy med-i-ta-tive man it is de-light-ful There you stand a hun-dred feet above the silent decks strid-ing along the deep as if the mas-ts were gi-gan-tic stilts while be-neath you and be-tween your legs as it were swim the hugest mon-sters of the sea even as ships on-ce sailed be-tween the boots of the fa-mous Colos-sus at old Rhodes There you stand lost in the in-finite se-ries of the sea with noth-ing ruf-fled but the waves The tranced ship in-do-lent-ly rol-ls the drowsy trade winds blow ev-ery-thing re-solves you in-to lan-guor For the most part in this trop-ic whal-ing life a sub-lime un-event-ful-ness in-vests you you hear no news read no gazettes ex-tras with startling ac-coun-ts of com-mon-places nev-er de-lude you in-to un-nec-es-sary ex-cite-men-ts you hear of no do-mes-tic af-flic-tions bankrupt se-cu-ri-ties fall of stocks are nev-er trou-bled with the thought of what you shall have for din-ner for all your meals for three years and more are snug-ly stowed in casks and your bill of fare is im-mutable In one of those south-ern whales-men on a long three or four years voy-age as of-ten hap-pens the sum of the var-i-ous hours you spend at the mast head would amount to sev-er-al en-tire months And it is much to be de-plored that the place to which you de-vote so con-sid-er-able a por-tion of the whole term of your nat-u-ral life should be so sad-ly des-ti-tute of any-thing ap-proach-ing to a cosy in-hab-itive-ness or adapt-ed to breed a com-fort-able lo-cal-ness of feel-ing such as per-tains to a bed a ham-mock a hearse a sen-try box a pul-pit a coach or any oth-er of those small and snug con-trivances in which men tem-porar-i-ly iso-late them-selves Your most usu-al point of per-ch is the head of the t gal-lant mast where you stand up-on two thin par-al-lel sticks al-most pe-cu-liar to whale-men called the t gal-lant cross trees Here tossed about by the sea the be-gin-ner feels about as cosy as he would stand-ing on a bul-l s horns To be sure in cold weath-er you may car-ry your house aloft with you in the shape of a watch coat but prop-er-ly speak-ing the thick-est watch coat is no more of a house than the un-clad body for as the soul is glued in-side of its fleshy taber-na-cle and can-not freely move about in it nor even move out of it with-out run-ning great risk of per-ish-ing like an ig-no-rant pil-grim cross-ing the snowy Alps in win-ter so a watch coat is not so much of a house as it is a mere en-velope or ad-di-tion-al skin en-cas-ing you You can-not put a shelf or chest of draw-ers in your body and no more can you make a con-ve-nient clos-et of your watch coat Con-cern-ing all this it is much to be de-plored that the mast heads of a south-ern whale ship are un-pro-vid-ed with those en-vi-able lit-tle ten-ts or pul-pits called crow s nests in which the look outs of a Green-land whaler are pro-tect-ed from the in-clement weath-er of the frozen seas In the fireside nar-ra-tive of Cap-tain Sleet en-ti-tled  A Voy-age among the Ice-bergs in quest of the Green-land Whale and in-ci-den-tal-ly for the re dis-cov-ery of the Lost Ice-landic Colonies of Old Green-land  in this ad-mirable vol-ume all standers of mast heads are fur-nished with a charm-ing-ly cir-cum-stan-tial ac-count of the then re-cent-ly in-vent-ed crow s nest of the Glacier which was the name of Cap-tain Sleet s good craft He called it the Sleet s crow s nest in hon-or of him-self he be-ing the orig-i-nal in-ven-tor and paten-tee and free from all ridicu-lous false del-i-ca-cy and hold-ing that if we call our own chil-dren af-ter our own names we fa-thers be-ing the orig-i-nal in-ven-tors and paten-tees so like-wise should we de-nom-i-nate af-ter our-selves any oth-er ap-pa-ra-tus we may beget In shape the Sleet s crow s nest is some-thing like a large tierce or pipe it is open above how-ev-er where it is fur-nished with a mov-able side screen to keep to wind-ward of your head in a hard gale Be-ing fixed on the sum-mit of the mast you as-cend in-to it through a lit-tle trap hatch in the bot-tom On the af-ter side or side next the stern of the ship is a com-fort-able seat with a lock-er un-der-neath for um-brel-las com-forters and coats In front is a leather rack in which to keep your speak-ing trum-pet pipe tele-scope and oth-er nau-ti-cal con-ve-niences When Cap-tain Sleet in per-son stood his mast head in this crow s nest of his he tel-ls us that he al-ways had a ri-fle with him al-so fixed in the rack to-geth-er with a pow-der flask and shot for the pur-pose of pop-ping off the stray nar-whales or va-grant sea uni-corns in-fest-ing those wa-ters for you can-not suc-cess-ful-ly shoot at them from the deck ow-ing to the re-sis-tance of the wa-ter but to shoot down up-on them is a very dif-fer-ent thing Now it was plain-ly a labor of love for Cap-tain Sleet to de-scribe as he does all the lit-tle de-tailed con-ve-niences of his crow s nest but though he so en-larges up-on many of the-se and though he treats us to a very sci-en-tific ac-count of his ex-per-i-men-ts in this crow s nest with a small com-pass he kept there for the pur-pose of coun-ter-act-ing the er-rors re-sult-ing from what is called the  lo-cal at-trac-tion of all bin-na-cle mag-nets an er-ror as-crib-able to the hor-i-zon-tal vicin-i-ty of the iron in the ship s planks and in the Glacier s case per-haps to there hav-ing been so many bro-ken down black-smiths among her crew I say that though the Cap-tain is very dis-creet and sci-en-tific here yet for all his learned  bin-na-cle de-vi-a-tions   az-imuth com-pass ob-ser-va-tions  and  ap-prox-i-mate er-rors  he knows very well Cap-tain Sleet that he was not so much im-mersed in those pro-found mag-net-ic med-i-ta-tions as to fail be-ing at-tract-ed oc-ca-sion-al-ly to-wards that well re-plen-ished lit-tle case bot-tle so nice-ly tucked in on one side of his crow s nest with-in easy reach of his hand Though up-on the whole I great-ly ad-mire and even love the brave the hon-est and learned Cap-tain yet I take it very ill of him that he should so ut-ter-ly ig-nore that case bot-tle see-ing what a faith-ful friend and com-forter it must have been while with mit-tened fin-gers and hood-ed head he was study-ing the math-e-mat-ics aloft there in that bird s nest with-in three or four perch-es of the pole But if we South-ern whale fish-ers are not so snug-ly housed aloft as Cap-tain Sleet and his Green-land-men were yet that dis-ad-van-tage is great-ly coun-ter bal-anced by the wide-ly con-trast-ing seren-i-ty of those se-duc-tive seas in which we South fish-ers most-ly float For one I used to lounge up the rig-ging very leisure-ly rest-ing in the top to have a chat with Quee-queg or any one else off du-ty whom I might find there then as-cend-ing a lit-tle way fur-ther and throw-ing a lazy leg over the top sail yard take a pre-lim-i-nary view of the wa-tery pas-tures and so at last mount to my ul-ti-mate des-ti-na-tion Let me make a clean breast of it here and frankly ad-mit that I kept but sor-ry guard With the prob-lem of the uni-verse re-volv-ing in me how could I be-ing left com-plete-ly to my-self at such a thought en-gen-der-ing al-ti-tude how could I but light-ly hold my obli-ga-tions to ob-serve all whale ship-s stand-ing or-ders  Keep your weath-er eye open and sing out ev-ery time  And let me in this place mov-ing-ly ad-mon-ish you ye ship own-ers of Nan-tuck-et Be-ware of en-list-ing in your vig-i-lant fish-eries any lad with lean brow and hol-low eye given to un-sea-son-able med-i-ta-tive-ness and who of-fers to ship with the Ph don in-stead of Bowditch in his head Be-ware of such an one I say your whales must be seen be-fore they can be killed and this sunken eyed young Pla-ton-ist will tow you ten wakes round the world and nev-er make you one pint of sperm the richer Nor are the-se mo-ni-tions at all un-need-ed For nowa-days the whale fish-ery fur-nish-es an asy-lum for many ro-man-tic melan-choly and ab-sent mind-ed young men dis-gust-ed with the cark-ing cares of earth and seek-ing sen-ti-ment in tar and blub-ber Childe Harold not un-fre-quent-ly perch-es him-self up-on the mast head of some luck-less dis-ap-point-ed whale ship and in moody phrase ejac-u-lates   Roll on thou deep and dark blue ocean roll Ten thou-sand blub-ber hunters sweep over thee in vain  Very of-ten do the cap-tains of such ships take those ab-sent mind-ed young philoso-phers to task up-braid-ing them with not feel-ing suf-fi-cient  in-ter-est in the voy-age half hint-ing that they are so hope-less-ly lost to all hon-or-able am-bi-tion as that in their se-cret souls they would rather not see whales than oth-er-wise But all in vain those young Pla-ton-ists have a no-tion that their vi-sion is im-per-fect they are short sight-ed what use then to strain the vi-su-al nerve They have left their op-era glass-es at home  Why thou mon-key  said a har-pooneer to one of the-se lads  we ve been cruis-ing now hard up-on three years and thou hast not raised a whale yet Whales are scarce as hen s teeth when-ev-er thou art up here  Per-haps they were or per-haps there might have been shoals of them in the far hori-zon but lulled in-to such an opi-um like list-less-ness of va-cant un-con-scious rever-ie is this ab-sent mind-ed youth by the blend-ing ca-dence of waves with thoughts that at last he los-es his iden-ti-ty takes the mys-tic ocean at his feet for the vis-i-ble im-age of that deep blue bot-tom-less soul per-vad-ing mankind and na-ture and ev-ery strange half seen glid-ing beau-ti-ful thing that eludes him ev-ery dim-ly dis-cov-ered up-ris-ing fin of some undis-cernible form seems to him the em-bod-i-ment of those elu-sive thoughts that on-ly peo-ple the soul by con-tin-u-al-ly flit-ting through it In this en-chant-ed mood thy spir-it ebbs away to whence it came be-comes dif-fused through time and space like Cran-mer s sprin-kled Pan-the-is-tic ash-es form-ing at last a part of ev-ery shore the round globe over There is no life in thee now ex-cept that rock-ing life im-part-ed by a gen-tly rolling ship by her bor-rowed from the sea by the sea from the in-scrutable tides of God But while this sleep this dream is on ye move your foot or hand an inch slip your hold at all and your iden-ti-ty comes back in hor-ror Over Descar-tian vor-tices you hov-er And per-haps at mid day in the fairest weath-er with one half throt-tled shriek you drop through that trans-par-ent air in-to the sum-mer sea no more to rise for ev-er Heed it well ye Pan-the-ists CHAPTER 36 The Quar-ter Deck En-ter Ahab Then all It was not a great while af-ter the af-fair of the pipe that one morn-ing short-ly af-ter break-fast Ahab as was his wont as-cend-ed the cab-in gang-way to the deck There most sea cap-tains usu-al-ly walk at that hour as coun-try gen-tle-men af-ter the same meal take a few turns in the gar-den Soon his steady ivory stride was heard as to and fro he paced his old rounds up-on planks so fa-mil-iar to his tread that they were all over dent-ed like ge-o-log-i-cal stones with the pe-cu-liar mark of his walk Did you fixed-ly gaze too up-on that ribbed and dent-ed brow there al-so you would see still stranger foot prints the foot prints of his one un-sleep-ing ev-er pac-ing thought But on the oc-ca-sion in ques-tion those den-ts looked deep-er even as his ner-vous step that morn-ing left a deep-er mark And so full of his thought was Ahab that at ev-ery uni-form turn that he made now at the main mast and now at the bin-na-cle you could al-most see that thought turn in him as he turned and pace in him as he paced so com-plete-ly pos-sess-ing him in-deed that it all but seemed the in-ward mould of ev-ery out-er move-ment  D ye mark him Flask  whis-pered Stubb  the chick that s in him pecks the shell  Twill soon be out  The hours wore on  Ahab now shut up with-in his cab-in anon pac-ing the deck with the same in-tense big-otry of pur-pose in his as-pect It drew near the close of day Sud-den-ly he came to a halt by the bul-warks and in-sert-ing his bone leg in-to the auger hole there and with one hand grasp-ing a shroud he or-dered Star-buck to send ev-ery-body aft  Sir  said the mate as-ton-ished at an or-der sel-dom or nev-er given on ship board ex-cept in some ex-traor-di-nary case  Send ev-ery-body aft  re-peat-ed Ahab  Mast heads there come down  When the en-tire ship s com-pa-ny were as-sem-bled and with cu-ri-ous and not whol-ly un-ap-pre-hen-sive faces were eye-ing him for he looked not un-like the weath-er hori-zon when a storm is com-ing up Ahab af-ter rapid-ly glanc-ing over the bul-warks and then dart-ing his eyes among the crew start-ed from his stand-point and as though not a soul were nigh him re-sumed his heavy turns up-on the deck With bent head and half slouched hat he con-tin-ued to pace un-mind-ful of the won-der-ing whis-per-ing among the men till Stubb cau-tious-ly whis-pered to Flask that Ahab must have sum-moned them there for the pur-pose of wit-ness-ing a pedes-tri-an feat But this did not last long Ve-he-ment-ly paus-ing he cried   What do ye do when ye see a whale men   Sing out for him  was the im-pul-sive re-join-der from a score of clubbed voic-es  Good  cried Ahab with a wild ap-proval in his tones ob-serv-ing the hearty an-i-ma-tion in-to which his un-ex-pect-ed ques-tion had so mag-net-i-cal-ly thrown them  And what do ye next men   Low-er away and af-ter him   And what tune is it ye pull to men   A dead whale or a stove boat  More and more strange-ly and fierce-ly glad and ap-prov-ing grew the coun-te-nance of the old man at ev-ery shout while the mariners be-gan to gaze cu-ri-ous-ly at each oth-er as if mar-vel-ling how it was that they them-selves be-came so ex-cit-ed at such seem-ing-ly pur-pose-less ques-tions But they were all ea-ger-ness again as Ahab now half re-volv-ing in his piv-ot hole with one hand reach-ing high up a shroud and tight-ly al-most con-vul-sive-ly grasp-ing it ad-dressed them thus   All ye mast head-ers have be-fore now heard me give or-ders about a white whale Look ye d ye see this Span-ish ounce of gold   hold-ing up a broad bright coin to the sun  it is a six-teen dol-lar piece men D ye see it Mr Star-buck hand me yon top maul  While the mate was get-ting the ham-mer Ahab with-out speak-ing was slow-ly rub-bing the gold piece again-st the skirts of his jack-et as if to height-en its lus-tre and with-out us-ing any words was mean-while low-ly hum-ming to him-self pro-duc-ing a sound so strange-ly muf-fled and inar-tic-u-late that it seemed the me-chan-i-cal hum-ming of the wheels of his vi-tal-i-ty in him Re-ceiv-ing the top maul from Star-buck he ad-vanced to-wards the main mast with the ham-mer up-lift-ed in one hand ex-hibit-ing the gold with the oth-er and with a high raised voice ex-claim-ing  Whoso-ev-er of ye rais-es me a white head-ed whale with a wrin-kled brow and a crooked jaw whoso-ev-er of ye rais-es me that white head-ed whale with three holes punc-tured in his star-board fluke look ye whoso-ev-er of ye rais-es me that same white whale he shall have this gold ounce my boys   Huz-za huz-za  cried the sea-men as with swing-ing tarpaulins they hailed the act of nail-ing the gold to the mast  It s a white whale I say  re-sumed Ahab as he threw down the top-maul  a white whale Sk-in your eyes for him men look sharp for white wa-ter if ye see but a bub-ble sing out  All this while Tashte-go Dag-goo and Quee-queg had looked on with even more in-tense in-ter-est and sur-prise than the rest and at the men-tion of the wrin-kled brow and crooked jaw they had start-ed as if each was sep-a-rate-ly touched by some speci-fic rec-ol-lec-tion  Cap-tain Ahab  said Tashte-go  that white whale must be the same that some call Moby Dick   Moby Dick  shout-ed Ahab  Do ye know the white whale then Tash   Does he fan tail a lit-tle cu-ri-ous sir be-fore he goes down  said the Gay Head-er de-lib-er-ate-ly  And has he a cu-ri-ous spout too  said Dag-goo  very bushy even for a par-ma-cetty and mighty quick Cap-tain Ahab   And he have one two three oh good many iron in him hide too Cap-tain  cried Quee-queg dis-joint-ed-ly  all twiske tee be twisk like him him  fal-ter-ing hard for a word and screw-ing his hand round and round as though un-cork-ing a bot-tle  like him him   Corkscrew  cried Ahab  aye Quee-queg the har-poons lie all twist-ed and wrenched in him aye Dag-goo his spout is a big one like a whole shock of wheat and white as a pile of our Nan-tuck-et wool af-ter the great an-nu-al sheep shear-ing aye Tashte-go and he fan tails like a split jib in a squall Death and dev-ils men it is Moby Dick ye have seen Moby Dick Moby Dick   Cap-tain Ahab  said Star-buck who with Stubb and Flask had thus far been eye-ing his su-pe-ri-or with in-creas-ing sur-prise but at last seemed struck with a thought which some-what ex-plained all the won-der  Cap-tain Ahab I have heard of Moby Dick but it was not Moby Dick that took off thy leg   Who told thee that  cried Ahab then paus-ing  Aye Star-buck aye my hearties all round it was Moby Dick that dis-mast-ed me Moby Dick that brought me to this dead stump I stand on now Aye aye  he shout-ed with a ter-ri-fic loud an-i-mal sob like that of a heart strick-en moose  Aye aye it was that ac-cursed white whale that razed me made a poor peg-ging lub-ber of me for ev-er and a day  Then toss-ing both ar-ms with mea-sure-less im-pre-ca-tions he shout-ed out  Aye aye and I ll chase him round Good Hope and round the Horn and round the Nor-way Mael-strom and round perdi-tion s flames be-fore I give him up And this is what ye have shipped for men to chase that white whale on both sides of land and over all sides of earth till he spouts black blood and rol-ls fin out What say ye men will ye splice hands on it now I think ye do look brave   Aye aye  shout-ed the har-pooneers and sea-men run-ning closer to the ex-cit-ed old man  A sharp eye for the white whale a sharp lance for Moby Dick   God bless ye  he seemed to half sob and half shout  God bless ye men Ste-ward go draw the great mea-sure of grog But what s this long face about Mr Star-buck wilt thou not chase the white whale art not game for Moby Dick   I am game for his crooked jaw and for the jaws of Death too Cap-tain Ahab if it fair-ly comes in the way of the busi-ness we fol-low but I came here to hunt whales not my com-man-der s vengeance How many bar-rels will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it Cap-tain Ahab it will not fetch thee much in our Nan-tuck-et mar-ket   Nan-tuck-et mar-ket Hoot But come closer Star-buck thou re-quirest a lit-tle low-er lay-er If mon-ey s to be the mea-surer man and the ac-coun-tan-ts have com-put-ed their great count-ing house the globe by girdling it with guineas one to ev-ery three parts of an inch then let me tell thee that my vengeance will fetch a great pre-mi-um here   He smites his chest  whis-pered Stubb  what s that for me-thinks it rings most vast but hol-low   Vengeance on a dumb brute  cried Star-buck  that sim-ply smote thee from blin-dest in-stinct Mad-ness To be en-raged with a dumb thing Cap-tain Ahab seems blas-phe-mous   Hark ye yet again the lit-tle low-er lay-er All vis-i-ble ob-jec-ts man are but as paste-board masks But in each even-t in the liv-ing act the un-doubt-ed deed there some un-known but still rea-son-ing thing puts forth the mould-ings of its fea-tures from be-hind the un-rea-son-ing mask If man will strike strike through the mask How can the pris-on-er reach out-side ex-cept by thrust-ing through the wall To me the white whale is that wall shoved near to me Some-times I think there s naught be-yond But  tis enough He tasks me he heaps me I see in him out-ra-geous strength with an in-scrutable mal-ice sinew-ing it That in-scrutable thing is chiefly what I hate and be the white whale agent or be the white whale prin-ci-pal I will wreak that hate up-on him Talk not to me of blas-phe-my man I d strike the sun if it in-sult-ed me For could the sun do that then could I do the oth-er since there is ev-er a sort of fair play here-in jeal-ousy pre-sid-ing over all cre-ations But not my mas-ter man is even that fair play Who s over me Truth hath no con-fines Take off thine eye more in-tol-er-a-ble than fiend-s glar-ings is a doltish stare So so thou red-den-est and palest my heat has melt-ed thee to anger glow But look ye Star-buck what is said in heat that thing un-says it-self There are men from whom warm words are small in-dig-ni-ty I meant not to in-cense thee Let it go Look see yon-der Turk-ish cheeks of spot-ted tawn liv-ing breath-ing pic-tures paint-ed by the sun The Pa-gan leop-ard-s the un-reck-ing and un-wor-ship-ping things that live and seek and give no rea-sons for the tor-rid life they feel The crew man the crew Are they not one and all with Ahab in this mat-ter of the whale See Stubb he laughs See yon-der Chil-ian he snorts to think of it Stand up amid the gen-er-al hur-ri-cane thy one tost sapling can-not Star-buck And what is it Reck-on it  Tis but to help strike a fin no won-drous feat for Star-buck What is it more From this one poor hunt then the best lance out of all Nan-tuck-et sure-ly he will not hang back when ev-ery fore-mast hand has clutched a whet-stone Ah con-strain-ings seize thee I see the bil-low lifts thee Speak but speak  Aye aye thy si-lence then that voic-es thee Aside Some-thing shot from my di-lat-ed nos-trils he has in-haled it in his lungs Star-buck now is mine can-not op-pose me now with-out re-bel-lion   God keep me  keep us all  mur-mured Star-buck low-ly But in his joy at the en-chant-ed tac-it ac-qui-es-cence of the mate Ahab did not hear his fore-bod-ing in-vo-ca-tion nor yet the low laugh from the hold nor yet the pre-sag-ing vi-bra-tions of the winds in the cordage nor yet the hol-low flap of the sails again-st the mas-ts as for a mo-ment their hearts sank in For again Star-buck s down-cast eyes light-ed up with the stub-born-ness of life the sub-ter-ranean laugh died away the winds blew on the sails filled out the ship heaved and rolled as be-fore Ah ye ad-mo-ni-tions and warn-ings why stay ye not when ye come But rather are ye pre-dic-tions than warn-ings ye shad-ows Yet not so much pre-dic-tions from with-out as ver-i-fi-ca-tions of the fore-go-ing things with-in For with lit-tle ex-ter-nal to con-strain us the in-ner-most ne-ces-si-ties in our be-ing the-se still drive us on  The mea-sure the mea-sure  cried Ahab Re-ceiv-ing the brim-ming pewter and turn-ing to the har-pooneers he or-dered them to pro-duce their weapons Then rang-ing them be-fore him near the cap-stan with their har-poons in their hands while his three mates stood at his side with their lances and the rest of the ship s com-pa-ny formed a cir-cle round the group he stood for an in-stant search-ing-ly eye-ing ev-ery man of his crew But those wild eyes met his as the blood-shot eyes of the prair-ie wolves meet the eye of their lead-er ere he rush-es on at their head in the trail of the bison but alas on-ly to fall in-to the hid-den snare of the In-di-an  Drink and pass  he cried hand-ing the heavy charged flagon to the near-est sea-man  The crew alone now drink Round with it round Short draught-s long swal-lows men  tis hot as Satan s hoof So so it goes round ex-cel-lent-ly It spi-ral-izes in ye forks out at the ser-pent snap-ping eye Well done al-most drained That way it went this way it comes Hand it me here s a hol-low Men ye seem the years so brim-ming life is gulped and gone Ste-ward re-fill  At-tend now my braves I have mus-tered ye all round this cap-stan and ye mates flank me with your lances and ye har-pooneers stand there with your irons and ye stout mariners ring me in that I may in some sort re-vive a no-ble cus-tom of my fish-er-man fa-thers be-fore me O men you will yet see that Ha boy come back bad pen-nies come not soon-er Hand it me Why now this pewter had run brim-ming again wer t not thou St Vi-tus im-p away thou ague  Ad-vance ye mates Cross your lances full be-fore me Well done Let me touch the ax-is  So say-ing with ex-tend-ed arm he grasped the three lev-el ra-di-at-ing lances at their crossed cen-tre while so do-ing sud-den-ly and ner-vous-ly twitched them mean-while glanc-ing in-tent-ly from Star-buck to Stubb from Stubb to Flask It seemed as though by some name-less in-te-ri-or vo-li-tion he would fain have shocked in-to them the same fiery emo-tion ac-cu-mu-lat-ed with-in the Ley-den jar of his own mag-net-ic life The three mates quailed be-fore his strong sus-tained and mys-tic as-pect Stubb and Flask looked side-ways from him the hon-est eye of Star-buck fell down-right  In vain  cried Ahab  but may-be  tis well For did ye three but on-ce take the full forced shock then mine own elec-tric thing that had per-haps ex-pired from out me Per-chance too it would have dropped ye dead Per-chance ye need it not Down lances And now ye mates I do ap-point ye three cup-bear-ers to my three pa-gan kins-men there yon three most hon-or-able gen-tle-men and no-ble-men my valiant har-pooneers Dis-dain the task What when the great Pope wash-es the feet of beg-gars us-ing his tiara for ew-er Oh my sweet car-di-nals your own con-de-scen-sion that shall bend ye to it I do not or-der ye ye will it Cut your seiz-ings and draw the poles ye har-pooneers  Si-lent-ly obey-ing the or-der the three har-pooneers now stood with the de-tached iron part of their har-poons some three feet long held bar-bs up be-fore him  Stab me not with that keen steel Cant them cant them over know ye not the gob-let end Turn up the sock-et So so now ye cup bear-ers ad-vance The irons take them hold them while I fill  Forth-with slow-ly go-ing from one of-fi-cer to the oth-er he brimmed the har-poon sock-ets with the fiery wa-ters from the pewter  Now three to three ye stand Com-mend the mur-der-ous chal-ices Bestow them ye who are now made par-ties to this in-dis-sol-uble league Ha Star-buck but the deed is done Yon rat-i-fy-ing sun now waits to sit up-on it Drink ye har-pooneers drink and swear ye men that man the death-ful whale-boat s bow Death to Moby Dick God hunt us all if we do not hunt Moby Dick to his death  The long barbed steel gob-lets were lift-ed and to cries and male-dic-tions again-st the white whale the spir-its were si-mul-ta-ne-ous-ly quaffed down with a hiss Star-buck paled and turned and shiv-ered Once more and fi-nal-ly the re-plen-ished pewter went the rounds among the fran-tic crew when wav-ing his free hand to them they all dis-persed and Ahab re-tired with-in his cab-in CHAPTER 37 Sun-set The cab-in by the stern win-dows Ahab sit-ting alone and gaz-ing out I leave a white and tur-bid wake pale wa-ters paler cheeks where er I sail The en-vi-ous bil-lows side-long swell to whelm my track let them but first I pass Yon-der by ev-er brim-ming gob-let s rim the warm waves blush like wine The gold brow plumbs the blue The di-ver sun slow dived from noon goes down my soul moun-ts up she wea-ries with her end-less hill Is then the crown too heavy that I wear this Iron Crown of Lom-bardy Yet is it bright with many a gem I the wearer see not its far flash-ings but dark-ly feel that I wear that that daz-zling-ly con-founds  Tis iron that I know not gold  Tis split too that I feel the jagged edge gal-ls me so my brain seems to beat again-st the solid met-al aye steel skull mine the sort that needs no hel-met in the most brain bat-ter-ing fight Dry heat up-on my brow Oh time was when as the sun-rise nobly spurred me so the sun-set soothed No more This love-ly light it lights not me all love-li-ness is an-guish to me since I can ne er en-joy Gift-ed with the high per-cep-tion I lack the low en-joy-ing pow-er damned most sub-tly and most ma-lig-nant-ly damned in the mid-st of Par-adise Good night good night wav-ing his hand he moves from the win-dow  Twas not so hard a task I thought to find one stub-born at the least but my one cogged cir-cle fits in-to all their

Moby Dick I Ish-mael was one of that crew my shouts had gone up with the rest my oath had been weld-ed with theirs and stronger I shout-ed and more did I ham-mer and clinch my oath be-cause of the dread in my soul A wild mys-ti-cal sym-pa-thet-i-cal feel-ing was in me Ahab s quench-less feud seemed mine With greedy ears I learned the his-to-ry of that mur-der-ous mon-ster again-st whom I and all the oth-ers had tak-en our oaths of vi-o-lence and re-venge For some time past though at in-ter-vals on-ly the un-ac-com-pa-nied se-clud-ed White Whale had haunt-ed those un-civ-i-lized seas most-ly fre-quent-ed by the Sperm Whale fish-er-men But not all of them knew of his ex-is-tence on-ly a few of them com-par-a-tive-ly had know-ing-ly seen him while the num-ber who as yet had ac-tu-al-ly and know-ing-ly given bat-tle to him was small in-deed For ow-ing to the large num-ber of whale cruis-ers the dis-or-der-ly way they were sprin-kled over the en-tire wa-tery cir-cum-fer-ence many of them ad-ven-tur-ous-ly push-ing their quest along soli-tary lat-i-tudes so as sel-dom or nev-er for a whole twelve-mon-th or more on a stretch to en-coun-ter a sin-gle news telling sail of any sort the in-or-di-nate length of each sep-a-rate voy-age the ir-reg-u-lar-i-ty of the times of sail-ing from home all the-se with oth-er cir-cum-stances di-rect and in-di-rect long ob-struct-ed the spread through the whole world wide whal-ing fleet of the spe-cial in-di-vid-u-al-iz-ing tid-ings con-cern-ing Moby Dick It was hard-ly to be doubt-ed that sev-er-al ves-sels re-port-ed to have en-coun-tered at such or such a time or on such or such a merid-i-an a Sperm Whale of un-com-mon mag-ni-tude and ma-lig-ni-ty which whale af-ter do-ing great mis-chief to his as-sailan-ts had com-plete-ly es-caped them to some minds it was not an un-fair pre-sump-tion I say that the whale in ques-tion must have been no oth-er than Moby Dick Yet as of late the Sperm Whale fish-ery had been marked by var-i-ous and not un-fre-quent in-stances of great fe-roc-i-ty cun-ning and mal-ice in the mon-ster at-tacked there-fore it was that those who by ac-ci-dent ig-no-rant-ly gave bat-tle to Moby Dick such hunters per-haps for the most part were con-tent to as-cribe the pe-cu-liar ter-ror he bred more as it were to the per-ils of the Sperm Whale fish-ery at large than to the in-di-vid-u-al cause In that way most-ly the dis-as-trous en-coun-ter be-tween Ahab and the whale had hith-er-to been pop-u-lar-ly re-gard-ed And as for those who pre-vi-ous-ly hear-ing of the White Whale by chance caught sight of him in the be-gin-ning of the thing they had ev-ery one of them al-most as bold-ly and fear-less-ly low-ered for him as for any oth-er whale of that species But at length such calami-ties did en-sue in the-se as-sault-s not re-strict-ed to sprained wrists and an-kles bro-ken lim-bs or de-vour-ing am-pu-ta-tion-s but fa-tal to the last de-gree of fa-tal-i-ty those re-peat-ed dis-as-trous re-puls-es all ac-cu-mu-lat-ing and pil-ing their ter-rors up-on Moby Dick those things had gone far to shake the for-ti-tude of many brave hunters to whom the sto-ry of the White Whale had even-tu-al-ly come Nor did wild ru-mors of all sorts fail to ex-ag-ger-ate and still the more hor-ri-fy the true his-to-ries of the-se dead-ly en-coun-ters For not on-ly do fab-u-lous ru-mors nat-u-ral-ly grow out of the very body of all sur-pris-ing ter-ri-ble even-ts  as the smit-ten tree gives birth to its fungi but in mar-itime life far more than in that of ter-ra fir-ma wild ru-mors abound wherever there is any ad-e-quate re-al-i-ty for them to cling to And as the sea sur-pass-es the land in this mat-ter so the whale fish-ery sur-pass-es ev-ery oth-er sort of mar-itime life in the won-der-ful-ness and fear-ful-ness of the ru-mors which some-times cir-cu-late there For not on-ly are whale-men as a body un-ex-empt from that ig-no-rance and su-per-sti-tious-ness hered-i-tary to all sailors but of all sailors they are by all odds the most di-rect-ly brought in-to con-tact with what-ev-er is ap-palling-ly as-ton-ish-ing in the sea face to face they not on-ly eye its great-est mar-vels but hand to jaw give bat-tle to them Alone in such re-motest wa-ters that though you sailed a thou-sand miles and passed a thou-sand shores you would not come to any chis-eled hearth stone or aught hos-pitable be-neath that part of the sun in such lat-i-tudes and lon-gi-tudes pur-su-ing too such a call-ing as he does the whale-man is wrapped by in-flu-ences all tend-ing to make his fan-cy preg-nant with many a mighty birth No won-der then that ev-er gath-er-ing vol-ume from the mere tran-sit over the widest wa-tery spaces the out-blown ru-mors of the White Whale did in the end in-cor-po-rate with them-selves all man-ner of mor-bid hin-ts and half formed f tal sug-ges-tions of su-per-nat-u-ral agen-cies which even-tu-al-ly in-vest-ed Moby Dick with new ter-rors un-bor-rowed from any-thing that vis-i-bly ap-pears So that in many cas-es such a pan-ic did he fi-nal-ly strike that few who by those ru-mors at least had heard of the White Whale few of those hunters were will-ing to en-coun-ter the per-ils of his jaw But there were still oth-er and more vi-tal prac-ti-cal in-flu-ences at work Not even at the pre-sent day has the orig-i-nal pres-tige of the Sperm Whale as fear-ful-ly dis-tin-guished from all oth-er species of the leviathan died out of the minds of the whale-men as a body There are those this day among them who though in-tel-li-gent and coura-geous enough in of-fer-ing bat-tle to the Green-land or Right whale would per-hap-s ei-ther from pro-fes-sion-al in-ex-pe-ri-ence or in-com-pe-ten-cy or timid-i-ty de-cline a con-test with the Sperm Whale at any rate there are plen-ty of whale-men es-pe-cial-ly among those whal-ing na-tions not sail-ing un-der the Amer-i-can flag who have nev-er hos-tile-ly en-coun-tered the Sperm Whale but whose sole knowl-edge of the leviathan is re-strict-ed to the ig-no-ble mon-ster prim-i-tive-ly pur-sued in the North seat-ed on their hatch-es the-se men will hear-ken with a child-ish fireside in-ter-est and awe to the wild strange tales of South-ern whal-ing Nor is the pre em-i-nent tremen-dous-ness of the great Sperm Whale any-where more feel-ing-ly com-pre-hend-ed than on board of those prows which stem him And as if the now test-ed re-al-i-ty of his might had in for-mer leg-endary times thrown its shad-ow be-fore it we find some book nat-u-ral-ist-s Olassen and Povel-son declar-ing the Sperm Whale not on-ly to be a con-ster-na-tion to ev-ery oth-er crea-ture in the sea but al-so to be so in-cred-i-bly fe-ro-cious as con-tin-u-al-ly to be athirst for hu-man blood Nor even down to so late a time as Cu-vier s were the-se or al-most sim-i-lar im-pres-sions ef-faced For in his Nat-u-ral His-to-ry the Baron him-self af-fir-ms that at sight of the Sperm Whale all fish sharks in-clud-ed are  struck with the most live-ly ter-rors  and  of-ten in the pre-cip-i-tan-cy of their flight dash them-selves again-st the rocks with such vi-o-lence as to cause in-stan-ta-neous death  And how-ev-er the gen-er-al ex-pe-ri-ences in the fish-ery may amend such re-ports as the-se yet in their full ter-ri-ble-ness even to the blood-thirsty item of Povel-son the su-per-sti-tious be-lief in them is in some vi-cis-si-tudes of their vo-ca-tion re-vived in the minds of the hunters So that over-awed by the ru-mors and por-ten-ts con-cern-ing him not a few of the fish-er-men re-called in ref-er-ence to Moby Dick the ear-lier days of the Sperm Whale fish-ery when it was of-ten-times hard to in-duce long prac-tised Right whale-men to em-bark in the per-ils of this new and dar-ing war-fare such men protest-ing that al-though oth-er leviathans might be hope-ful-ly pur-sued yet to chase and point lance at such an ap-pari-tion as the Sperm Whale was not for mor-tal man That to at-tempt it would be in-evitably to be torn in-to a quick eter-ni-ty On this head there are some re-mark-able doc-u-men-ts that may be con-sult-ed Nev-er-the-less some there were who even in the face of the-se things were ready to give chase to Moby Dick and a still greater num-ber who chanc-ing on-ly to hear of him dis-tant-ly and vague-ly with-out the speci-fic de-tails of any cer-tain calami-ty and with-out su-per-sti-tious ac-com-pa-ni-men-ts were suf-fi-cient-ly hardy not to flee from the bat-tle if of-fered One of the wild sug-ges-tions re-ferred to as at last com-ing to be linked with the White Whale in the minds of the su-per-sti-tious-ly in-clined was the un-earth-ly con-ceit that Moby Dick was ubiq-ui-tous that he had ac-tu-al-ly been en-coun-tered in op-po-site lat-i-tudes at one and the same in-stant of time Nor cred-u-lous as such minds must have been was this con-ceit al-to-geth-er with-out some faint show of su-per-sti-tious prob-a-bil-i-ty For as the se-crets of the cur-ren-ts in the seas have nev-er yet been di-vulged even to the most eru-dite re-search so the hid-den ways of the Sperm Whale when be-neath the sur-face re-main in great part un-ac-count-able to his pur-suers and from time to time have orig-i-nat-ed the most cu-ri-ous and con-tra-dic-to-ry spec-u-la-tions re-gard-ing them es-pe-cial-ly con-cern-ing the mys-tic mod-es where-by af-ter sound-ing to a great depth he trans-ports him-self with such vast swift-ness to the most wide-ly dis-tant points It is a thing well known to both Amer-i-can and English whale ships and as well a thing placed up-on au-thor-i-ta-tive record years ago by Scores-by that some whales have been cap-tured far north in the Paci-fic in whose bod-ies have been found the bar-bs of har-poons dart-ed in the Green-land seas Nor is it to be gain-said that in some of the-se in-stances it has been de-clared that the in-ter-val of time be-tween the two as-saults could not have ex-ceed-ed very many days Hence by in-fer-ence it has been be-lieved by some whale-men that the Nor West Pas-sage so long a prob-lem to man was nev-er a prob-lem to the whale So that here in the re-al liv-ing ex-pe-ri-ence of liv-ing men the prodigies re-lat-ed in old times of the in-land Strel-lo moun-tain in Por-tu-gal near whose top there was said to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships float-ed up to the sur-face and that still more won-der-ful sto-ry of the Arethusa foun-tain near Syra-cuse whose wa-ters were be-lieved to have come from the Holy Land by an un-der-ground pas-sage the-se fab-u-lous nar-ra-tions are al-most ful-ly equalled by the re-al-i-ties of the whale-men Forced in-to fa-mil-iar-i-ty then with such prodigies as the-se and know-ing that af-ter re-peat-ed in-trepid as-saults the White Whale had es-caped alive it can-not be much mat-ter of sur-prise that some whale-men should go still fur-ther in their su-per-sti-tions declar-ing Moby Dick not on-ly ubiq-ui-tous but im-mor-tal for im-mor-tal-i-ty is but ubiq-ui-ty in time that though groves of spears should be plant-ed in his flanks he would still swim away un-harmed or if in-deed he should ev-er be made to spout thick blood such a sight would be but a ghast-ly de-cep-tion for again in un-en-san-guined bil-lows hun-dreds of leagues away his un-sul-lied jet would on-ce more be seen But even stripped of the-se su-per-nat-u-ral sur-mis-ings there was enough in the earth-ly make and in-con-testable char-ac-ter of the mon-ster to strike the imag-i-na-tion with un-wont-ed pow-er For it was not so much his un-com-mon bulk that so much dis-tin-guished him from oth-er sperm whales but as was else-where thrown out a pe-cu-liar snow white wrin-kled fore-head and a high pyra-midi-cal white hump Th-e-se were his promi-nent fea-tures the to-kens where-by even in the lim-it-less un-chart-ed seas he re-vealed his iden-ti-ty at a long dis-tance to those who knew him The rest of his body was so streaked and spot-ted and mar-bled with the same shroud-ed hue that in the end he had gained his dis-tinc-tive ap-pel-la-tion of the White Whale a name in-deed lit-er-al-ly jus-ti-fied by his vivid as-pect when seen glid-ing at high noon through a dark blue sea leav-ing a milky way wake of creamy foam all span-gled with gold-en gleam-ings Nor was it his un-wont-ed mag-ni-tude nor his re-mark-able hue nor yet his de-formed low-er jaw that so much in-vest-ed the whale with nat-u-ral ter-ror as that un-ex-am-pled in-tel-li-gent ma-lig-ni-ty which ac-cord-ing to speci-fic ac-coun-ts he had over and over again evinced in his as-saults More than all his treach-er-ous re-treats struck more of dis-may than per-haps aught else For when swim-ming be-fore his ex-ult-ing pur-suers with ev-ery ap-par-ent symp-tom of alarm he had sev-er-al times been known to turn round sud-den-ly and bear-ing down up-on them ei-ther stave their boats to splin-ters or drive them back in con-ster-na-tion to their ship Al-ready sev-er-al fa-tal-i-ties had at-tend-ed his chase But though sim-i-lar dis-as-ters how-ev-er lit-tle bruit-ed ashore were by no means un-usu-al in the fish-ery yet in most in-stances such seemed the White Whale s in-fer-nal afore-thought of fe-roc-i-ty that ev-ery dis-mem-ber-ing or death that he caused was not whol-ly re-gard-ed as hav-ing been in-flict-ed by an un-in-tel-li-gent agent Judge then to what pitch-es of in-flamed dis-tract-ed fury the minds of his more des-per-ate hunters were im-pelled when amid the chips of chewed boats and the sink-ing lim-bs of torn com-rades they swam out of the white cur-ds of the whale s dire-ful wrath in-to the serene ex-as-per-at-ing sun-light that smiled on as if at a birth or a bridal His three boats stove around him and oars and men both whirling in the ed-dies one cap-tain seiz-ing the line knife from his bro-ken prow had dashed at the whale as an Arkansas du-el-list at his foe blind-ly seek-ing with a six inch blade to reach the fath-om deep life of the whale That cap-tain was Ahab And then it was that sud-den-ly sweep-ing his sick-le shaped low-er jaw be-neath him Moby Dick had reaped away Ahab s leg as a mow-er a blade of grass in the field No tur-baned Turk no hired Vene-tian or Malay could have smote him with more seem-ing mal-ice Small rea-son was there to doubt then that ev-er since that al-most fa-tal en-coun-ter Ahab had cher-ished a wild vin-dic-tive-ness again-st the whale all the more fell for that in his fran-tic mor-bid-ness he at last came to iden-ti-fy with him not on-ly all his bod-i-ly woes but all his in-tel-lec-tu-al and spir-i-tu-al ex-as-per-a-tions The White Whale swam be-fore him as the mono-ma-ni-ac in-car-na-tion of all those ma-li-cious agen-cies which some deep men feel eat-ing in them till they are left liv-ing on with half a heart and half a lung That in-tan-gi-ble ma-lig-ni-ty which has been from the be-gin-ning to whose do-min-ion even the mod-ern Chris-tians as-cribe one half of the worlds which the an-cient Ophites of the east rev-er-enced in their stat-ue dev-il  Ahab did not fall down and wor-ship it like them but deliri-ous-ly trans-fer-ring its idea to the ab-horred white whale he pit-ted him-self all mu-ti-lat-ed again-st it All that most mad-dens and tor-men-ts all that stirs up the lees of things all truth with mal-ice in it all that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain all the sub-tle de-monis-ms of life and thought all evil to crazy Ahab were vis-i-bly per-son-i-fied and made prac-ti-cal-ly as-sail-able in Moby Dick He piled up-on the whale s white hump the sum of all the gen-er-al rage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down and then as if his chest had been a mor-tar he burst his hot heart s shell up-on it It is not prob-a-ble that this mono-ma-nia in him took its in-stant rise at the pre-cise time of his bod-i-ly dis-mem-ber-ment Then in dart-ing at the mon-ster knife in hand he had but given loose to a sud-den pas-sion-ate cor-po-ral an-i-mos-i-ty and when he re-ceived the stroke that tore him he prob-a-bly but felt the ag-o-niz-ing bod-i-ly lac-er-a-tion but noth-ing more Yet when by this col-li-sion forced to turn to-wards home and for long months of days and weeks Ahab and an-guish lay stretched to-geth-er in one ham-mock round-ing in mid win-ter that drea-ry howl-ing Patag-o-ni-an Cape then it was that his torn body and gashed soul bled in-to one an-oth-er and so in-ter-fus-ing made him mad That it was on-ly then on the home-ward voy-age af-ter the en-coun-ter that the fi-nal mono-ma-nia seized him seems all but cer-tain from the fact that at in-ter-vals dur-ing the pas-sage he was a rav-ing lu-natic and though un-limbed of a leg yet such vi-tal strength yet lurked in his Egyp-tian chest and was more-over in-ten-si-fied by his delir-i-um that his mates were forced to lace him fast even there as he sailed rav-ing in his ham-mock In a strait jack-et he swung to the mad rock-ings of the gales And when run-ning in-to more suf-fer-able lat-i-tudes the ship with mild stun sails spread float-ed across the tran-quil trop-ics and to all ap-pear-ances the old man s delir-i-um seemed left be-hind him with the Cape Horn swells and he came forth from his dark den in-to the blessed light and air even then when he bore that firm col-lect-ed front how-ev-er pale and is-sued his calm or-ders on-ce again and his mates thanked God the dire-ful mad-ness was now gone even then Ahab in his hid-den self raved on Hu-man mad-ness is of-ten-times a cun-ning and most fe-line thing When you think it fled it may have but be-come trans-fig-ured in-to some still sub-tler form Ahab s full lu-na-cy sub-sid-ed not but deep-en-ing-ly con-tract-ed like the un-abat-ed Hud-son when that no-ble North-man flows nar-row-ly but un-fath-omably through the High-land gorge But as in his nar-row flow-ing mono-ma-nia not one jot of Ahab s broad mad-ness had been left be-hind so in that broad mad-ness not one jot of his great nat-u-ral in-tel-lect had per-ished That be-fore liv-ing agent now be-came the liv-ing in-stru-ment If such a fu-ri-ous trope may stand his spe-cial lu-na-cy stormed his gen-er-al san-i-ty and car-ried it and turned all its con-cen-tred can-non up-on its own mad mark so that far from hav-ing lost his strength Ahab to that one end did now pos-sess a thou-sand fold more po-ten-cy than ev-er he had sane-ly brought to bear up-on any one rea-son-able ob-ject This is much yet Ahab s larg-er dark-er deep-er part re-mains un-hint-ed But vain to pop-u-lar-ize pro-fun-di-ties and all truth is pro-found Wind-ing far down from with-in the very heart of this spiked Hotel de Cluny where we here stand how-ev-er grand and won-der-ful now quit it  and take your way ye no-bler sad-der souls to those vast Ro-man hal-ls of Ther-mes where far be-neath the fan-tas-tic tow-ers of man s up-per earth his root of grandeur his whole aw-ful essence sits in beard-ed state an an-tique buried be-neath an-tiq-ui-ties and throned on tor-soes So with a bro-ken throne the great gods mock that cap-tive king so like a Cary-atid he pa-tient sits up-hold-ing on his frozen brow the piled entab-la-tures of ages Wind ye down there ye proud-er sad-der souls ques-tion that proud sad king A fam-i-ly like-ness aye he did beget ye ye young ex-iled roy-alties and from your grim sire on-ly will the old State se-cret come Now in his heart Ahab had some glimpse of this name-ly all my means are sane my mo-tive and my ob-ject mad Yet with-out pow-er to kill or change or shun the fact he like-wise knew that to mankind he did long dis-sem-ble in some sort did still But that thing of his dis-sem-bling was on-ly sub-ject to his per-cep-ti-bil-i-ty not to his will de-ter-mi-nate Nev-er-the-less so well did he suc-ceed in that dis-sem-bling that when with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last no Nan-tuck-eter thought him oth-er-wise than but nat-u-ral-ly grieved and that to the quick with the ter-ri-ble ca-su-al-ty which had over-tak-en him The re-port of his un-de-ni-able delir-i-um at sea was like-wise pop-u-lar-ly as-cribed to a kin-dred cause And so too all the added mood-i-ness which al-ways af-ter-wards to the very day of sail-ing in the Pe-quod on the pre-sent voy-age sat brood-ing on his brow Nor is it so very un-like-ly that far from dis-trust-ing his fit-ness for an-oth-er whal-ing voy-age on ac-count of such dark symp-toms the cal-cu-lat-ing peo-ple of that pru-dent isle were in-clined to har-bor the con-ceit that for those very rea-sons he was all the bet-ter qual-i-fied and set on edge for a pur-suit so full of rage and wild-ness as the bloody hunt of whales Gnawed with-in and scorched with-out with the in-fixed un-re-lent-ing fangs of some in-cur-able idea such an one could he be found would seem the very man to dart his iron and lift his lance again-st the most ap-palling of all brutes Or if for any rea-son thought to be cor-po-re-al-ly in-ca-pac-i-tat-ed for that yet such an one would seem su-perla-tive-ly com-pe-tent to cheer and howl on his un-der-lings to the at-tack But be all this as it may cer-tain it is that with the mad se-cret of his un-abat-ed rage bolt-ed up and keyed in him Ahab had pur-pose-ly sailed up-on the pre-sent voy-age with the one on-ly and all en-gross-ing ob-ject of hunt-ing the White Whale Had any one of his old ac-quain-tances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurk-ing in him then how soon would their aghast and righ-teous souls have wrenched the ship from such a fiendish man They were bent on prof-itable cruis-es the prof-it to be count-ed down in dol-lars from the mint He was in-tent on an au-da-cious im-mit-i-ga-ble and su-per-nat-u-ral re-venge Here then was this grey head-ed un-god-ly old man chas-ing with curs-es a Job s whale round the world at the head of a crew too chiefly made up of mon-grel rene-gades and cast-aways and can-ni-bal-s moral-ly en-fee-bled al-so by the in-com-pe-tence of mere un-aid-ed virtue or right mind-ed-ness in Star-buck the in-vul-ner-a-ble jol-li-ty of in-dif-fer-ence and reck-less-ness in Stubb and the per-vad-ing medi-ocrity in Flask Such a crew so of-fi-cered seemed spe-cial-ly picked and packed by some in-fer-nal fa-tal-i-ty to help him to his mono-ma-ni-ac re-venge How it was that they so abound-ing-ly re-spond-ed to the old man s ire by what evil mag-ic their souls were pos-sessed that at times his hate seemed al-most theirs the White Whale as much their in-suf-fer-able foe as his how all this came to be what the White Whale was to them or how to their un-con-scious un-der-stand-ings al-so in some dim un-sus-pect-ed way he might have seemed the glid-ing great de-mon of the seas of life  all this to ex-plain would be to di-ve deep-er than Ish-mael can go The sub-ter-ranean min-er that works in us all how can one tell whith-er leads his shaft by the ev-er shift-ing muf-fled sound of his pick Who does not feel the ir-re-sistible arm drag What skiff in tow of a sev-en-ty four can stand still For one I gave my-self up to the aban-don-ment of the time and the place but while yet all a rush to en-coun-ter the whale could see naught in that brute but the dead-li-est ill CHAPTER 42 The White-ness of the Whale What the white whale was to Ahab has been hint-ed what at times he was to me as yet re-mains un-said Aside from those more ob-vi-ous con-sid-er-a-tions touch-ing Moby Dick which could not but oc-ca-sion-al-ly awak-en in any man s soul some alarm there was an-oth-er thought or rather vague name-less hor-ror con-cern-ing him which at times by its in-ten-si-ty com-plete-ly over-pow-ered all the rest and yet so mys-ti-cal and well nigh in-ef-fa-ble was it that I al-most de-spair of putting it in a com-pre-hen-si-ble form It was the white-ness of the whale that above all things ap-palled me But how can I hope to ex-plain my-self here and yet in some dim ran-dom way ex-plain my-self I must else all the-se chap-ters might be naught Though in many nat-u-ral ob-jec-ts white-ness re-fin-ing-ly en-hances beau-ty as if im-part-ing some spe-cial virtue of its own as in mar-bles japon-i-cas and pearls and though var-i-ous na-tions have in some way recog-nised a cer-tain roy-al pre-em-i-nence in this hue even the bar-bar-ic grand old kings of Pegu plac-ing the ti-tle  Lord of the White Ele-phants above all their oth-er mag-nil-o-quent as-crip-tions of do-min-ion and the mod-ern kings of Si-am un-furling the same snow white quadruped in the roy-al stan-dard and the Hanove-ri-an flag bear-ing the one fig-ure of a snow white charg-er and the great Aus-tri-an Em-pire C sar-i-an heir to over-lord-ing Rome hav-ing for the im-pe-ri-al colour the same im-pe-ri-al hue and though this pre em-i-nence in it ap-plies to the hu-man race it-self giv-ing the white man ide-al mas-ter-ship over ev-ery dusky tribe and though be-sides all this white-ness has been even made sig-nif-i-cant of glad-ness for among the Ro-mans a white stone marked a joy-ful day and though in oth-er mor-tal sym-pa-thies and sym-bol-iz-ings this same hue is made the em-blem of many touch-ing no-ble things the in-no-cence of brides the be-nig-ni-ty of age though among the Red Men of Amer-i-ca the giv-ing of the white belt of wampum was the deep-est pledge of hon-or though in many climes white-ness typ-i-fies the majesty of Jus-tice in the er-mine of the Judge and con-tributes to the dai-ly state of kings and queens drawn by milk white steeds though even in the high-er mys-ter-ies of the most au-gust re-li-gions it has been made the sym-bol of the di-vine spot-less-ness and pow-er by the Per-sian fire wor-ship-pers the white forked flame be-ing held the holi-est on the al-tar and in the Greek mytholo-gies Great Jove him-self be-ing made in-car-nate in a snow white bull and though to the no-ble Iro-quois the mid-win-ter sac-ri-fice of the sa-cred White Dog was by far the holi-est fes-ti-val of their the-ol-o-gy that spot-less faith-ful crea-ture be-ing held the purest en-voy they could send to the Great Spir-it with the an-nu-al tid-ings of their own fi-deli-ty and though di-rect-ly from the Lat-in word for white all Chris-tian priests de-rive the name of one part of their sa-cred ves-ture the alb or tu-nic worn be-neath the cas-sock and though among the holy pom-ps of the Romish faith white is spe-cial-ly em-ployed in the cel-e-bra-tion of the Pas-sion of our Lord though in the Vi-sion of St John white robes are given to the re-deemed and the four and twen-ty el-ders stand clothed in white be-fore the great white throne and the Holy One that sit-teth there white like wool yet for all the-se ac-cu-mu-lat-ed as-so-ci-a-tions with what-ev-er is sweet and hon-or-able and sub-lime there yet lurks an elu-sive some-thing in the in-ner-most idea of this hue which strikes more of pan-ic to the soul than that red-ness which af-frights in blood This elu-sive qual-i-ty it is which caus-es the thought of white-ness when di-vorced from more kind-ly as-so-ci-a-tions and cou-pled with any ob-ject ter-ri-ble in it-self to height-en that ter-ror to the fur-thest bounds Wit-ness the white bear of the poles and the white shark of the trop-ics what but their smooth flaky white-ness makes them the tran-scen-dent hor-rors they are That ghast-ly white-ness it is which im-parts such an ab-hor-rent mild-ness even more loath-some than ter-ri-fic to the dumb gloat-ing of their as-pect So that not the fierce fanged tiger in his heraldic coat can so stag-ger courage as the white shroud-ed bear or shark With ref-er-ence to the Po-lar bear it may pos-si-bly be urged by him who would fain go still deep-er in-to this mat-ter that it is not the white-ness sep-a-rate-ly re-gard-ed which height-ens the in-tol-er-a-ble hideous-ness of that brute for anal-ysed that height-ened hideous-ness it might be said on-ly ris-es from the cir-cum-stance that the ir-re-spon-si-ble fe-ro-cious-ness of the crea-ture stands in-vest-ed in the fleece of ce-les-tial in-no-cence and love and hence by bring-ing to-geth-er two such op-po-site emo-tions in our minds the Po-lar bear fright-ens us with so un-nat-u-ral a con-trast But even as-sum-ing all this to be true yet were it not for the white-ness you would not have that in-ten-si-fied ter-ror As for the white shark the white glid-ing ghost-li-ness of re-pose in that crea-ture when be-held in his or-di-nary moods strange-ly tal-lies with the same qual-i-ty in the Po-lar quadruped This pe-cu-liar-i-ty is most vivid-ly hit by the French in the name they be-stow up-on that fish The Romish mass for the dead be-gins with  Re-quiem eter-nam eter-nal rest whence Re-quiem de-nom-i-nat-ing the mass it-self and any oth-er fu-ner-al mu-sic Now in al-lu-sion to the white silent still-ness of death in this shark and the mild dead-li-ness of his habits the French call him Re-quin Be-think thee of the al-ba-tross whence come those clouds of spir-i-tu-al won-der-ment and pale dread in which that white phan-tom sails in all imag-i-na-tions Not Co-leridge first threw that spell but God s great un-flat-ter-ing lau-re-ate Na-ture I re-mem-ber the first al-ba-tross I ev-er saw It was dur-ing a pro-longed gale in wa-ters hard up-on the Antarc-tic seas From my forenoon watch be-low I as-cend-ed to the over-cloud-ed deck and there dashed up-on the main hatch-es I saw a re-gal feath-ery thing of unspot-ted white-ness and with a hooked Ro-man bill sub-lime At in-ter-vals it arched forth its vast archangel wings as if to em-brace some holy ark Won-drous flut-ter-ings and throb-bings shook it Though bod-i-ly un-harmed it ut-tered cries as some king s ghost in su-per-nat-u-ral dis-tress Through its in-ex-press-ible strange eyes methought I peeped to se-crets which took hold of God As Abra-ham be-fore the an-gels I bowed my-self the white thing was so white its wings so wide and in those for ev-er ex-iled wa-ters I had lost the mis-er-able warp-ing mem-o-ries of tra-di-tions and of towns Long I gazed at that prodi-gy of plumage I can-not tell can on-ly hint the things that dart-ed through me then But at last I awoke and turn-ing asked a sailor what bird was this A goney he replied Goney nev-er had heard that name be-fore is it con-ceiv-able that this glo-ri-ous thing is ut-ter-ly un-known to men ashore nev-er But some time af-ter I learned that goney was some sea-man s name for al-ba-tross So that by no pos-si-bil-i-ty could Co-leridge s wild Rhyme have had aught to do with those mys-ti-cal im-pres-sions which were mine when I saw that bird up-on our deck For nei-ther had I then read the Rhyme nor knew the bird to be an al-ba-tross Yet in say-ing this I do but in-di-rect-ly bur-nish a lit-tle brighter the no-ble mer-it of the po-em and the poet I as-sert then that in the won-drous bod-i-ly white-ness of the bird chiefly lurks the se-cret of the spell a truth the more evinced in this that by a sole-cism of ter-ms there are birds called grey al-ba-tross-es and the-se I have fre-quent-ly seen but nev-er with such emo-tions as when I be-held the Antarc-tic fowl But how had the mys-tic thing been caught Whis-per it not and I will tell with a treach-er-ous hook and line as the fowl float-ed on the sea At last the Cap-tain made a post-man of it ty-ing a let-tered leath-ern tal-ly round its neck with the ship s time and place and then let-ting it es-cape But I doubt not that leath-ern tal-ly meant for man was tak-en off in Heav-en when the white fowl flew to join the wing fold-ing the in-vok-ing and ador-ing cheru-bim Most fa-mous in our Western an-nals and In-di-an tra-di-tions is that of the White Steed of the Prairies a mag-nif-i-cent milk white charg-er large eyed small head-ed bluff chest-ed and with the dig-ni-ty of a thou-sand monar-chs in his lofty over-scorn-ing car-riage He was the elect-ed Xerx-es of vast herds of wild hors-es whose pas-tures in those days were on-ly fenced by the Rocky Moun-tains and the Al-legha-nies At their flam-ing head he west-ward trooped it like that cho-sen star which ev-ery evening leads on the hosts of light The flash-ing cas-cade of his mane the curv-ing comet of his tail in-vest-ed him with hous-ings more re-splen-dent than gold and sil-ver beat-ers could have fur-nished him A most im-pe-ri-al and archangel-i-cal ap-pari-tion of that un-fal-l-en west-ern world which to the eyes of the old trap-pers and hunters re-vived the glo-ries of those primeval times when Adam walked ma-jes-tic as a god bluff browed and fear-less as this mighty steed Whether march-ing amid his aides and mar-shals in the van of count-less co-horts that end-less-ly streamed it over the plains like an Ohio or whether with his cir-cum-am-bi-ent sub-jec-ts brows-ing all around at the hori-zon the White Steed gal-lop-ing-ly re-viewed them with warm nos-trils red-den-ing through his cool milk-i-ness in what-ev-er as-pect he pre-sent-ed him-self al-ways to the bravest In-di-ans he was the ob-ject of trem-bling rev-er-ence and awe Nor can it be ques-tioned from what stands on leg-endary record of this no-ble horse that it was his spir-i-tu-al white-ness chiefly which so clothed him with di-vine-ness and that this di-vine-ness had that in it which though com-mand-ing wor-ship at the same time en-forced a cer-tain name-less ter-ror But there are oth-er in-stances where this white-ness los-es all that ac-ces-so-ry and strange glo-ry which in-vests it in the White Steed and Al-ba-tross What is it that in the Al-bi-no man so pe-cu-liar-ly re-pels and of-ten shocks the eye as that some-times he is loathed by his own kith and kin It is that white-ness which in-vests him a thing ex-pressed by the name he bears The Al-bi-no is as well made as oth-er men has no sub-stan-tive de-for-mi-ty and yet this mere as-pect of all per-vad-ing white-ness makes him more strange-ly hideous than the ugli-est abor-tion Why should this be so Nor in quite oth-er as-pec-ts does Na-ture in her least pal-pa-ble but not the less ma-li-cious agen-cies fail to en-list among her forces this crown-ing at-tribute of the ter-ri-ble From its snowy as-pect the gauntlet-ed ghost of the South-ern Seas has been de-nom-i-nat-ed the White Squall Nor in some his-toric in-stances has the art of hu-man mal-ice omit-ted so po-tent an aux-il-iary How wild-ly it height-ens the ef-fect of that pas-sage in Frois-sart when masked in the snowy sym-bol of their fac-tion the des-per-ate White Hoods of Ghent mur-der their bailiff in the mar-ket place Nor in some things does the com-mon hered-i-tary ex-pe-ri-ence of all mankind fail to bear wit-ness to the su-per-nat-u-ral-ism of this hue It can-not well be doubt-ed that the one vis-i-ble qual-i-ty in the as-pect of the dead which most ap-pals the gaz-er is the mar-ble pal-lor lin-ger-ing there as if in-deed that pal-lor were as much like the badge of con-ster-na-tion in the oth-er world as of mor-tal trep-i-da-tion here And from that pal-lor of the dead we bor-row the ex-pres-sive hue of the shroud in which we wrap them Nor even in our su-per-sti-tions do we fail to throw the same snowy mantle round our phan-toms all ghosts ris-ing in a milk white fog Yea while the-se ter-rors seize us let us add that even the king of ter-rors when per-son-i-fied by the evan-ge-list rides on his pal-lid horse There-fore in his oth-er moods sym-bol-ize what-ev-er grand or gra-cious thing he will by white-ness no man can deny that in its pro-foundest ide-al-ized sig-nif-i-cance it cal-ls up a pe-cu-liar ap-pari-tion to the soul But though with-out dis-sent this point be fixed how is mor-tal man to ac-count for it To anal-y-se it would seem im-pos-si-ble Can we then by the ci-ta-tion of some of those in-stances where-in this thing of white-ness though for the time ei-ther whol-ly or in great part stripped of all di-rect as-so-ci-a-tions cal-cu-lat-ed to im-part to it aught fear-ful but nev-er-the-less is found to ex-ert over us the same sor-cery how-ev-er mod-i-fied  can we thus hope to light up-on some chance clue to con-duct us to the hid-den cause we seek Let us try But in a mat-ter like this sub-tle-ty ap-peals to sub-tle-ty and with-out imag-i-na-tion no man can fol-low an-oth-er in-to the-se hal-ls And though doubtless some at least of the imag-i-na-tive im-pres-sions about to be pre-sent-ed may have been shared by most men yet few per-haps were en-tire-ly con-scious of them at the time and there-fore may not be able to re-call them now Why to the man of un-tu-tored ide-al-i-ty who hap-pens to be but loose-ly ac-quaint-ed with the pe-cu-liar char-ac-ter of the day does the bare men-tion of Whit-sun-tide mar-shal in the fan-cy such long drea-ry speech-less pro-ces-sions of slow pac-ing pil-grims down cast and hood-ed with new fal-l-en snow Or to the un-read un-so-phis-ti-cat-ed Protes-tant of the Mid-dle Amer-i-can States why does the pass-ing men-tion of a White Fri-ar or a White Nun evoke such an eye-less stat-ue in the soul Or what is there apart from the tra-di-tions of dun-geoned war-riors and kings which will not whol-ly ac-count for it that makes the White Tow-er of Lon-don tell so much more strong-ly on the imag-i-na-tion of an un-trav-elled Amer-i-can than those oth-er sto-ried struc-tures its neigh-bors the By-ward Tow-er or even the Bloody And those sub-limer tow-ers the White Moun-tains of New Hamp-shire whence in pe-cu-liar moods comes that gi-gan-tic ghost-li-ness over the soul at the bare men-tion of that name while the thought of Vir-gini-a s Blue Ridge is full of a soft dewy dis-tant dreami-ness Or why ir-re-spec-tive of all lat-i-tudes and lon-gi-tudes does the name of the White Sea ex-ert such a spec-tral-ness over the fan-cy while that of the Yel-low Sea lul-ls us with mor-tal thoughts of long lac-quered mild af-ter-noons on the waves fol-lowed by the gaud-i-est and yet sleepi-est of sun-sets Or to choose a whol-ly un-sub-stan-tial in-stance pure-ly ad-dressed to the fan-cy why in read-ing the old fairy tales of Cen-tral Europe does  the tall pale man of the Hartz forests whose change-less pal-lor un-rustling-ly glides through the green of the groves why is this phan-tom more ter-ri-ble than all the whoop-ing im-ps of the Blocks-burg Nor is it al-to-geth-er the re-mem-brance of her cathe-dral top-pling earth-quakes nor the stampe-does of her fran-tic seas nor the tear-less-ness of arid skies that nev-er rain nor the sight of her wide field of lean-ing spires wrenched cope stones and cross-es all adroop like cant-ed yards of an-chored fleets and her sub-ur-ban av-enues of house wal-ls ly-ing over up-on each oth-er as a tossed pack of cards  it is not the-se things alone which make tear-less Li-ma the strangest sad-dest city thou can st see For Li-ma has tak-en the white veil and there is a high-er hor-ror in this white-ness of her woe Old as Pizarro this white-ness keeps her ru-ins for ev-er new ad-mits not the cheer-ful green-ness of com-plete de-cay spreads over her bro-ken ram-parts the rigid pal-lor of an apoplexy that fix-es its own dis-tor-tions I know that to the com-mon ap-pre-hen-sion this phe-nomenon of white-ness is not con-fessed to be the prime agent in ex-ag-ger-at-ing the ter-ror of ob-jec-ts oth-er-wise ter-ri-ble nor to the unimag-i-na-tive mind is there aught of ter-ror in those ap-pear-ances whose aw-ful-ness to an-oth-er mind al-most sole-ly con-sists in this one phe-nomenon es-pe-cial-ly when ex-hib-it-ed un-der any form at all ap-proach-ing to mute-ness or uni-ver-sal-i-ty What I mean by the-se two state-men-ts may per-haps be re-spec-tive-ly elu-ci-dat-ed by the fol-low-ing ex-am-ples First The mariner when draw-ing nigh the coasts of for-eign lands if by night he hear the roar of break-ers starts to vig-i-lance and feels just enough of trep-i-da-tion to sharp-en all his fac-ul-ties but un-der pre-cise-ly sim-i-lar cir-cum-stances let him be called from his ham-mock to view his ship sail-ing through a mid-night sea of milky white-ness as if from en-cir-cling head-lands shoals of combed white bears were swim-ming round him then he feels a silent su-per-sti-tious dread the shroud-ed phan-tom of the whitened wa-ters is hor-ri-ble to him as a re-al ghost in vain the lead as-sures him he is still off sound-ings heart and helm they both go down he nev-er rests till blue wa-ter is un-der him again Yet where is the mariner who will tell thee  Sir it was not so much the fear of strik-ing hid-den rocks as the fear of that hideous white-ness that so stirred me  Se-cond To the na-tive In-di-an of Peru the con-tin-u-al sight of the snow how-da-hed An-des con-veys naught of dread ex-cept per-haps in the mere fan-cy-ing of the eter-nal frost-ed des-o-late-ness reign-ing at such vast al-ti-tudes and the nat-u-ral con-ceit of what a fear-ful-ness it would be to lose one-self in such in-hu-man soli-tudes Much the same is it with the back-woods-man of the West who with com-par-a-tive in-dif-fer-ence views an un-bound-ed prair-ie sheet-ed with driven snow no shad-ow of tree or twig to break the fixed trance of white-ness Not so the sailor be-hold-ing the scenery of the Antarc-tic seas where at times by some in-fer-nal trick of leg-erde-main in the pow-ers of frost and air he shiv-er-ing and half ship-wrecked in-stead of rain-bows speak-ing hope and so-lace to his mis-ery views what seems a bound-less church-yard grin-ning up-on him with its lean ice mon-u-men-ts and splin-tered cross-es But thou sayest me-thinks that white lead chap-ter about white-ness is but a white flag hung out from a craven soul thou sur-ren-der-est to a hy-po Ish-mael Tell me why this strong young colt foaled in some peace-ful val-ley of Ver-mont far re-moved from all beasts of prey why is it that up-on the sun-ni-est day if you but shake a fresh buf-falo robe be-hind him so that he can-not even see it but on-ly smells its wild an-i-mal musk-i-ness why will he start snort and with burst-ing eyes paw the ground in phren-sies of af-fright There is no re-mem-brance in him of any gor-ings of wild crea-tures in his green north-ern home so that the strange musk-i-ness he smells can-not re-call to him any-thing as-so-ci-at-ed with the ex-pe-ri-ence of for-mer per-ils for what knows he this New Eng-land colt of the black bisons of dis-tant Ore-gon No but here thou be-hold-est even in a dumb brute the in-stinct of the knowl-edge of the de-monism in the world Though thou-sands of miles from Ore-gon still when he smells that sav-age musk the rend-ing gor-ing bison herds are as pre-sent as to the de-sert-ed wild foal of the prairies which this in-stant they may be tram-pling in-to dust Thus then the muf-fled rollings of a milky sea the bleak rustlings of the fes-tooned frosts of moun-tains the des-o-late shift-ings of the windrowed snows of prairies all the-se to Ish-mael are as the shak-ing of that buf-falo robe to the fright-ened colt Though nei-ther knows where lie the name-less things of which the mys-tic sign gives forth such hin-ts yet with me as with the colt some-where those things must ex-ist Though in many of its as-pec-ts this vis-i-ble world seems formed in love the in-vis-i-ble spheres were formed in fright But not yet have we solved the in-can-ta-tion of this white-ness and learned why it ap-peals with such pow-er to the soul and more strange and far more por-ten-tous why as we have seen it is at on-ce the most mean-ing sym-bol of spir-i-tu-al things nay the very veil of the Chris-tian s De-ity and yet should be as it is the in-ten-si-fy-ing agent in things the most ap-palling to mankind Is it that by its in-def-i-nite-ness it shad-ows forth the heart-less voids and im-men-si-ties of the uni-verse and thus stabs us from be-hind with the thought of an-ni-hi-la-tion when be-hold-ing the white depths of the milky way Or is it that as in essence white-ness is not so much a colour as the vis-i-ble ab-sence of colour and at the same time the con-crete of all colours is it for the-se rea-sons that there is such a dumb blank-ness full of mean-ing in a wide land-scape of snows a colour-less all colour of athe-ism from which we shrink And when we con-sid-er that oth-er the-o-ry of the nat-u-ral philoso-phers that all oth-er earth-ly hues ev-ery state-ly or love-ly em-bla-zon-ing the sweet tinges of sun-set skies and woods yea and the gild-ed vel-vets of but-ter-flies and the but-ter-fly cheeks of young girls all the-se are but sub-tile de-ceits not ac-tu-al-ly in-her-ent in sub-stances but on-ly laid on from with-out so that all de-i-fied Na-ture ab-so-lute-ly paints like the har-lot whose al-lure-men-ts cov-er noth-ing but the char-nel house with-in and when we pro-ceed fur-ther and con-sid-er that the mys-ti-cal cos-met-ic which pro-duces ev-ery one of her hues the great prin-ci-ple of light for ev-er re-mains white or col-or-less in it-self and if op-er-at-ing with-out medi-um up-on mat-ter would touch all ob-jec-ts even tulips and ros-es with its own blank tinge pon-der-ing all this the palsied uni-verse lies be-fore us a lep-er and like wil-ful trav-ellers in La-p-land who re-fuse to wear coloured and colour-ing glass-es up-on their eyes so the wretched in-fi-del gazes him-self blind at the mon-u-men-tal white shroud that wraps all the prospect around him And of all the-se things the Al-bi-no whale was the sym-bol Won-der ye then at the fiery hunt CHAPTER 43 Hark  HIST Did you hear that noise Caba-co  It was the mid-dle watch a fair moon-light the sea-men were stand-ing in a cor-don ex-tend-ing from one of the fresh wa-ter but-ts in the waist to the scut-tle butt near the taffrail In this man-ner they passed the buck-ets to fill the scut-tle butt Stand-ing for the most part on the hal-lowed precinc-ts of the quar-ter deck they were care-ful not to speak or rustle their feet From hand to hand the buck-ets went in the deep-est si-lence on-ly bro-ken by the oc-ca-sion-al flap of a sail and the steady hum of the un-ceas-ing-ly ad-vanc-ing keel It was in the mid-st of this re-pose that Archy one of the cor-don whose post was near the af-ter hatch-es whis-pered to his neigh-bor a Cholo the words above  Hist did you hear that noise Caba-co   Take the buck-et will ye Archy what noise d ye mean   There it is again un-der the hatch-es don t you hear it a cough it sound-ed like a cough   Cough be damned Pass along that re-turn buck-et   There again there it is  it sounds like two or three sleep-ers turn-ing over now   Caram-ba have done ship-mate

that heard the hum of the old Quak-er-ess s knit-ting needles fifty miles at sea from Nan-tuck-et you re the chap   Grin away we ll see what turns up Hark ye Caba-co there is some-body down in the af-ter hold that has not yet been seen on deck and I sus-pect our old Mogul knows some-thing of it too I heard Stubb tell Flask one morn-ing watch that there was some-thing of that sort in the wind   Tish the buck-et  CHAPTER 44 The Chart Had you fol-lowed Cap-tain Ahab down in-to his cab-in af-ter the squall that took place on the night suc-ceed-ing that wild rat-i-fi-ca-tion of his pur-pose with his crew you would have seen him go to a lock-er in the tran-som and bring-ing out a large wrin-kled roll of yel-low-ish sea charts spread them be-fore him on his screwed down table Then seat-ing him-self be-fore it you would have seen him in-tent-ly study the var-i-ous lines and shad-ings which there met his eye and with slow but steady pen-cil trace ad-di-tion-al cours-es over spaces that be-fore were blank At in-ter-vals he would refer to piles of old log books beside him where-in were set down the sea-sons and places in which on var-i-ous for-mer voy-ages of var-i-ous ships sperm whales had been cap-tured or seen While thus em-ployed the heavy pewter lamp sus-pend-ed in chains over his head con-tin-u-al-ly rocked with the mo-tion of the ship and for ev-er threw shift-ing gleams and shad-ows of lines up-on his wrin-kled brow till it al-most seemed that while he him-self was mark-ing out lines and cours-es on the wrin-kled charts some in-vis-i-ble pen-cil was al-so trac-ing lines and cours-es up-on the deeply marked chart of his fore-head But it was not this night in par-tic-u-lar that in the soli-tude of his cab-in Ahab thus pon-dered over his charts Al-most ev-ery night they were brought out al-most ev-ery night some pen-cil marks were ef-faced and oth-ers were sub-sti-tut-ed For with the charts of all four oceans be-fore him Ahab was thread-ing a maze of cur-ren-ts and ed-dies with a view to the more cer-tain ac-com-plish-ment of that mono-ma-ni-ac thought of his soul Now to any one not ful-ly ac-quaint-ed with the ways of the leviathans it might seem an ab-surd-ly hope-less task thus to seek out one soli-tary crea-ture in the un-hooped oceans of this plan-et But not so did it seem to Ahab who knew the sets of all tides and cur-ren-ts and there-by cal-cu-lat-ing the drift-ings of the sperm whale s food and al-so call-ing to mind the reg-u-lar as-cer-tained sea-sons for hunt-ing him in par-tic-u-lar lat-i-tudes could ar-rive at rea-son-able sur-mis-es al-most ap-proach-ing to cer-tain-ties con-cern-ing the timeli-est day to be up-on this or that ground in search of his prey So as-sured in-deed is the fact con-cern-ing the pe-ri-od-i-cal-ness of the sperm whale s re-sort-ing to given wa-ters that many hunters be-lieve that could he be close-ly ob-served and stud-ied through-out the world were the logs for one voy-age of the en-tire whale fleet care-ful-ly col-lat-ed then the mi-gra-tions of the sperm whale would be found to cor-re-spond in in-vari-abil-i-ty to those of the her-ring shoals or the flights of swal-lows On this hint at-temp-ts have been made to con-struct elab-o-rate mi-gra-to-ry charts of the sperm whale Since the above was writ-ten the state-ment is hap-pi-ly borne out by an of-fi-cial cir-cu-lar is-sued by Lieu-tenant Mau-ry of the Na-tion-al Ob-ser-va-to-ry Wash-ing-ton April 16th 1851 By that cir-cu-lar it ap-pears that pre-cise-ly such a chart is in course of com-ple-tion and por-tions of it are pre-sent-ed in the cir-cu-lar  This chart di-vides the ocean in-to dis-tric-ts of five de-grees of lat-i-tude by five de-grees of lon-gi-tude per-pen-dic-u-lar-ly through each of which dis-tric-ts are twelve colum-ns for the twelve months and hor-i-zon-tal-ly through each of which dis-tric-ts are three lines one to show the num-ber of days that have been spent in each mon-th in ev-ery dis-trict and the two oth-ers to show the num-ber of days in which whales sperm or right have been seen  Be-sides when mak-ing a pas-sage from one feed-ing ground to an-oth-er the sperm whales guid-ed by some in-fal-li-ble in-stinc-t say rather se-cret in-tel-li-gence from the De-ity most-ly swim in veins as they are called con-tin-u-ing their way along a given ocean line with such un-de-vi-at-ing ex-ac-ti-tude that no ship ev-er sailed her course by any chart with one tithe of such mar-vel-lous pre-ci-sion Though in the-se cas-es the di-rec-tion tak-en by any one whale be straight as a sur-vey-or s par-al-lel and though the line of ad-vance be strict-ly con-fined to its own un-avoid-able straight wake yet the ar-bi-trary vein in which at the-se times he is said to swim gen-er-al-ly em-braces some few miles in width more or less as the vein is pre-sumed to ex-pand or con-tract but nev-er ex-ceeds the vi-su-al sweep from the whale ship s mast heads when cir-cum-spect-ly glid-ing along this mag-ic zone The sum is that at par-tic-u-lar sea-sons with-in that breadth and along that path mi-grat-ing whales may with great con-fi-dence be looked for And hence not on-ly at sub-stan-ti-at-ed times up-on well known sep-a-rate feed-ing grounds could Ahab hope to en-coun-ter his prey but in cross-ing the widest ex-pans-es of wa-ter be-tween those grounds he could by his art so place and time him-self on his way as even then not to be whol-ly with-out prospect of a meet-ing There was a cir-cum-stance which at first sight seemed to en-tan-gle his deliri-ous but still me-thod-i-cal scheme But not so in the re-al-i-ty per-haps Though the gre-gar-i-ous sperm whales have their reg-u-lar sea-sons for par-tic-u-lar grounds yet in gen-er-al you can-not con-clude that the herds which haunt-ed such and such a lat-i-tude or lon-gi-tude this year say will turn out to be iden-ti-cal-ly the same with those that were found there the pre-ced-ing sea-son though there are pe-cu-liar and un-ques-tion-able in-stances where the con-trary of this has proved true In gen-er-al the same re-mark on-ly with-in a less wide lim-it ap-plies to the soli-taries and her-mits among the ma-tured aged sperm whales So that though Moby Dick had in a for-mer year been seen for ex-am-ple on what is called the Sey-chelle ground in the In-di-an ocean or Vol-cano Bay on the Ja-pane-se Coast yet it did not fol-low that were the Pe-quod to vis-it ei-ther of those spots at any sub-se-quent cor-re-spond-ing sea-son she would in-fal-li-bly en-coun-ter him there So too with some oth-er feed-ing grounds where he had at times re-vealed him-self But all the-se seemed on-ly his ca-su-al stop-ping places and ocean in-ns so to speak not his places of pro-longed abode And where Ahab s chances of ac-com-plish-ing his ob-ject have hith-er-to been spo-ken of al-lu-sion has on-ly been made to what-ev-er way side an-tecedent ex-tra prospec-ts were his ere a par-tic-u-lar set time or place were at-tained when all pos-si-bil-i-ties would be-come prob-a-bil-i-ties and as Ahab fond-ly thought ev-ery pos-si-bil-i-ty the next thing to a cer-tain-ty That par-tic-u-lar set time and place were con-joined in the one tech-ni-cal phrase the Sea-son on the Line For there and then for sev-er-al con-sec-u-tive years Moby Dick had been pe-ri-od-i-cal-ly de-scried lin-ger-ing in those wa-ters for awhile as the sun in its an-nu-al round loi-ters for a pre-dict-ed in-ter-val in any one sign of the Zo-di-ac There it was too that most of the dead-ly en-coun-ters with the white whale had tak-en place there the waves were sto-ried with his deeds there al-so was that trag-ic spot where the mono-ma-ni-ac old man had found the aw-ful mo-tive to his vengeance But in the cau-tious com-pre-hen-sive-ness and un-loi-ter-ing vig-i-lance with which Ahab threw his brood-ing soul in-to this un-fal-ter-ing hunt he would not per-mit him-self to rest all his hopes up-on the one crown-ing fact above men-tioned how-ev-er flat-ter-ing it might be to those hopes nor in the sleep-less-ness of his vow could he so tran-quil-lize his un-qui-et heart as to post-pone all in-ter-ven-ing quest Now the Pe-quod had sailed from Nan-tuck-et at the very be-gin-ning of the Sea-son on the Line No pos-si-ble en-deav-or then could en-able her com-man-der to make the great pas-sage south-wards dou-ble Cape Horn and then run-ning down six-ty de-grees of lat-i-tude ar-rive in the equa-to-ri-al Paci-fic in time to cruise there There-fore he must wait for the next en-su-ing sea-son Yet the pre-ma-ture hour of the Pe-quod s sail-ing had per-haps been cor-rect-ly se-lect-ed by Ahab with a view to this very com-plex-ion of things Be-cause an in-ter-val of three hun-dred and six-ty five days and nights was be-fore him an in-ter-val which in-stead of im-pa-tient-ly en-dur-ing ashore he would spend in a mis-cel-la-neous hunt if by chance the White Whale spend-ing his va-ca-tion in seas far re-mote from his pe-ri-od-i-cal feed-ing grounds should turn up his wrin-kled brow off the Per-sian Gulf or in the Ben-gal Bay or Chi-na Seas or in any oth-er wa-ters haunt-ed by his race So that Mon-soons Pam-pas Nor Westers Har-mat-tans Trades any wind but the Le-van-ter and Si-moon might blow Moby Dick in-to the de-vi-ous zig zag world cir-cle of the Pe-quod s cir-cum-nav-i-gat-ing wake But grant-ing all this yet re-gard-ed dis-creet-ly and cool-ly seems it not but a mad idea this that in the broad bound-less ocean one soli-tary whale even if en-coun-tered should be thought ca-pa-ble of in-di-vid-u-al recog-ni-tion from his hunter even as a white beard-ed Mufti in the thronged thor-ough-fares of Con-stantino-ple Yes For the pe-cu-liar snow white brow of Moby Dick and his snow white hump could not but be un-mis-tak-able And have I not tal-lied the whale Ahab would mut-ter to him-self as af-ter por-ing over his charts till long af-ter mid-night he would throw him-self back in rever-ies tal-lied him and shall he es-cape His broad fins are bored and scal-loped out like a lost sheep s ear And here his mad mind would run on in a breath-less race till a weari-ness and faint-ness of pon-der-ing came over him and in the open air of the deck he would seek to re-cov-er his strength Ah God what trances of tor-men-ts does that man en-dure who is con-sumed with one un-achieved re-venge-ful de-sire He sleeps with clenched hands and wakes with his own bloody nails in his palms Often when forced from his ham-mock by ex-haust-ing and in-tol-er-a-bly vivid dreams of the night which re-sum-ing his own in-tense thoughts through the day car-ried them on amid a clash-ing of phren-sies and whirled them round and round and round in his blaz-ing brain till the very throb-bing of his life spot be-came in-suf-fer-able an-guish and when as was some-times the case the-se spir-i-tu-al throes in him heaved his be-ing up from its base and a chasm seemed open-ing in him from which forked flames and light-nings shot up and ac-cursed fiends beck-oned him to leap down among them when this hell in him-self yawned be-neath him a wild cry would be heard through the ship and with glar-ing eyes Ahab would burst from his state room as though es-cap-ing from a bed that was on fire Yet the-se per-haps in-stead of be-ing the un-sup-press-able symp-toms of some la-tent weak-ness or fright at his own re-solve were but the plainest to-kens of its in-ten-si-ty For at such times crazy Ahab the schem-ing un-ap-peas-ed-ly stead-fast hunter of the white whale this Ahab that had gone to his ham-mock was not the agent that so caused him to burst from it in hor-ror again The lat-ter was the eter-nal liv-ing prin-ci-ple or soul in him and in sleep be-ing for the time dis-so-ci-at-ed from the char-ac-ter-iz-ing mind which at oth-er times em-ployed it for its out-er ve-hi-cle or agent it spon-ta-neous-ly sought es-cape from the scorch-ing con-ti-gu-i-ty of the fran-tic thing of which for the time it was no longer an in-te-gral But as the mind does not ex-ist un-less leagued with the soul there-fore it must have been that in Ahab s case yield-ing up all his thoughts and fan-cies to his one supre-me pur-pose that pur-pose by its own sheer in-vet-er-a-cy of will forced it-self again-st gods and dev-ils in-to a kind of self as-sumed in-de-pen-dent be-ing of its own Nay could grim-ly live and burn while the com-mon vi-tal-i-ty to which it was con-joined fled hor-ror strick-en from the un-bid-den and un-fa-thered birth There-fore the tor-ment-ed spir-it that glared out of bod-i-ly eyes when what seemed Ahab rushed from his room was for the time but a va-cat-ed thing a form-less som-nam-bu-lis-tic be-ing a ray of liv-ing light to be sure but with-out an ob-ject to colour and there-fore a blank-ness in it-self God help thee old man thy thoughts have cre-at-ed a crea-ture in thee and he whose in-tense think-ing thus makes him a Prometheus a vul-ture feeds up-on that heart for ev-er that vul-ture the very crea-ture he cre-ates CHAPTER 45 The Af-fi-davit So far as what there may be of a nar-ra-tive in this book and in-deed as in-di-rect-ly touch-ing one or two very in-ter-est-ing and cu-ri-ous par-tic-u-lars in the habits of sperm whales the fore-go-ing chap-ter in its ear-lier part is as im-por-tant a one as will be found in this vol-ume but the lead-ing mat-ter of it re-quires to be still fur-ther and more fa-mil-iar-ly en-larged up-on in or-der to be ad-e-quate-ly un-der-stood and more-over to take away any in-creduli-ty which a pro-found ig-no-rance of the en-tire sub-ject may in-duce in some minds as to the nat-u-ral ver-i-ty of the main points of this af-fair I care not to per-form this part of my task me-thod-i-cal-ly but shall be con-tent to pro-duce the de-sired im-pres-sion by sep-a-rate ci-ta-tions of items prac-ti-cal-ly or re-li-ably known to me as a whale-man and from the-se ci-ta-tions I take it the con-clu-sion aimed at will nat-u-ral-ly fol-low of it-self First I have per-son-al-ly known three in-stances where a whale af-ter re-ceiv-ing a har-poon has ef-fect-ed a com-plete es-cape and af-ter an in-ter-val in one in-stance of three years has been again struck by the same hand and slain when the two irons both marked by the same pri-vate cypher have been tak-en from the body In the in-stance where three years in-ter-vened be-tween the fling-ing of the two har-poons and I think it may have been some-thing more than that the man who dart-ed them hap-pen-ing in the in-ter-val to go in a trad-ing ship on a voy-age to Africa went ashore there joined a dis-cov-ery par-ty and pen-e-trat-ed far in-to the in-te-ri-or where he trav-elled for a pe-ri-od of near-ly two years of-ten en-dan-gered by ser-pen-ts sav-ages tigers poi-sonous mi-as-mas with all the oth-er com-mon per-ils in-ci-dent to wan-der-ing in the heart of un-known re-gions Mean-while the whale he had struck must al-so have been on its trav-els no doubt it had thrice cir-cum-nav-i-gat-ed the globe brush-ing with its flanks all the coasts of Africa but to no pur-pose This man and this whale again came to-geth-er and the one van-quished the oth-er I say I my-self have known three in-stances sim-i-lar to this that is in two of them I saw the whales struck and up-on the sec-ond at-tack saw the two irons with the re-spec-tive marks cut in them af-ter-wards tak-en from the dead fish In the three year in-stance it so fell out that I was in the boat both times first and last and the last time dis-tinct-ly recog-nised a pe-cu-liar sort of huge mole un-der the whale s eye which I had ob-served there three years pre-vi-ous I say three years but I am pret-ty sure it was more than that Here are three in-stances then which I per-son-al-ly know the truth of but I have heard of many oth-er in-stances from per-sons whose ve-rac-i-ty in the mat-ter there is no good ground to im-peach Se-cond-ly It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fish-ery how-ev-er ig-no-rant the world ashore may be of it that there have been sev-er-al mem-o-rable his-tor-i-cal in-stances where a par-tic-u-lar whale in the ocean has been at dis-tant times and places pop-u-lar-ly cog-nis-able Why such a whale be-came thus marked was not al-to-geth-er and orig-i-nal-ly ow-ing to his bod-i-ly pe-cu-liar-i-ties as dis-tin-guished from oth-er whales for how-ev-er pe-cu-liar in that re-spect any chance whale may be they soon put an end to his pe-cu-liar-i-ties by killing him and boil-ing him down in-to a pe-cu-liar-ly valu-able oil No the rea-son was this that from the fa-tal ex-pe-ri-ences of the fish-ery there hung a ter-ri-ble pres-tige of per-ilous-ness about such a whale as there did about Ri-nal-do Ri-nal-dini in-so-much that most fish-er-men were con-tent to recog-nise him by mere-ly touch-ing their tarpaulins when he would be dis-cov-ered loung-ing by them on the sea with-out seek-ing to cul-ti-vate a more in-ti-mate ac-quain-tance Like some poor dev-ils ashore that hap-pen to know an iras-ci-ble great man they make dis-tant un-ob-tru-sive salu-ta-tions to him in the street lest if they pur-sued the ac-quain-tance fur-ther they might re-ceive a sum-ma-ry thump for their pre-sump-tion But not on-ly did each of the-se fa-mous whales en-joy great in-di-vid-u-al celebri-ty Nay you may call it an ocean wide renown not on-ly was he fa-mous in life and now is im-mor-tal in fore-castle sto-ries af-ter death but he was ad-mit-ted in-to all the rights priv-i-leges and dis-tinc-tions of a name had as much a name in-deed as Cam-by-ses or C sar Was it not so O Ti-mor Tom thou famed leviathan scarred like an ice-berg who so long did st lurk in the Ori-en-tal straits of that name whose spout was oft seen from the palmy beach of Om-bay Was it not so O New Zealand Jack thou ter-ror of all cruis-ers that crossed their wakes in the vicin-i-ty of the Tat-too Land Was it not so O Morquan King of Ja-pan whose lofty jet they say at times as-sumed the sem-blance of a snow white cross again-st the sky Was it not so O Don Miguel thou Chil-ian whale marked like an old tor-toise with mys-tic hi-ero-glyph-ics up-on the back In plain prose here are four whales as well known to the stu-den-ts of Ce-tacean His-to-ry as Mar-ius or Syl-la to the clas-sic schol-ar But this is not all New Zealand Tom and Don Miguel af-ter at var-i-ous times cre-at-ing great hav-oc among the boats of dif-fer-ent ves-sels were fi-nal-ly gone in quest of sys-tem-at-i-cal-ly hunt-ed out chased and killed by valiant whal-ing cap-tains who heaved up their an-chors with that ex-press ob-ject as much in view as in set-ting out through the Nar-ra-gansett Woods Cap-tain But-ler of old had it in his mind to cap-ture that no-to-ri-ous mur-der-ous sav-age An-na-won the head-most war-rior of the In-di-an King Philip I do not know where I can find a bet-ter place than just here to make men-tion of one or two oth-er things which to me seem im-por-tant as in print-ed form es-tab-lish-ing in all re-spec-ts the rea-son-able-ness of the whole sto-ry of the White Whale more es-pe-cial-ly the catas-tro-phe For this is one of those dis-heart-en-ing in-stances where truth re-quires full as much bol-ster-ing as er-ror So ig-no-rant are most lands-men of some of the plainest and most pal-pa-ble won-ders of the world that with-out some hin-ts touch-ing the plain fac-ts his-tor-i-cal and oth-er-wise of the fish-ery they might scout at Moby Dick as a mon-strous fa-ble or still worse and more de-testable a hideous and in-tol-er-a-ble al-le-go-ry First Though most men have some vague flit-ting ideas of the gen-er-al per-ils of the grand fish-ery yet they have noth-ing like a fixed vivid con-cep-tion of those per-ils and the fre-quen-cy with which they re-cur One rea-son per-haps is that not one in fifty of the ac-tu-al dis-as-ters and deaths by ca-su-alties in the fish-ery ev-er finds a pub-lic record at home how-ev-er tran-sient and im-me-di-ate-ly for-got-ten that record Do you sup-pose that that poor fel-low there who this mo-ment per-haps caught by the whale line off the coast of New Guinea is be-ing car-ried down to the bot-tom of the sea by the sound-ing leviathan do you sup-pose that that poor fel-low s name will ap-pear in the news-pa-per obit-u-ary you will read to mor-row at your break-fast No be-cause the mails are very ir-reg-u-lar be-tween here and New Guinea In fact did you ev-er hear what might be called reg-u-lar news di-rect or in-di-rect from New Guinea Yet I tell you that up-on one par-tic-u-lar voy-age which I made to the Paci-fic among many oth-ers we spoke thir-ty dif-fer-ent ships ev-ery one of which had had a death by a whale some of them more than one and three that had each lost a boat s crew For God s sake be eco-nom-i-cal with your lam-ps and can-dles not a gal-lon you burn but at least one drop of man s blood was spilled for it Se-cond-ly Peo-ple ashore have in-deed some in-def-i-nite idea that a whale is an enor-mous crea-ture of enor-mous pow-er but I have ev-er found that when nar-rat-ing to them some speci-fic ex-am-ple of this two fold enor-mous-ness they have sig-nif-i-cant-ly com-pli-ment-ed me up-on my face-tious-ness when I de-clare up-on my soul I had no more idea of be-ing face-tious than Mos-es when he wrote the his-to-ry of the plagues of Egypt But for-tu-nate-ly the spe-cial point I here seek can be es-tab-lished up-on tes-ti-mony en-tire-ly in-de-pen-dent of my own That point is this The Sperm Whale is in some cas-es suf-fi-cient-ly pow-er-ful know-ing and ju-di-cious-ly ma-li-cious as with di-rect afore-thought to stave in ut-ter-ly de-stroy and sink a large ship and what is more the Sperm Whale has done it First In the year 182 the ship Es-sex Cap-tain Pol-lard of Nan-tuck-et was cruis-ing in the Paci-fic Ocean One day she saw spouts low-ered her boats and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales Ere long sev-er-al of the whales were wound-ed when sud-den-ly a very large whale es-cap-ing from the boats is-sued from the shoal and bore di-rect-ly down up-on the ship Dash-ing his fore-head again-st her hull he so stove her in that in less than  ten min-utes she set-tled down and fell over Not a sur-viv-ing plank of her has been seen since After the sever-est ex-po-sure part of the crew reached the land in their boats Be-ing re-turned home at last Cap-tain Pol-lard on-ce more sailed for the Paci-fic in com-mand of an-oth-er ship but the gods ship-wrecked him again up-on un-known rocks and break-ers for the sec-ond time his ship was ut-ter-ly lost and forth-with for-swear-ing the sea he has nev-er tempt-ed it since At this day Cap-tain Pol-lard is a res-i-dent of Nan-tuck-et I have seen Owen Chace who was chief mate of the Es-sex at the time of the tragedy I have read his plain and faith-ful nar-ra-tive I have con-versed with his son and all this with-in a few miles of the scene of the catas-tro-phe The fol-low-ing are ex-trac-ts from Chace s nar-ra-tive  Every fact seemed to war-rant me in con-clud-ing that it was any-thing but chance which di-rect-ed his op-er-a-tions he made two sev-er-al at-tacks up-on the ship at a short in-ter-val be-tween them both of which ac-cord-ing to their di-rec-tion were cal-cu-lat-ed to do us the most in-jury by be-ing made ahead and there-by com-bin-ing the speed of the two ob-jec-ts for the shock to ef-fect which the ex-act man uvres which he made were nec-es-sary His as-pect was most hor-ri-ble and such as in-di-cat-ed re-sent-ment and fury He came di-rect-ly from the shoal which we had just be-fore en-tered and in which we had struck three of his com-pan-ions as if fired with re-venge for their suf-fer-ings  Again  At all even-ts the whole cir-cum-stances tak-en to-geth-er all hap-pen-ing be-fore my own eyes and pro-duc-ing at the time im-pres-sions in my mind of de-cid-ed cal-cu-lat-ing mis-chief on the part of the whale many of which im-pres-sions I can-not now re-call in-duce me to be sat-is-fied that I am cor-rect in my opin-ion  Here are his re-flec-tions some time af-ter quit-ting the ship dur-ing a black night in an open boat when al-most de-spair-ing of reach-ing any hos-pitable shore  The dark ocean and swelling wa-ters were noth-ing the fears of be-ing swal-lowed up by some dread-ful tem-pest or dashed up-on hid-den rocks with all the oth-er or-di-nary sub-jec-ts of fear-ful con-tem-pla-tion seemed scarce-ly en-ti-tled to a mo-men-t s thought the dis-mal look-ing wreck and the hor-rid as-pect and re-venge of the whale whol-ly en-grossed my re-flec-tions un-til day again made its ap-pear-ance  In an-oth-er place p 45  he speaks of  the mys-te-ri-ous and mor-tal at-tack of the an-i-mal  Se-cond-ly The ship Union al-so of Nan-tuck-et was in the year 187 to-tal-ly lost off the Azores by a sim-i-lar on-set but the au-then-tic par-tic-u-lars of this catas-tro-phe I have nev-er chanced to en-coun-ter though from the whale hunters I have now and then heard ca-su-al al-lu-sions to it Third-ly Some eigh-teen or twen-ty years ago Com-modore J  then com-mand-ing an Amer-i-can sloop of war of the first class hap-pened to be din-ing with a par-ty of whal-ing cap-tains on board a Nan-tuck-et ship in the har-bor of Oahu Sand-wich Is-lands Con-ver-sa-tion turn-ing up-on whales the Com-modore was pleased to be scep-ti-cal touch-ing the amaz-ing strength as-cribed to them by the pro-fes-sion-al gen-tle-men pre-sent He peremp-to-ri-ly de-nied for ex-am-ple that any whale could so smite his stout sloop of war as to cause her to leak so much as a thim-ble-ful Very good but there is more com-ing Some weeks af-ter the Com-modore set sail in this im-preg-nable craft for Val-paraiso But he was stopped on the way by a port-ly sperm whale that begged a few mo-ments con-fi-den-tial busi-ness with him That busi-ness con-sist-ed in fetch-ing the Com-modor-e s craft such a thwack that with all his pumps go-ing he made straight for the near-est port to heave down and re-pair I am not su-per-sti-tious but I con-sid-er the Com-modor-e s in-ter-view with that whale as prov-i-den-tial Was not Saul of Tar-sus con-vert-ed from un-be-lief by a sim-i-lar fright I tell you the sperm whale will stand no non-sense I will now refer you to Langs-dorf-f s Voy-ages for a lit-tle cir-cum-stance in point pe-cu-liar-ly in-ter-est-ing to the writer here-of Langs-dorff you must know by the way was at-tached to the Rus-sian Ad-mi-ral Krusen-stern s fa-mous Dis-cov-ery Ex-pe-di-tion in the be-gin-ning of the pre-sent cen-tu-ry Cap-tain Langs-dorff thus be-gins his sev-en-teen-th chap-ter  By the thir-teen-th of May our ship was ready to sail and the next day we were out in the open sea on our way to Ochot-sh The weath-er was very clear and fine but so in-tol-er-a-bly cold that we were obliged to keep on our fur cloth-ing For some days we had very lit-tle wind it was not till the nine-teen-th that a brisk gale from the north-west sprang up An un-com-mon large whale the body of which was larg-er than the ship it-self lay al-most at the sur-face of the wa-ter but was not per-ceived by any one on board till the mo-ment when the ship which was in full sail was al-most up-on him so that it was im-pos-si-ble to pre-vent its strik-ing again-st him We were thus placed in the most im-mi-nent dan-ger as this gi-gan-tic crea-ture set-ting up its back raised the ship three feet at least out of the wa-ter The mas-ts reeled and the sails fell al-to-geth-er while we who were be-low all sprang in-stant-ly up-on the deck con-clud-ing that we had struck up-on some rock in-stead of this we saw the mon-ster sail-ing off with the ut-most grav-i-ty and solem-ni-ty Cap-tain D Wolf ap-plied im-me-di-ate-ly to the pumps to ex-am-ine whether or not the ves-sel had re-ceived any dam-age from the shock but we found that very hap-pi-ly it had es-caped en-tire-ly un-in-jured  Now the Cap-tain D Wolf here al-lud-ed to as com-mand-ing the ship in ques-tion is a New Eng-lan-der who af-ter a long life of un-usu-al ad-ven-tures as a sea cap-tain this day re-sides in the vil-lage of Dorch-ester near Bos-ton I have the hon-or of be-ing a nephew of his I have par-tic-u-lar-ly ques-tioned him con-cern-ing this pas-sage in Langs-dorff He sub-stan-ti-ates ev-ery word The ship how-ev-er was by no means a large one a Rus-sian craft built on the Siberi-an coast and pur-chased by my un-cle af-ter bar-ter-ing away the ves-sel in which he sailed from home In that up and down man-ly book of old fash-ioned ad-ven-ture so full too of hon-est won-der-s the voy-age of Lionel Wafer one of an-cient Dampier s old chum-s I found a lit-tle mat-ter set down so like that just quot-ed from Langs-dorff that I can-not for-bear in-sert-ing it here for a cor-rob-o-ra-tive ex-am-ple if such be need-ed Lionel it seems was on his way to  John Fer-di-nan-do  as he cal-ls the mod-ern Juan Fer-nan-des  In our way thith-er  he says  about four o clock in the morn-ing when we were about one hun-dred and fifty leagues from the Main of Amer-i-ca our ship felt a ter-ri-ble shock which put our men in such con-ster-na-tion that they could hard-ly tell where they were or what to think but ev-ery one be-gan to pre-pare for death And in-deed the shock was so sud-den and vi-o-lent that we took it for grant-ed the ship had struck again-st a rock but when the amaze-ment was a lit-tle over we cast the lead and sound-ed but found no ground The sud-den-ness of the shock made the guns leap in their car-riages and sev-er-al of the men were shak-en out of their ham-mocks Cap-tain Dav-is who lay with his head on a gun was thrown out of his cab-in  Lionel then goes on to im-pute the shock to an earth-quake and seems to sub-stan-ti-ate the im-pu-ta-tion by stat-ing that a great earth-quake some-where about that time did ac-tu-al-ly do great mis-chief along the Span-ish land But I should not much won-der if in the dark-ness of that ear-ly hour of the morn-ing the shock was af-ter all caused by an un-seen whale ver-ti-cal-ly bump-ing the hull from be-neath I might pro-ceed with sev-er-al more ex-am-ples one way or an-oth-er known to me of the great pow-er and mal-ice at times of the sperm whale In more than one in-stance he has been known not on-ly to chase the as-sail-ing boats back to their ships but to pur-sue the ship it-self and long with-stand all the lances hurled at him from its decks The English ship Pusie Hall can tell a sto-ry on that head and as for his strength let me say that there have been ex-am-ples where the lines at-tached to a run-ning sperm whale have in a calm been trans-ferred to the ship and se-cured there the whale tow-ing her great hull through the wa-ter as a horse walks off with a cart Again it is very of-ten ob-served that if the sperm whale on-ce struck is al-lowed time to ral-ly he then ac-ts not so of-ten with blind rage as with wil-ful de-lib-er-ate de-signs of de-struc-tion to his pur-suers nor is it with-out con-vey-ing some elo-quent in-di-ca-tion of his char-ac-ter that up-on be-ing at-tacked he will fre-quent-ly open his mouth and re-tain it in that dread ex-pan-sion for sev-er-al con-sec-u-tive min-utes But I must be con-tent with on-ly one more and a con-clud-ing il-lus-tra-tion a re-mark-able and most sig-nif-i-cant one by which you will not fail to see that not on-ly is the most mar-vel-lous event in this book cor-rob-o-rat-ed by plain fac-ts of the pre-sent day but that the-se mar-vels like all mar-vels are mere rep-e-ti-tions of the ages so that for the mil-lion-th time we say amen with Solomon Ver-i-ly there is noth-ing new un-der the sun In the six-th Chris-tian cen-tu-ry lived Pro-copius a Chris-tian mag-is-trate of Con-stantino-ple in the days when Jus-tini-an was Em-per-or and Belis-ar-ius gen-er-al As many know he wrote the his-to-ry of his own times a work ev-ery way of un-com-mon val-ue By the best au-thor-i-ties he has al-ways been con-sid-ered a most trust-wor-thy and un-ex-ag-ger-at-ing his-to-ri-an ex-cept in some one or two par-tic-u-lars not at all af-fect-ing the mat-ter present-ly to be men-tioned Now in this his-to-ry of his Pro-copius men-tions that dur-ing the term of his pre-fec-ture at Con-stantino-ple a great sea mon-ster was cap-tured in the neigh-bor-ing Pro-pon-tis or Sea of Mar-mora af-ter hav-ing de-stroyed ves-sels at in-ter-vals in those wa-ters for a pe-ri-od of more than fifty years A fact thus set down in sub-stan-tial his-to-ry can-not eas-i-ly be gain-said Nor is there any rea-son it should be Of what pre-cise species this sea mon-ster was is not men-tioned But as he de-stroyed ships as well as for oth-er rea-sons he must have been a whale and I am strong-ly in-clined to think a sperm whale And I will tell you why For a long time I fan-cied that the sperm whale had been al-ways un-known in the Mediter-ranean and the deep wa-ters con-nect-ing with it Even now I am cer-tain that those seas are not and per-haps nev-er can be in the pre-sent con-sti-tu-tion of things a place for his ha-bit-u-al gre-gar-i-ous re-sort But fur-ther in-ves-ti-ga-tions have re-cent-ly proved to me that in mod-ern times there have been iso-lat-ed in-stances of the pres-ence of the sperm whale in the Mediter-ranean I am told on good au-thor-i-ty that on the Bar-bary coast a Com-modore Dav-is of the Bri-tish navy found the skele-ton of a sperm whale Now as a ves-sel of war read-i-ly pass-es through the Dar-danelles hence a sperm whale could by the same route pass out of the Mediter-ranean in-to the Pro-pon-tis In the Pro-pon-tis as far as I can learn none of that pe-cu-liar sub-stance called brit is to be found the al-i-ment of the right whale But I have ev-ery rea-son to be-lieve that the food of the sperm whale squid or cut-tle fish lurks at the bot-tom of that sea be-cause large crea-tures but by no means the largest of that sort have been found at its sur-face If then you prop-er-ly put the-se state-men-ts to-geth-er and rea-son up-on them a bit you will clear-ly per-ceive that ac-cord-ing to all hu-man rea-son-ing Pro-copius s sea mon-ster that for half a cen-tu-ry stove the ships of a Ro-man Em-per-or must in all prob-a-bil-i-ty have been a sperm whale CHAPTER 46 Sur-mis-es Though con-sumed with the hot fire of his pur-pose Ahab in all his thoughts and ac-tions ev-er had in view the ul-ti-mate cap-ture of Moby Dick though he seemed ready to sac-ri-fice all mor-tal in-ter-ests to that one pas-sion nev-er-the-less it may have been that he was by na-ture and long ha-bit-u-a-tion far too wed-ded to a fiery whale-man s ways al-to-geth-er to aban-don the col-lat-er-al pros-e-cu-tion of the voy-age Or at least if this were oth-er-wise there were not want-ing oth-er mo-tives much more in-flu-en-tial with him It would be re-fin-ing too much per-haps even con-sid-er-ing his mono-ma-nia to hint that his vin-dic-tive-ness to-wards the White Whale might have pos-si-bly ex-tend-ed it-self in some de-gree to all sperm whales and that the more mon-sters he slew by so much the more he mul-ti-plied the chances that each sub-se-quent-ly en-coun-tered whale would prove to be the hat-ed one he hunt-ed But if such an hy-poth-e-sis be in-deed ex-cep-tion-able there were still ad-di-tion-al con-sid-er-a-tions which though not so strict-ly ac-cord-ing with the wild-ness of his rul-ing pas-sion yet were by no means in-ca-pable of sway-ing him To ac-com-plish his ob-ject Ahab must use tools and of all tools used in the shad-ow of the moon men are most apt to get out of or-der He knew for ex-am-ple that how-ev-er mag-net-ic his as-cen-den-cy in some re-spec-ts was over Star-buck yet that as-cen-den-cy did not cov-er the com-plete spir-i-tu-al man any more than mere cor-po-re-al su-pe-ri-or-i-ty in-volves in-tel-lec-tu-al mas-ter-ship for to the pure-ly spir-i-tu-al the in-tel-lec-tu-al but stand in a sort of cor-po-re-al re-la-tion Star-buck s body and Star-buck s co-erced will were Ahab s so long as Ahab kept his mag-net at Star-buck s brain still he knew that for all this the chief mate in his soul ab-horred his cap-tain s quest and could he would joy-ful-ly dis-in-te-grate him-self from it or even frus-trate it It might be that a long in-ter-val would elapse ere the White Whale was seen Dur-ing that long in-ter-val Star-buck would ev-er be apt to fall in-to open re-laps-es of re-bel-lion again-st his cap-tain s lead-er-ship un-less some or-di-nary pru-den-tial cir-cum-stan-tial in-flu-ences were brought to bear up-on him Not on-ly that but the sub-tle in-san-i-ty of Ahab re-spect-ing Moby Dick was noways more sig-nif-i-cant-ly man-i-fest-ed than in his su-perla-tive sense and shrewd-ness in fore-see-ing that for the pre-sent the hunt should in some way be stripped of that strange imag-i-na-tive im-pi-ous-ness which nat-u-ral-ly in-vest-ed it that the full ter-ror of the voy-age must be kept with-drawn in-to the ob-scure back-ground for few men s courage is proof again-st pro-tract-ed med-i-ta-tion un-re-lieved by ac-tion that when they stood their long night watch-es his of-fi-cers and men must have some nearer things to think of than Moby Dick For how-ev-er ea-ger-ly and im-petu-ous-ly the sav-age crew had hailed the an-nounce-ment of his quest yet all sailors of all sorts are more or less capri-cious and un-re-li-able they live in the vary-ing out-er weath-er and they in-hale its fick-le-ness and when re-tained for any ob-ject re-mote and blank in the pur-suit how-ev-er promis-so-ry of life and pas-sion in the end it is above all things req-ui-site that tem-po-rary in-ter-ests and em-ploy-men-ts should in-ter-vene and hold them healthi-ly sus-pend-ed for the fi-nal dash Nor was Ahab un-mind-ful of an-oth-er thing In times of strong emo-tion mankind dis-dain all base con-sid-er-a-tions but such times are evanes-cent The per-ma-nent con-sti-tu-tion-al con-di-tion of the man-u-fac-tured man thought Ahab is sor-did-ness Grant-ing that the White Whale ful-ly in-cites the hearts of this my sav-age crew and play-ing round their sav-age-ness even breeds a cer-tain gen-er-ous knight er-ran-tism in them still while for the love of it they give chase to Moby Dick they must al-so have food for their more com-mon dai-ly ap-petites For even the high lift-ed and chival-ric Cru-saders of old times were not con-tent to tra-verse two thou-sand miles of land to fight for their holy sepul-chre with-out com-mit-ting bur-glar-ies pick-ing pock-ets and gain-ing oth-er pi-ous perquisites by the way Had they been strict-ly held to their one fi-nal and ro-man-tic ob-jec-t that fi-nal and ro-man-tic ob-ject too many would have turned from in dis-gust I will not strip the-se men thought Ahab of all hopes of cash aye cash They may scorn cash now but let some months go by and no per-spec-tive promise of it to them and then this same qui-es-cent cash all at on-ce mutiny-ing in them this same cash would soon cashier Ahab Nor was there want-ing still an-oth-er pre-cau-tion-ary mo-tive more re-lat-ed to Ahab per-son-al-ly Hav-ing im-pul-sive-ly it is prob-a-ble and per-haps some-what pre-ma-ture-ly re-vealed the prime but pri-vate pur-pose of the Pe-quod s voy-age Ahab was now en-tire-ly con-scious that in so do-ing he had in-di-rect-ly laid him-self open to the unan-swer-able charge of usurpa-tion and with per-fect im-puni-ty both moral and legal his crew if so dis-posed and to that end com-pe-tent could re-fuse all fur-ther obe-di-ence to him and even vi-o-lent-ly wrest from him the com-mand From even the bare-ly hint-ed im-pu-ta-tion of usurpa-tion and the pos-si-ble con-se-quences of such a sup-pressed im-pres-sion gain-ing ground Ahab must of course have been most anx-ious to pro-tect him-self That pro-tec-tion could on-ly con-sist in his own pre-dom-i-nat-ing brain and heart and hand backed by a heed-ful close-ly cal-cu-lat-ing at-ten-tion to ev-ery min-ute at-mo-spher-ic in-flu-ence which it was pos-si-ble for his crew to be sub-ject-ed to For all the-se rea-sons then and oth-ers per-haps too an-a-lyt-ic to be ver-bal-ly de-vel-oped here Ahab plain-ly saw that he must still in a good de-gree con-tin-ue true to the nat-u-ral nom-i-nal pur-pose of the Pe-quod s voy-age ob-serve all cus-tom-ary us-ages and not on-ly that but force him-self to evince all his well known pas-sion-ate in-ter-est in the gen-er-al pur-suit of his pro-fes-sion Be all this as it may his voice was now of-ten heard hail-ing the three mast heads and ad-mon-ish-ing them to keep a bright look out and not omit re-port-ing even a por-poise This vig-i-lance was not long with-out re-ward CHAPTER 47 The Mat Mak-er It was a cloudy sul-try af-ter-noon the sea-men were lazi-ly loung-ing about the decks or va-cant-ly gaz-ing over in-to the lead coloured wa-ters Quee-queg and I were mild-ly em-ployed weav-ing what is called a sword mat for an ad-di-tion-al lash-ing to our boat So still and sub-dued and yet some-how pre-lud-ing was all the scene and such an in-can-ta-tion of rever-ie lurked in the air that each silent sailor seemed re-solved in-to his own in-vis-i-ble self I was the at-ten-dant or page of Quee-queg while busy at the mat As I kept pass-ing and repass-ing the fill-ing or woof of mar-line be-tween the long yarns of the warp us-ing my own hand for the shut-tle and as Quee-queg stand-ing side-ways ev-er and anon slid his heavy oak-en sword be-tween the threads and idly look-ing off up-on the wa-ter care-less-ly and un-think-ing-ly drove home ev-ery yarn I say so strange a dreami-ness did there then reign all over the ship and all over the sea on-ly bro-ken by the in-ter-mit-ting dull sound of the sword that it seemed as if this were the Loom of Time and I my-self were a shut-tle me-chan-i-cal-ly weav-ing and weav-ing away at the Fates There lay the fixed threads of the warp sub-ject to but one sin-gle ev-er re-turn-ing un-chang-ing vi-bra-tion and that vi-bra-tion mere-ly enough to ad-mit of the cross-wise in-terblend-ing of oth-er threads with its own This warp seemed ne-ces-si-ty and here thought I with my own hand I ply my own shut-tle and weave my own des-tiny in-to the-se un-al-ter-able threads Mean-time Quee-queg s im-pul-sive in-dif-fer-ent sword some-times hit-ting the woof slant-ing-ly or crooked-ly or strong-ly or weak-ly as the case might be and by this dif-fer-ence in the con-clud-ing blow pro-duc-ing a cor-re-spond-ing con-trast in the fi-nal as-pect of the com-plet-ed fab-ric this sav-age s sword thought I which thus fi-nal-ly shapes and fash-ions both warp and woof this easy in-dif-fer-ent sword must be chance aye chance free will and ne-ces-si-ty no-wise in-com-pat-i-ble all in-ter-weav-ing-ly work-ing to-geth-er The straight warp of ne-ces-si-ty not to be swerved from its ul-ti-mate course its ev-ery al-ter-nat-ing vi-bra-tion in-deed on-ly tend-ing to that free will still free to ply her shut-tle be-tween given threads and chance though re-strained in its play with-in the right lines of ne-ces-si-ty and side-ways in its mo-tions di-rect-ed by free will though thus pre-scribed to by both chance by turns rules ei-ther and has the last fea-tur-ing blow at even-ts Thus we were weav-ing and weav-ing away when I start-ed at a sound so strange long drawn and mu-si-cal-ly wild and un-earth-ly that the ball of free will dropped from my hand and I stood gaz-ing up at the clouds whence that voice dropped like a wing High aloft in the cross trees was that mad Gay Head-er Tashte-go His body was reach-ing ea-ger-ly for-ward his hand stretched out like a wand and at brief sud-den in-ter-vals he con-tin-ued his cries To be sure the same sound was that very mo-ment per-haps be-ing heard all over the seas from hun-dreds of whale-men s look outs perched as high in the air but from few of those lungs could that ac-cus-tomed old cry have de-rived such a mar-vel-lous ca-dence as from Tashte-go the In-di-an s As he stood hov-er-ing over you half sus-pend-ed in air so wild-ly and ea-ger-ly peer-ing to-wards the hori-zon you would have thought him some prophet or seer be-hold-ing the shad-ows of Fate and by those wild cries an-nounc-ing their com-ing  There she blows there there there she blows she blows   Where away   On the lee beam about two miles off a school of them  In-stant-ly all was com-mo-tion The Sperm Whale blows as a clock ticks with the same un-de-vi-at-ing and re-li-able uni-for-mi-ty And there-by whale-men dis-tin-guish this fish from oth-er tribes of his genus  There go flukes  was now the cry from Tashte-go and the whales dis-ap-peared  Quick stew-ard  cried Ahab  Time time  Dough Boy hur-ried be-low glanced at the watch and re-port-ed the ex-act min-ute to Ahab The ship was now kept away from the wind and she went gen-tly rolling be-fore it Tashte-go re-port-ing that the whales had gone down head-ing to lee-ward we con-fi-dent-ly looked to see them again di-rect-ly in ad-vance of our bows For that sin-gu-lar craft at times evinced by the Sperm Whale when sound-ing with his head in one di-rec-tion he nev-er-the-less while con-cealed be-neath the sur-face mil-ls round and swift-ly swims off in the op-po-site quar-ter this de-ceit-ful-ness of his could not now be in ac-tion for there was no rea-son to sup-pose that the fish seen by Tashte-go had been in any way alarmed or in-deed knew at all of our vicin-i-ty One of the men se-lect-ed for ship-keep-er-s that is those not ap-point-ed to the boats by this time re-lieved the In-di-an at the main mast head The sailors at the fore and mizzen had come down the line tubs were fixed in their places the cranes were thrust out the main-yard was backed and the three boats swung over the sea like three sam-phire bas-kets over high cliffs Out-side of the bul-warks their ea-ger crews with one hand clung to the rail while one foot was ex-pec-tant-ly poised on the gun-wale So look the long line of man of war s men about to throw them-selves on board an en-e-my s ship But at this crit-i-cal in-stant a sud-den ex-cla-ma-tion was heard that took ev-ery eye from the whale With a start all glared at dark Ahab who was sur-round-ed by five dusky phan-toms that seemed fresh formed out of air CHAPTER 48 The First Low-er-ing The phan-toms for so they then seemed were flit-ting on the oth-er side of the deck and with a noise-less celer-i-ty were cast-ing loose the tack-les and bands of the boat which swung there This boat had al-ways been deemed one of the spare boats though tech-ni-cal-ly called the cap-tain s on ac-count of its hang-ing from the star-board quar-ter The fig-ure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart with one white tooth evil-ly pro-trud-ing from its steel like lips A rum-pled Chi-ne-se jack-et of black cot-ton fu-ne-re-al-ly in-vest-ed him with wide black trowsers of the same dark stuff But strange-ly crown-ing this ebon-ness was a glis-ten-ing white plait-ed tur-ban the liv-ing hair braid-ed and coiled round and round up-on his head Less swart in as-pect the com-pan-ions of this fig-ure were of that vivid tiger yel-low com-plex-ion pe-cu-liar to some of the abo-rig-i-nal na-tives of the Manil-las  a race no-to-ri-ous for a cer-tain di-a-bolism of sub-tilty and by some hon-est white mariners sup-posed to be the paid spies and se-cret con-fi-den-tial agen-ts on the wa-ter of the dev-il their lord whose count-ing room they sup-pose to be else-where While yet the won-der-ing ship s com-pa-ny were gaz-ing up-on the-se strangers Ahab cried out to the white tur-baned old man at their head  All ready there Fedal-lah   Ready  was the half hissed re-ply  Low-er away then d ye hear  shout-ing across the deck  Low-er away there I say  Such was the thun-der of his voice that spite of their amaze-ment the men sprang over the rail the sheaves whirled round in the blocks with a wal-low the three boats dropped in-to the sea while with a dex-ter-ous off hand-ed dar-ing un-known in any oth-er vo-ca-tion the sailors goat like leaped down the rolling ship s side in-to the tossed boats be-low Hard-ly had they pulled out from un-der the ship s lee when a fourth keel com-ing from the wind-ward side pulled round un-der the stern and showed the five strangers row-ing Ahab who stand-ing erect in the stern loud-ly hailed Star-buck Stubb and Flask to spread them-selves wide-ly so as to cov-er a large ex-panse of wa-ter But with all their eyes again riv-et-ed up-on the swart Fedal-lah and his crew the in-mates of the oth-er boats obeyed not the com-mand  Cap-tain Ahab   said Star-buck  Spread your-selves  cried Ahab  give way all four boats Thou Flask pull out more to lee-ward   Aye aye sir  cheer-i-ly cried lit-tle King Post sweep-ing round his great steer-ing oar  Lay back  ad-dress-ing his crew  There  there  there again There she blows right ahead boys  lay back   Nev-er heed yon-der yel-low boys Archy   Oh I don t mind  em sir  said Archy  I knew it all be-fore now Did-n t I hear  em in the hold And did-n t I tell Caba-co here of it What say ye Caba-co They are stow-aways Mr Flask   Pull pull my fine hearts alive pull my chil-dren pull my lit-tle ones  drawl-ing-ly and sooth-ing-ly sighed Stubb to his crew some of whom still showed signs of un-easi-ness  Why don t you break your back-bones my boys What is it you stare at Those chaps in yon-der boat Tut They are on-ly five more hands come to help us nev-er mind from where the more the mer-ri-er Pull then do pull nev-er mind the brim-stone dev-ils are good fel-lows enough So so there you are now that s the stroke for a thou-sand pounds that s the stroke to sweep the stakes Hur-rah for the gold cup of sperm oil my heroes Three cheers men all hearts alive Easy easy don t be in a hur-ry don t be in a hur-ry Why don t you snap your oars you ras-cals Bite some-thing you dogs So so so then  soft-ly soft-ly That s it that s it long and strong Give way there give way The dev-il fetch ye ye raga-muffin rap-scal-lions ye are all asleep Stop snor-ing ye sleep-ers and pull Pull will ye pull can t ye pull won t ye Why in the name of gud-geons and gin-ger cakes don t ye pull  pull and break some-thing pull and start your eyes out Here  whip-ping out the sharp knife from his girdle  ev-ery moth-er s son of ye draw his knife and pull with the blade be-tween his teeth That s it that s it Now ye do some-thing that looks like it my steel bits Start her start her my sil-ver spoons Start her mar-ling spikes  Stub-b s ex-ordi-um to his crew is given here at large be-cause he had rather a pe-cu-liar way of talk-ing to them in gen-er-al and es-pe-cial-ly in in-cul-cat-ing the re-li-gion of row-ing But you must not sup-pose from this spec-i-men of his ser-mo-niz-ings that he ev-er flew in-to down-right pas-sions with his con-gre-ga-tion Not at all and there-in con-sist-ed his chief pe-cu-liar-i-ty He would say the most ter-ri-fic things to his crew in a tone so strange-ly com-pound-ed of fun and fury and the fury seemed so cal-cu-lat-ed mere-ly as a spice to the fun that no oars-man could hear such queer in-vo-ca-tions with-out pulling for dear life and yet pulling for the mere joke of the thing Be-sides he all the time looked so easy and in-do-lent him-self so loung-ing-ly man-aged his steer-ing oar and so broad-ly gaped open mouthed at times that the mere sight of such a yawn-ing com-man-der by sheer force of con-trast act-ed like a charm up-on the crew Then again Stubb was one of those odd sort of hu-morists whose jol-li-ty is some-times so cu-ri-ous-ly am-bigu-ous as to put all in-fe-ri-ors on their guard in the mat-ter of obey-ing them In obe-di-ence to a sign from Ahab Star-buck was now pulling oblique-ly across Stub-b s bow and when for a min-ute or so the two boats were pret-ty near to each oth-er Stubb hailed the mate  Mr Star-buck lar-board boat there ahoy a word with ye sir if ye please   Hal-loa  re-turned Star-buck turn-ing round not a sin-gle inch as he spoke still earnest-ly but whis-per-ing-ly urg-ing his crew his face set like a flint from Stub-b s  What think ye of those yel-low boys sir   Smug-gled on board some-how be-fore the ship sailed Strong strong boys  in a whis-per to his crew then speak-ing out loud again  A sad busi-ness Mr Stubb seethe her seethe her my lads but nev-er mind Mr Stubb all for the best Let all your crew pull strong come what will Spring my men spring There s hogsheads of sperm ahead Mr Stubb and that s what ye came for Pull my boys Sperm sper-m s the play This at least is du-ty du-ty and prof-it hand in hand   Aye aye I thought as much  so-lil-o-quized Stubb when the boats di-verged  as soon as I clapt eye on  em I thought so Aye and that s what he went in-to the af-ter hold for so of-ten as Dough Boy long sus-pect-ed They were hid-den down there The White Whale s at the bot-tom of it Well well so be it Can t be helped All right Give way men It ain t the White Whale to day Give way  Now the ad-vent of the-se out-landish strangers at such a crit-i-cal in-stant as the low-er-ing of the boats from the deck this had not un-rea-son-ably awak-ened a sort of su-per-sti-tious amaze-ment in some of the ship s com-pa-ny but Archy s fan-cied dis-cov-ery hav-ing some time pre-vi-ous got abroad among them though in-deed not cred-it-ed then this had in some small mea-sure pre-pared them for the event It took off the ex-treme edge of their won-der and so what with all this and Stub-b s con-fi-dent way of ac-count-ing for their ap-pear-ance they were for the time freed from su-per-sti-tious sur-mis-ings though the af-fair still left abun-dant room for all man-ner of wild con-jec-tures as to dark Ahab s pre-cise agen-cy in the mat-ter from the be-gin-ning For me I silent-ly re-called the mys-te-ri-ous shad-ows I had seen creep-ing on board the Pe-quod dur-ing the dim Nan-tuck-et dawn as well as the enig-mat-i-cal hint-ings of the un-ac-count-able Eli-jah Mean-time Ahab out of hear-ing of his of-fi-cers hav-ing sid-ed the fur-thest to wind-ward was still rang-ing ahead of the oth-er boats a cir-cum-stance be-speak-ing how po-tent a crew was pulling him Those tiger yel-low crea-tures of his seemed all steel and whale-bone like five trip ham-mers they rose and fell with reg-u-lar strokes of strength which pe-ri-od-i-cal-ly start-ed the boat along the wa-ter like a hor-i-zon-tal burst boil-er out of a Mis-sis-sip-pi steam-er As for Fedal-lah who was seen pulling the har-pooneer oar he had thrown aside his black jack-et and dis-played his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the gun-wale clear-ly cut again-st the al-ter-nat-ing de-pres-sions of the wa-tery hori-zon while at the oth-er end of the boat Ahab with one arm like a fencer s thrown half back-ward in-to the air as if to coun-ter-bal-ance any ten-den-cy to trip Ahab was seen steadi-ly man-ag-ing his steer-ing oar as in a thou-sand boat low-er-ings ere the White Whale had torn him All at on-ce the out-stretched arm gave a pe-cu-liar mo-tion and then re-mained fixed while the boat s five oars were seen si-mul-ta-ne-ous-ly peaked Boat and crew sat mo-tion-less on the sea In-stant-ly the three spread boats in the rear paused on their way The whales had ir-reg-u-lar-ly set-tled bod-i-ly down in-to the blue thus giv-ing no dis-tant-ly dis-cernible to-ken of the move-ment though from his closer vicin-i-ty Ahab had ob-served it  Every man look out along his oars  cried Star-buck  Thou Quee-queg stand up  Nim-bly spring-ing up on the tri-an-gu-lar raised box in the bow the sav-age stood erect there and with in-tense-ly ea-ger eyes gazed off to-wards the spot where the chase had last been de-scried Like-wise up-on the ex-treme stern of the boat where it was al-so tri-an-gu-lar-ly plat-formed lev-el with the gun-wale Star-buck him-self was seen cool-ly and adroit-ly bal-anc-ing him-self to the jerk-ing toss-ings of his chip of a craft and silent-ly eye-ing the vast blue eye of the sea Not very far dis-tant Flask s boat was al-so ly-ing breath-less-ly still its com-man-der reck-less-ly stand-ing up-on the top of the log-ger-head a stout sort of post root-ed in the keel and ris-ing some two feet above the lev-el of the stern plat-form It is used for catch-ing turns with the whale line Its top is not more spa-cious than the palm of a man s hand and stand-ing up-on such a base as that Flask seemed perched at the mast head of some ship which had sunk to all but her trucks But lit-tle King Post was small and short and at the same time lit-tle King Post was full of a large and tall am-bi-tion so that this log-ger-head stand point of his did by no means sat-is-fy King Post  I can t see three seas off tip us up an oar there and let me on to that  Upon this Dag-goo with ei-ther hand up-on the gun-wale to steady his way swift-ly slid aft and then erect-ing him-self vol-un-teered his lofty shoul-ders for a pedestal  Good a mast head as any sir Will you mount   That I will and thank ye very much my fine fel-low on-ly I wish you fifty feet taller  Where-upon plant-ing his feet firm-ly again-st two op-po-site planks of the boat the gi-gan-tic ne-gro stoop-ing a lit-tle pre-sent-ed his flat palm to Flask s foot and then putting Flask s hand on his hearse plumed head and bid-ding him spring as he him-self should toss with one dex-ter-ous fling land-ed the lit-tle man high and dry on his shoul-ders And here was Flask now stand-ing Dag-goo with one lift-ed arm fur-nish-ing him with a breast-band to lean again-st and steady him-self by At any time it is a strange sight to the ty-ro to see with what won-drous habi-tude of un-con-scious skill the whale-man will main-tain an erect pos-ture in his boat even when pitched about by the most ri-otous-ly per-verse and cross run-ning seas Still more strange to see him gid-di-ly perched up-on the log-ger-head it-self un-der such cir-cum-stances But the sight of lit-tle Flask mount-ed up-on gi-gan-tic Dag-goo was yet more cu-ri-ous for sus-tain-ing him-self with a cool in-dif-fer-ent easy un-thought of bar-bar-ic majesty the no-ble ne-gro to ev-ery roll of the sea har-mo-nious-ly rolled his fine form On his broad back flax-en haired Flask seemed a snow flake The bearer looked no-bler than the rid-er Though tru-ly vi-va-cious tu-mul-tuous os-ten-ta-tious lit-tle Flask would now and then stamp with im-pa-tience but not one added heave did he there-by give to the ne-gro s lord-ly chest So have I seen Pas-sion and Van-i-ty stamp-ing the liv-ing mag-nan-i-mous earth but the earth did not al-ter her tides and her sea-sons for that Mean-while Stubb the third mate be-trayed no such far gaz-ing so-lic-i-tudes The whales might have made one of their reg-u-lar sound-ings not a tem-po-rary di-ve from mere fright and if that were the case Stubb as his wont in such cas-es it seems was re-solved to so-lace the lan-guish-ing in-ter-val with his pipe He with-drew it from his hat-band where he al-ways wore it aslant like a feath-er He load-ed it and rammed home the load-ing with his thumb end but hard-ly had he ig-nit-ed his match across the rough sand-pa-per of his hand when Tashte-go his har-pooneer whose eyes had been set-ting to wind-ward like two fixed stars sud-den-ly dropped like light from his erect at-ti-tude to his seat cry-ing out in a quick phren-sy of hur-ry  Down down all and give way  there they are  To a lands-man no whale nor any sign of a her-ring would have been vis-i-ble at that mo-ment noth-ing but a trou-bled bit of green-ish white wa-ter and thin scat-tered puffs of va-por hov-er-ing over it and suf-fus-ing-ly blow-ing off to lee-ward like the con-fused scud from white rolling bil-lows The air around sud-den-ly vi-brat-ed and tin-gled as it were like the air over in-tense-ly heat-ed plates of iron Be-neath this at-mo-spher-ic wav-ing and curling and par-tial-ly be-neath a thin lay-er of wa-ter al-so the whales were swim-ming Seen in ad-vance of all the oth-er in-di-ca-tions the puffs of va-por they spout-ed seemed their fore-run-ning couri-ers and de-tached fly-ing out-rid-ers All four boats were now in keen pur-suit of that one spot of trou-bled wa-ter and air But it bade fair to out-strip them it flew on and on as a mass of in-terblend-ing bub-bles borne down a rapid stream from the hills  Pull pull my good boys  said Star-buck in the low-est pos-si-ble but in-tens-est con-cen-trat-ed whis-per to his men while the sharp fixed glance from his eyes dart-ed straight ahead of the bow al-most seemed as two vis-i-ble needles in two unerring bin-na-cle com-pass-es He did not say much to his crew though nor did his crew say any-thing to him On-ly the si-lence of the boat was at in-ter-vals startling-ly pierced by one of his pe-cu-liar whis-pers now harsh with com-mand now soft with en-treaty How dif-fer-ent the loud lit-tle King Post  Sing out and say some-thing my hearties Roar and pull my thun-der-bolts Beach me beach me on their black backs boys on-ly do that for me and I ll sign over to you my Martha s Vine-yard plan-ta-tion boys in-clud-ing wife and chil-dren boys Lay me on lay me on O Lord Lord but I shall go stark star-ing mad See see that white wa-ter  And so shout-ing he pulled his hat from his head and stamped up and down on it then pick-ing it up flirt-ed it far off up-on the sea and fi-nal-ly fell to rear-ing and plung-ing in the boat s stern like a crazed colt from the prair-ie  Look at that chap now  philo-soph-i-cal-ly drawled Stubb who with his un-light-ed short pipe me-chan-i-cal-ly re-tained be-tween his teeth at a short dis-tance fol-lowed af-ter  He s got fits that Flask has Fits yes give him fit-s that s the very word pitch fits in-to  em Mer-ri-ly mer-ri-ly hearts alive Pud-ding for sup-per you know  mer-ry s the word Pull babes pull suck-lings pull all But what the dev-il are you hur-ry-ing about Soft-ly soft-ly and steadi-ly my men On-ly pull and keep pulling noth-ing more Crack all your back-bones and bite your knives in two that s all Take it easy why don t ye take it easy I say and burst all your liv-ers and lungs  But what it was that in-scrutable Ahab said to that tiger yel-low crew of his the-se were words best omit-ted here for you live un-der the blessed light of the evan-gel-i-cal land On-ly the in-fi-del sharks in the au-da-cious seas may give ear to such words when with tor-nado brow and eyes of red mur-der and foam glued lips Ahab leaped af-ter his prey Mean-while all the boats tore on The re-peat-ed speci-fic al-lu-sions of Flask to  that whale  as he called the fic-ti-tious mon-ster which he de-clared to be in-ces-sant-ly tan-ta-liz-ing his boat s bow with its tail the-se al-lu-sions of his were at times so vivid and life like that they would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fear-ful look over the shoul-der But this was again-st all rule for the oars-men must put out their eyes and ram a skew-er through their necks us-age pro-nounc-ing that they must have no or-gans but ears and no lim-bs but ar-ms in the-se crit-i-cal mo-men-ts It was a sight full of quick won-der and awe The vast swells of the om-nipo-tent sea the surg-ing hol-low roar they made as they rolled along the eight gun-wales like gi-gan-tic bowls in a bound-less bowl-ing green the brief sus-pend-ed agony of the boat as it would tip for an in-stant on the knife like edge of the sharper waves that al-most seemed threat-en-ing to cut it in two the sud-den pro-found dip in-to the wa-tery glens and hol-lows the keen spurrings and goad-ings to gain the top of the op-po-site hill the head-long sled like slide down its oth-er side  all the-se with the cries of the heads-men and har-pooneers and the shud-der-ing gasps of the oars-men with the won-drous sight of the ivory Pe-quod bear-ing down up-on her boats with out-stretched sails like a wild hen af-ter her scream-ing brood  all this was thrilling Not the raw re-cruit march-ing from the bo-som of his wife in-to the fever heat of his first bat-tle not the dead man s ghost en-coun-ter-ing the first un-known phan-tom in the oth-er world  nei-ther of the-se can feel stranger and stronger emo-tions than that man does who for the first time finds him-self pulling in-to the charmed churned cir-cle of the hunt-ed sperm whale The danc-ing white wa-ter made by the chase was now be-com-ing more and more vis-i-ble ow-ing to the in-creas-ing dark-ness of the dun cloud shad-ows flung up-on the sea The jets of va-por no longer blend-ed but tilt-ed ev-ery-where to right and left the whales seemed sep-a-rat-ing their wakes The boats were pulled more apart Star-buck giv-ing chase to three whales run-ning dead to lee-ward Our sail was now set and with the still ris-ing wind we rushed along the boat go-ing with such mad-ness through the wa-ter that the lee oars could scarce-ly be worked rapid-ly enough to es-cape be-ing torn from the row locks Soon we were run-ning through a suf-fus-ing wide veil of mist nei-ther ship nor boat to be seen  Give way men  whis-pered Star-buck draw-ing still fur-ther aft the sheet of his sail  there is time to kill a fish yet be-fore the squall comes There s white wa-ter again  close to Spring  Soon af-ter two cries in quick suc-ces-sion on each side of us de-not-ed that the oth-er boats had got fast but hard-ly were they over-heard when with a light-ning like hurtling whis-per Star-buck said  Stand up  and Quee-queg har-poon in hand sprang to his feet Though not one of the oars-men was then fac-ing the life and death per-il so close to them ahead yet with their eyes on the in-tense coun-te-nance of the mate in the stern of the boat they knew that the im-mi-nent in-stant had come they heard too an enor-mous wal-low-ing sound as of fifty ele-phan-ts stir-ring in their lit-ter Mean-while the boat was still boom-ing through the mist the waves curling and hiss-ing around us like the erect-ed crests of en-raged ser-pen-ts  That s his hump There there give it to him  whis-pered Star-buck A short rush-ing sound leaped out of the boat it was the dart-ed iron of Quee-queg Then all in one weld-ed com-mo-tion came an in-vis-i-ble push from astern while for-ward the boat seemed strik-ing on a ledge the sail col-lapsed and ex-plod-ed a gush of scald-ing va-por shot up near by some-thing rolled and tum-bled like an earth-quake be-neath us The whole crew were half suf-fo-cat-ed as they were tossed hel-ter skel-ter in-to the white cur-dling cream of the squall Squall whale and har-poon had all blend-ed to-geth-er and the whale mere-ly grazed by the iron es-caped Though com-plete-ly swamped the boat was near-ly un-harmed Swim-ming round it we picked up the float-ing oars and lash-ing them across the gun-wale tum-bled back to our places There we sat up to our knees in the sea the wa-ter cov-er-ing ev-ery rib and plank so that to our down-ward gaz-ing eyes the sus-pend-ed craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from the bot-tom of the ocean The wind in-creased to a howl the waves dashed their buck-lers to-geth-er the whole squall roared forked and crack-led around us like a white fire up-on the prair-ie in which un-con-sumed we were burn-ing im-mor-tal in the-se jaws of death In vain we hailed the oth-er boats as well roar to the live coals down the chim-ney of a flam-ing fur-nace as hail those boats in that storm Mean-while the driv-ing scud rack and mist grew dark-er with the shad-ows of night no sign of the ship could be seen The ris-ing sea for-bade all at-temp-ts to bale out the boat The oars were use-less as pro-pellers per-form-ing now the of-fice of life pre-servers So cut-ting the lash-ing of the wa-ter-proof match keg af-ter many fail-ures Star-buck con-trived to ig-nite the lamp in the lantern then stretch-ing it on a waif pole hand-ed it to Quee-queg as the stan-dard bearer of this for-lorn hope There then he sat hold-ing up that im-be-cile can-dle in the heart of that almighty for-lorn-ness There then he sat the sign and sym-bol of a man with-out faith hope-less-ly hold-ing up hope in the mid-st of de-spair Wet drenched through and shiv-er-ing cold de-spair-ing of ship or boat we lift-ed up our eyes as the dawn came on The mist still spread over the sea the emp-ty lantern lay crushed in the bot-tom of the boat Sud-den-ly Quee-queg start-ed to his feet hol-low-ing his hand to his ear We all heard a faint creak-ing as of ropes and yards hith-er-to muf-fled by the storm The sound came nearer and nearer the thick mis-ts were dim-ly part-ed by a huge vague form Af-fright-ed we all sprang in-to the sea as the ship at last loomed in-to view bear-ing right down up-on us with-in a dis-tance of not much more than its length Float-ing on the waves we saw the aban-doned boat as for one in-stant it tossed and gaped be-neath the ship s bows like a chip at the base of a cataract and then the vast hull rolled over it and it was seen no more till it came up wel-ter-ing astern Again we swam for it were dashed again-st it by the seas and were at last tak-en up and safe-ly land-ed on board Ere the squall came close to the oth-er boats had cut loose from their fish and re-turned to the ship in good time The ship had given us up but was still cruis-ing if hap-ly it might light up-on some to-ken of our per-ish-ing  an oar or a lance pole CHAPTER 49 The Hye-na There are cer-tain queer times and oc-ca-sions in this strange mixed af-fair we call life when a man takes this whole uni-verse for a vast prac-ti-cal joke though the wit there-of he but dim-ly dis-cerns and more than sus-pec-ts that the joke is at no-body s ex-pense but his own How-ev-er noth-ing dispir-its and noth-ing seems worth while dis-put-ing He bolts down all even-ts all creeds and be-liefs and per-sua-sions all hard things vis-i-ble and in-vis-i-ble nev-er mind how knob-by as an os-trich of po-tent di-ges-tion gob-bles down bul-lets and gun flints And as for small dif-fi-cul-ties and wor-ry-ings prospec-ts of sud-den dis-as-ter per-il of life and limb all the-se and death it-self seem to him on-ly sly good na-tured hits and jol-ly punch-es in the side be-stowed by the un-seen and un-ac-count-able old jok-er That odd sort of way-ward mood I am speak-ing of comes over a man on-ly in some time of ex-treme tribu-la-tion it comes in the very mid-st of his earnest-ness so that what just be-fore might have seemed to him a thing most mo-men-tous now seems but a part of the gen-er-al joke There is noth-ing like the per-ils of whal-ing to breed this free and easy sort of ge-nial des-per-ado phi-los-o-phy and with it I now re-gard-ed this whole voy-age of the Pe-quod and the great White Whale its ob-ject  Quee-queg  said I when they had dragged me the last man to the deck and I was still shak-ing my-self in my jack-et to fling off the wa-ter  Quee-queg my fine friend does this sort of thing of-ten hap-pen  Without much emo-tion though soaked through just like me he gave me to un-der-stand that such things did of-ten hap-pen  Mr Stubb  said I turn-ing to that wor-thy who but-toned up in his oil jack-et was now calm-ly smok-ing his pipe in the rain  Mr Stubb I think I have heard you say that of all whale-men you ev-er met our chief mate Mr Star-buck is by far the most care-ful and pru-dent I sup-pose then that go-ing plump on a fly-ing whale with your sail set in a fog-gy squall is the height of a whale-man s dis-cre-tion   Cer-tain I ve low-ered for whales from a leak-ing ship in a gale off Cape Horn   Mr Flask  said I turn-ing to lit-tle King Post who was stand-ing close by  you are ex-pe-ri-enced in the-se things and I am not Will you tell me whether it is an un-al-ter-able law in this fish-ery Mr Flask for an oars-man to break his own back pulling him-self back fore-most in-to death s jaws   Can t you twist that small-er  said Flask  Yes that s the law I should like to see a boat s crew back-ing wa-ter up to a whale face fore-most Ha ha the whale would give them squint for squint mind that  Here then from three im-par-tial wit-ness-es I had a de-lib-er-ate state-ment of the en-tire case Con-sid-er-ing there-fore that squalls and cap-siz-ings in the wa-ter and con-se-quent bivouacks on the deep were mat-ters of com-mon oc-cur-rence in this kind of life con-sid-er-ing that at the su-perla-tive-ly crit-i-cal in-stant of go-ing on to the whale I must re-sign my life in-to the hands of him who steered the boat of-ten-times a fel-low who at that very mo-ment is in his im-petu-ous-ness up-on the point of scut-tling the craft with his own fran-tic stamp-ings con-sid-er-ing that the par-tic-u-lar dis-as-ter to our own par-tic-u-lar boat was chiefly to be im-put-ed to Star-buck s driv-ing on to his whale al-most in the teeth of a squall and con-sid-er-ing that Star-buck notwith-stand-ing was fa-mous for his great heed-ful-ness in the fish-ery con-sid-er-ing that I be-longed to this un-com-mon-ly pru-dent Star-buck s boat and fi-nal-ly con-sid-er-ing in what a dev-il s chase I was im-pli-cat-ed touch-ing the White Whale tak-ing all things to-geth-er I say I thought I might as well go be-low and make a rough draft of my will  Quee-queg  said I  come along you shall be my lawyer ex-ecu-tor and lega-tee  It may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tin-ker-ing at their last wills and tes-ta-men-ts but there are no peo-ple in the world more fond of that di-ver-sion This was the fourth time in my nau-ti-cal life that I had done the same thing After the cer-e-mony was con-clud-ed up-on the pre-sent oc-ca-sion I felt all the eas-ier a stone was rolled away from my heart Be-sides all the days I should now live would be as good as the days that Lazarus lived af-ter his res-ur-rec-tion a sup-ple-men-tary clean gain of so many months or weeks as the case might be I sur-vived my-self my death and buri-al were locked up in my chest I looked round me tran-quil-ly and con-tent-ed-ly like a qui-et ghost with a clean con-science sit-ting in-side the bars of a snug fam-i-ly vault Now then thought I un-con-scious-ly rolling up the sleeves of my frock here goes for a cool col-lect-ed di-ve at death and de-struc-tion and the dev-il fetch the hind-most CHAPTER 5 Ahab s Boat and Crew Fedal-lah  Who would have thought it Flask  cried Stubb  if I had but one leg you would not catch me in a boat un-less may-be to stop the plug hole with my tim-ber toe Oh he s a won-der-ful old man   I don t think it so strange af-ter all on that ac-count  said Flask  If his leg were off at the hip now it would be a dif-fer-ent thing That would dis-able him but he has one knee and good part of the oth-er left you know   I don t know that my lit-tle man I nev-er yet saw him kneel  Among whale wise peo-ple it has of-ten been ar-gued whether con-sid-er-ing the paramount im-por-tance of his life to the suc-cess of the voy-age it is right for a whal-ing cap-tain to jeop-ar-dize that life in the ac-tive per-ils of the chase So Tamer-lane s sol-diers of-ten ar-gued with tears in their eyes whether that in-valu-able life of his ought to be car-ried in-to the thick-est of the fight But with Ahab the ques-tion as-sumed a mod-i-fied as-pect Con-sid-er-ing that with two legs man is but a hob-bling wight in all times of dan-ger con-sid-er-ing that the pur-suit of whales is al-ways un-der great and ex-traor-di-nary dif-fi-cul-ties that ev-ery in-di-vid-u-al mo-ment in-deed then com-pris-es a per-il un-der the-se cir-cum-stances is it wise for any maimed man to en-ter a whale boat in the hunt As a gen-er-al thing the joint own-ers of the Pe-quod must have plain-ly thought not Ahab well knew that al-though his friends at home would think lit-tle of his en-ter-ing a boat in cer-tain com-par-a-tive-ly harm-less vi-cis-si-tudes of the chase for the sake of be-ing near the scene of ac-tion and giv-ing his or-ders in per-son yet for Cap-tain Ahab to have a boat ac-tu-al-ly ap-por-tioned to him as a reg-u-lar heads-man in the hunt above all for Cap-tain Ahab to be sup-plied with five ex-tra men as that same boat s crew he well knew that such gen-er-ous con-ceits nev-er en-tered the heads of the own-ers of the Pe-quod There-fore he had not so-licit-ed a boat s crew from them nor had he in any way hint-ed his de-sires on that head Nev-er-the-less he had tak-en pri-vate mea-sures of his own touch-ing all that mat-ter Un-til Caba-co s pub-lished dis-cov-ery the sailors had lit-tle fore-seen it though to be sure when af-ter be-ing a lit-tle while out of port all hands had con-clud-ed the cus-tom-ary busi-ness of fit-ting the whale-boats for ser-vice when some time af-ter this Ahab was now and then found be-stir-ring him-self in the mat-ter of mak-ing thole pins with his own hands for what was thought to be one of the spare boats and even so-lic-i-tous-ly cut-ting the small wood-en skew-ers which when the line is run-ning out are pinned over the groove in the bow when all this was ob-served in him and par-tic-u-lar-ly his so-lic-i-tude in hav-ing an ex-tra coat of sheath-ing in the bot-tom of the boat as if to make it bet-ter with-stand the point-ed pres-sure of his ivory limb and al-so the anx-i-ety he evinced in ex-act-ly shap-ing the thigh board or clum-sy cleat as it is some-times called the hor-i-zon-tal piece in the boat s bow for brac-ing the knee again-st in dart-ing or stab-bing at the whale when it was ob-served how of-ten he stood up in that boat with his soli-tary knee fixed in the semi cir-cu-lar de-pres-sion in the cleat and with the car-pen-ter s chis-el gouged out a lit-tle here and straight-ened it a lit-tle there all the-se things I say had awak-ened much in-ter-est and cu-rios-i-ty at the time But al-most ev-ery-body sup-posed that this par-tic-u-lar prepar-a-tive heed-ful-ness in Ahab must on-ly be with a view to the ul-ti-mate chase of Moby Dick for he had al-ready re-vealed his in-ten-tion to hunt that mor-tal mon-ster in per-son But such a sup-po-si-tion did by no means in-volve the re-motest sus-pi-cion as to any boat s crew be-ing as-signed to that boat Now with the sub-or-di-nate phan-toms what won-der re-mained soon waned away for in a whaler won-ders soon wane Be-sides now and then such un-ac-count-able odds and ends of strange na-tions come up from the un-known nooks and ash holes of the earth to man the-se float-ing out-laws of whalers and the ships them-selves of-ten pick up such queer cast-away crea-tures found toss-ing about the open sea on planks bits of wreck oars whale-boats ca-noes blown off Ja-pane-se junks and what not that Beelze-bub him-self might climb up the side and step down in-to the cab-in to chat with the cap-tain and it would not cre-ate any un-sub-du-able ex-cite-ment in the fore-castle But be all this as it may cer-tain it is that while the sub-or-di-nate phan-toms soon found their place among the crew though still as it were some-how dis-tinct from them yet that hair tur-baned Fedal-lah re-mained a muf-fled mys-tery to the last Whence he came in a man-ner-ly world like this by what sort of un-ac-count-able tie he soon evinced him-self to be linked with Ahab s pe-cu-liar for-tunes nay so far as to have some sort of a half hint-ed in-flu-ence Heav-en knows but it might have been even au-thor-i-ty over him all this none knew But one can-not sus-tain an in-dif-fer-ent air con-cern-ing Fedal-lah He was such a crea-ture as civ-i-lized do-mes-tic peo-ple in the tem-per-ate zone on-ly see in their dreams and that but dim-ly but the like of whom now and then glide among the un-chang-ing Asi-at-ic com-mu-ni-ties es-pe-cial-ly the Ori-en-tal isles to the east of the con-ti-nen-t those in-su-lat-ed im-memo-ri-al un-al-ter-able coun-tries which even in the-se mod-ern days still pre-serve much of the ghost-ly abo-rig-i-nal-ness of earth s pri-mal gen-er-a-tions when the mem-o-ry of the first man was a dis-tinct rec-ol-lec-tion and all men his de-scen-dan-ts un-know-ing whence he came eyed each oth-er as re-al phan-toms and asked of the sun and the moon why they were cre-at-ed and to what end when though ac-cord-ing to Ge-n-e-sis the an-gels in-deed con-sort-ed with the daugh-ters of men the dev-ils al-so add the un-canon-i-cal Rab-bins in-dulged in mun-dane amours CHAPTER 51 The Spir-it Spout Days weeks passed and un-der easy sail the ivory Pe-quod had slow-ly swept across four sev-er-al cruis-ing grounds that off the Azores off the Cape de Verdes on the Plate so called be-ing off the mouth of the Rio de la Plata and the Car-rol Ground an un-staked wa-tery lo-cal-i-ty souther-ly from St He-le-na It was while glid-ing through the-se lat-ter wa-ters that one serene and moon-light night when all the waves rolled by like scrol-ls of sil-ver and by their soft suf-fus-ing seethings made what seemed a sil-very si-lence not a soli-tude on such a silent night a sil-very jet was seen far in ad-vance of the white bub-bles at the bow Lit up by the moon it looked ce-les-tial seemed some plumed and glit-ter-ing god up-ris-ing from the sea Fedal-lah first de-scried this jet For of the-se moon-light nights it was his wont to mount to the main mast head and stand a look out there with the same pre-ci-sion as if it had been day And yet though herds of whales were seen by night not one whale-man in a hun-dred would ven-ture a low-er-ing for them You may think with what emo-tions then the sea-men be-held this old Ori-en-tal perched aloft at such un-usu-al hours his tur-ban and the moon com-pan-ions in one sky But when af-ter spend-ing his uni-form in-ter-val there for sev-er-al suc-ces-sive nights with-out ut-ter-ing a sin-gle sound when af-ter all this si-lence his un-earth-ly voice was heard an-nounc-ing that sil-very moon lit jet ev-ery re-clin-ing mariner start-ed to his feet as if some winged spir-it had light-ed in the rig-ging and hailed the mor-tal crew  There she blows  Had the trump of judg-ment blown they could not have quiv-ered more yet still they felt no ter-ror rather plea-sure For though it was a most un-wont-ed hour yet so im-pres-sive was the cry and so deliri-ous-ly ex-cit-ing that al-most ev-ery soul on board in-stinc-tive-ly de-sired a low-er-ing Walk-ing the deck with quick side lung-ing strides Ahab com-mand-ed the t gal-lant sails and roy-als to be set and ev-ery stun-sail spread The best man in the ship must take the helm Then with ev-ery mast head manned the piled up craft rolled down be-fore the wind The strange up-heav-ing lift-ing ten-den-cy of the taffrail breeze fill-ing the hol-lows of so many sails made the buoy-ant hov-er-ing deck to feel like air be-neath the feet while still she rushed along as if two an-tag-o-nis-tic in-flu-ences were strug-gling in her one to mount di-rect to heav-en the oth-er to drive yaw-ing-ly to some hor-i-zon-tal goal And had you watched Ahab s face that night you would have thought that in him al-so two dif-fer-ent things were war-ring While his one live leg made live-ly echoes along the deck ev-ery stroke of his dead limb sound-ed like a coffin tap On life and death this old man walked But though the ship so swift-ly sped and though from ev-ery eye like ar-rows the ea-ger glances shot yet the sil-very jet was no more seen that night Every sailor swore he saw it on-ce but not a sec-ond time This mid-night spout had al-most grown a for-got-ten thing when some days af-ter lo at the same silent hour it was again an-nounced again it was de-scried by all but up-on mak-ing sail to over-take it on-ce more it dis-ap-peared as if it had nev-er been And so it served us night af-ter night till no one heed-ed it but to won-der at it Mys-te-ri-ous-ly jet-ted in-to the clear moon-light or starlight as the case might be dis-ap-pear-ing again for one whole day or two days or three and some-how seem-ing at ev-ery dis-tinct rep-e-ti-tion to be ad-vanc-ing still fur-ther and fur-ther in our van this soli-tary jet seemed for ev-er al-lur-ing us on Nor with the im-memo-ri-al su-per-sti-tion of their race and in ac-cor-dance with the preter-nat-u-ral-ness as it seemed which in many things in-vest-ed the Pe-quod were there want-ing some of the sea-men who swore that when-ev-er and wherever de-scried at how-ev-er re-mote times or in how-ev-er far apart lat-i-tudes and lon-gi-tudes that un-n-ear-able spout was cast by one self same whale and that whale Moby Dick For a time there reigned too a sense of pe-cu-liar dread at this flit-ting ap-pari-tion as if it were treach-er-ous-ly beck-on-ing us on and on in or-der that the mon-ster might turn round up-on us and rend us at last in the re-motest and most sav-age seas Th-e-se tem-po-rary ap-pre-hen-sions so vague but so aw-ful de-rived a won-drous po-ten-cy from the con-trast-ing seren-i-ty of the weath-er in which be-neath all its blue bland-ness some thought there lurked a dev-il-ish charm as for days and days we voy-aged along through seas so weari-ly lone-some-ly mild that all space in re-pug-nance to our venge-ful er-rand seemed va-cat-ing it-self of life be-fore our urn like prow But at last when turn-ing to the east-ward the Cape winds be-gan howl-ing around us and we rose and fell up-on the long trou-bled seas that are there when the ivory tusked Pe-quod sharply bowed to the blast and gored the dark waves in her mad-ness till like show-ers of sil-ver chips the foam flakes flew over her bul-warks then all this des-o-late vacu-ity of life went away but gave place to sights more dis-mal than be-fore Close to our bows strange for-ms in the wa-ter dart-ed hith-er and thith-er be-fore us while thick in our rear flew the in-scrutable sea ravens And ev-ery morn-ing perched on our stays rows of the-se birds were seen and spite of our hoot-ings for a long time ob-sti-nate-ly clung to the hemp as though they deemed our ship some drift-ing un-in-hab-it-ed craft a thing ap-point-ed to des-o-la-tion and there-fore fit roost-ing place for their home-less selves And heaved and heaved still un-rest-ing-ly heaved the black sea as if its vast tides were a con-science and the great mun-dane soul were in an-guish and re-morse for the long sin and suf-fer-ing it had bred Cape of Good Hope do they call ye Rather Cape Tor-men-toso as called of yore for long al-lured by the per-fid-i-ous si-lences that be-fore had at-tend-ed us we found our-selves launched in-to this tor-ment-ed sea where guilty be-ings trans-formed in-to those fowls and the-se fish seemed con-demned to swim on ev-er-last-ing-ly with-out any haven in store or beat that black air with-out any hori-zon But calm snow white and un-vary-ing still di-rect-ing its foun-tain of feath-ers to the sky still beck-on-ing us on from be-fore the soli-tary jet would at times be de-scried Dur-ing all this black-ness of the el-e-men-ts Ahab though as-sum-ing for the time the al-most con-tin-u-al com-mand of the drenched and dan-ger-ous deck man-i-fest-ed the gloomi-est re-serve and more sel-dom than ev-er ad-dressed his mates In tem-pes-tu-ous times like the-se af-ter ev-ery-thing above and aloft has been se-cured noth-ing more can be done but pas-sive-ly to await the is-sue of the gale Then Cap-tain and crew be-come prac-ti-cal fa-tal-ists So with his ivory leg in-sert-ed in-to its ac-cus-tomed hole and with one hand firm-ly grasp-ing a shroud Ahab for hours and hours would stand gaz-ing dead to wind-ward while an oc-ca-sion-al squall of sleet or snow would all but con-geal his very eye-lash-es to-geth-er Mean-time the crew driven from the for-ward part of the ship by the per-ilous seas that burst-ing-ly broke over its bows stood in a line along the bul-warks in the waist and the bet-ter to guard again-st the leap-ing waves each man had slipped him-self in-to a sort of bow-line se-cured to the rail in which he swung as in a loos-ened belt Few or no words were spo-ken and the silent ship as if manned by paint-ed sailors in wax day af-ter day tore on through all the swift mad-ness and glad-ness of the de-mo-ni-ac waves By night the same mute-ness of hu-man-i-ty be-fore the shrieks of the ocean pre-vailed still in si-lence the men swung in the bow-li-nes still word-less Ahab stood up to the blast Even when wea-ried na-ture seemed de-mand-ing re-pose he would not seek that re-pose in his ham-mock Nev-er could Star-buck for-get the old man s as-pect when one night go-ing down in-to the cab-in to mark how the barom-e-ter stood he saw him with closed eyes sit-ting straight in his floor screwed chair the rain and half melt-ed sleet of the storm from which he had some time be-fore emerged still slow-ly drip-ping from the un-re-moved hat and coat On the table beside him lay un-rolled one of those charts of tides and cur-ren-ts which have pre-vi-ous-ly been spo-ken of His lantern swung from his tight-ly clenched hand Though the body was erect the head was thrown back so that the closed eyes were point-ed to-wards the needle of the tell tale that swung from a beam in the ceil-ing The cab-in com-pass is called the tell tale be-cause with-out go-ing to the com-pass at the helm the Cap-tain while be-low can in-form him-self of the course of the ship Ter-ri-ble old man thought Star-buck with a shud-der sleep-ing in this gale still thou stead-fast-ly eye-st thy pur-pose CHAPTER 52 The Al-ba-tross South east-ward from the Cape off the dis-tant Crozetts a good cruis-ing ground for Right Whale-men a sail loomed ahead the Goney Al-ba-tross by name As she slow-ly drew nigh from my lofty per-ch at the fore mast head I had a good view of that sight so re-mark-able to a ty-ro in the far ocean fish-eries a whaler at sea and long ab-sent from home As if the waves had been fullers this craft was bleached like the skele-ton of a strand-ed wal-rus All down her sides this spec-tral ap-pear-ance was traced with long chan-nels of red-dened rust while all her spars and her rig-ging were like the thick branch-es of trees furred over with hoar frost On-ly her low-er sails were set A wild sight it was to see her long beard-ed look outs at those three mast heads They seemed clad in the skins of beasts so torn and bepatched the rai-ment that had sur-vived near-ly four years of cruis-ing Stand-ing in iron hoops nailed to the mast they swayed and swung over a fath-om-less sea and though when the ship slow-ly glid-ed close un-der our stern we six men in the air came so nigh to each oth-er that we might al-most have leaped from the mast heads of one ship to those of the oth-er yet those for-lorn look-ing fish-er-men mild-ly eye-ing us as they passed said not one word to our own look outs while the quar-ter deck hail was be-ing heard from be-low  Ship ahoy Have ye seen the White Whale  But as the strange cap-tain lean-ing over the pal-lid bul-warks was in the act of putting his trum-pet to his mouth it some-how fell from his hand in-to the sea and the wind now ris-ing amain he in vain stro-ve to make him-self heard with-out it Mean-time his ship was still in-creas-ing the dis-tance be-tween While in var-i-ous silent ways the sea-men of the Pe-quod were evinc-ing their ob-ser-vance of this omi-nous in-ci-dent at the first mere men-tion of the White Whale s name to an-oth-er ship Ahab for a mo-ment paused it al-most seemed as though he would have low-ered a boat to board the stranger had not the threat-en-ing wind for-bade But tak-ing ad-van-tage of his wind-ward po-si-tion he again seized his trum-pet and know-ing by her as-pect that the stranger ves-sel was a Nan-tuck-eter and short-ly bound home he loud-ly hailed  Ahoy there This is the Pe-quod bound round the world Tell them to ad-dress all fu-ture let-ters to the Paci-fic ocean and this time three years if I am not at home tell them to ad-dress them to    At that mo-ment the two wakes were fair-ly crossed and in-stant-ly then in ac-cor-dance with their sin-gu-lar ways shoals of small harm-less fish that for some days be-fore had been placid-ly swim-ming by our side dart-ed away with what seemed shud-der-ing fins and ranged them-selves fore and aft with the stranger s flanks Though in the course of his con-tin-u-al voy-ag-ings Ahab must of-ten be-fore have no-ticed a sim-i-lar sight yet to any mono-ma-ni-ac man the ver-i-est tri-fles capri-cious-ly car-ry mean-ings  Swim away from me do ye  mur-mured Ahab gaz-ing over in-to the wa-ter There seemed but lit-tle in the words but the tone con-veyed more of deep help-less sad-ness than the in-sane old man had ev-er be-fore evinced But turn-ing to the steers-man who thus far had been hold-ing the ship in the wind to di-min-ish her head-way he cried out in his old li-on voice   Up helm Keep her off round the world  Round the world There is much in that sound to in-spire proud feel-ings but where-to does all that cir-cum-nav-i-ga-tion con-duct On-ly through num-ber-less per-ils to the very point whence we start-ed where those that we left be-hind se-cure were all the time be-fore us Were this world an end-less plain and by sail-ing east-ward we could for ev-er reach new dis-tances and dis-cov-er sights more sweet and strange than any Cy-clades or Is-lands of King Solomon then there were promise in the voy-age But in pur-suit of those far mys-ter-ies we dream of or in tor-ment-ed chase of that de-mon phan-tom that some time or oth-er swims be-fore all hu-man hearts while chas-ing such over this round globe they ei-ther lead us on in bar-ren mazes or mid-way leave us whelmed CHAPTER 53 The Gam The os-ten-si-ble rea-son why Ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had spo-ken was this the wind and sea be-to-kened stor-ms But even had this not been the case he would not af-ter all per-haps have board-ed her judg-ing by his sub-se-quent con-duct on sim-i-lar oc-ca-sion-s if so it had been that by the pro-cess of hail-ing he had ob-tained a neg-a-tive an-swer to the ques-tion he put For as it even-tu-al-ly turned out he cared not to con-sort even for five min-utes with any stranger cap-tain ex-cept he could con-tribute some of that in-for-ma-tion he so ab-sorbing-ly sought But all this might re-main in-ad-e-quate-ly es-ti-mat-ed were not some-thing said here of the pe-cu-liar us-ages of whal-ing ves-sels when meet-ing each oth-er in for-eign seas and es-pe-cial-ly on a com-mon cruis-ing ground If two strangers cross-ing the Pine Bar-rens in New York State or the equal-ly des-o-late Sal-is-bury Plain in Eng-land if ca-su-al-ly en-coun-ter-ing each oth-er in such in-hos-pitable wilds the-se twain for the life of them can-not well avoid a mu-tu-al salu-ta-tion and stop-ping for a mo-ment to in-ter-change the news and per-haps sit-ting down for a while and rest-ing in con-cert then how much more nat-u-ral that up-on the il-lim-itable Pine Bar-rens and Sal-is-bury Plains of the sea two whal-ing ves-sels de-scry-ing each oth-er at the ends of the earth off lone Fan-ning s Is-land or the far away King s Mil-ls how much more nat-u-ral I say that un-der such cir-cum-stances the-se ships should not on-ly in-ter-change hails but come in-to still closer more friend-ly and so-cia-ble con-tact And es-pe-cial-ly would this seem to be a mat-ter of course in the case of ves-sels owned in one sea-port and whose cap-tains of-fi-cers and not a few of the men are per-son-al-ly known to each oth-er and con-se-quent-ly have all sorts of dear do-mes-tic things to talk about For the long ab-sent ship the out-ward bound-er per-haps has let-ters on board at any rate she will be sure to let her have some pa-pers of a date a year or two lat-er than the last one on her blurred and thumb worn files And in re-turn for that cour-tesy the out-ward bound ship would re-ceive the lat-est whal-ing in-tel-li-gence from the cruis-ing ground to which she may be des-tined a thing of the ut-most im-por-tance to her And in de-gree all this will hold true con-cern-ing whal-ing ves-sels cross-ing each oth-er s track on the cruis-ing ground it-self even though they are equal-ly long ab-sent from home For one of them may have re-ceived a trans-fer of let-ters from some third and now far re-mote ves-sel and some of those let-ters may be for the peo-ple of the ship she now meets Be-sides they would ex-change the whal-ing news and have an agree-able chat For not on-ly would they meet with all the sym-pa-thies of sailors but like-wise with all the pe-cu-liar con-ge-nial-i-ties aris-ing from a com-mon pur-suit and mu-tu-al-ly shared pri-va-tions and per-ils Nor would dif-fer-ence of coun-try make any very es-sen-tial dif-fer-ence that is so long as both par-ties speak one lan-guage as is the case with Amer-i-cans and English Though to be sure from the small num-ber of English whalers such meet-ings do not very of-ten oc-cur and when they do oc-cur there is too apt to be a sort of shy-ness be-tween them for your English-man is rather re-served and your Yan-kee he does not fan-cy that sort of thing in any-body but him-self Be-sides the English whalers some-times af-fect a kind of metropoli-tan su-pe-ri-or-i-ty over the Amer-i-can whalers re-gard-ing the long lean Nan-tuck-eter with his non-de-script provin-cialis-ms as a sort of sea peas-ant But where this su-pe-ri-or-i-ty in the English whale-men does re-al-ly con-sist it would be hard to say see-ing that the Yan-kees in one day col-lec-tive-ly kill more whales than all the English col-lec-tive-ly in ten years But this is a harm-less lit-tle foible in the English whale hunters which the Nan-tuck-eter does not take much to heart prob-a-bly be-cause he knows that he has a few foibles him-self So then we see that of all ships sep-a-rate-ly sail-ing the sea the whalers have most rea-son to be so-cia-ble and they are so Where-as some mer-chant ships cross-ing each oth-er s wake in the mid At-lantic will of-ten-times pass on with-out so much as a sin-gle word of recog-ni-tion mu-tu-al-ly cut-ting each oth-er on the high seas like a brace of dandies in Broad-way and all the time in-dulging per-haps in fini-cal crit-i-cism up-on each oth-er s rig As for Men of War when they chance to meet at sea they first go through such a string of sil-ly bow-ings and scrap-ings such a duck-ing of en-signs that there does not seem to be much right down hearty good will and broth-er-ly love about it at all As touch-ing Slave ships meet-ing why they are in such a prodi-gious hur-ry they run away from each oth-er as soon as pos-si-ble And as for Pi-rates when they chance to cross each oth-er s cross bones the first hail is  How many skul-ls   the same way that whalers hail  How many bar-rels  And that ques-tion on-ce an-swered pi-rates straight-way steer apart for they are in-fer-nal vil-lains on both sides and don t like to see over-much of each oth-er s vil-lanous like-ness-es But look at the god-ly hon-est un-os-ten-ta-tious hos-pitable so-cia-ble free and easy whaler What does the whaler do when she meets an-oth-er whaler in any sort of de-cent weath-er She has a  Gam  a thing so ut-ter-ly un-known to all oth-er ships that they nev-er heard of the name even and if by chance they should hear of it they on-ly grin at it and re-peat game-some stuff about  spouter-s and  blub-ber boil-ers  and such like pret-ty ex-cla-ma-tions Why it is that all Mer-chant sea-men and al-so all Pi-rates and Man of War s men and Slave ship sailors cher-ish such a scorn-ful feel-ing to-wards Whale ships this is a ques-tion it would be hard to an-swer Be-cause in the case of pi-rates say I should like to know whether that pro-fes-sion of theirs has any pe-cu-liar glo-ry about it It some-times ends in un-com-mon el-e-va-tion in-deed but on-ly at the gal-lows And be-sides when a man is el-e-vat-ed in that odd fash-ion he has no prop-er foun-da-tion for his su-pe-ri-or al-ti-tude Hence I con-clude that in boast-ing him-self to be high lift-ed above a whale-man in that as-ser-tion the pi-rate has no solid ba-sis to stand on But what is a Gam You might wear out your in-dex fin-ger run-ning up and down the colum-ns of dic-tio-nar-ies and nev-er find the word Dr John-son nev-er at-tained to that eru-di-tion Noah Web-ster s ark does not hold it Nev-er-the-less this same ex-pres-sive word has now for many years been in con-stant use among some fif-teen thou-sand true born Yan-kees Cer-tain-ly it needs a def-i-ni-tion and should be in-cor-po-rat-ed in-to the Lex-i-con With that view let me learned-ly de-fine it GAM NOUN A so-cial meet-ing of two or more Whale-ships gen-er-al-ly on a cruis-ing ground when af-ter ex-chang-ing hails they ex-change vis-its by boat-s crews the two cap-tains re-main-ing for the time on board of one ship and the two chief mates on the oth-er There is an-oth-er lit-tle item about Gam-ming which must not be for-got-ten here All pro-fes-sions have their own lit-tle pe-cu-liar-i-ties of de-tail so has the whale fish-ery In a pi-rate man of war or slave ship when the cap-tain is rowed any-where in his boat he al-ways sits in the stern sheets on a com-fort-able some-times cush-ioned seat there and of-ten steers him-self with a pret-ty lit-tle milliner s tiller dec-o-rat-ed with gay cords and rib-bons But the whale boat has no seat astern no so-fa of that sort what-ev-er and no tiller at all High times in-deed if whal-ing cap-tains were wheeled about the wa-ter on cas-tors like gouty old al-der-men in patent chairs And as for a tiller the whale boat nev-er ad-mits of any such ef-fem-i-na-cy and there-fore as in gam-ming a com-plete boat s crew must leave the ship and hence as the boat steerer or har-pooneer is of the num-ber that sub-or-di-nate is the steers-man up-on the oc-ca-sion and the cap-tain hav-ing no place to sit in is pulled off to his vis-it all stand-ing like a pine tree And of-ten you will no-tice that be-ing con-scious of the eyes of the whole vis-i-ble world rest-ing on him from the sides of the two ships this stand-ing cap-tain is all alive to the im-por-tance of sus-tain-ing his dig-ni-ty by main-tain-ing his legs Nor is this any very easy mat-ter for in his rear is the im-mense pro-ject-ing steer-ing oar hit-ting him now and then in the small of his back the af-ter oar re-cip-ro-cat-ing by rap-ping his knees in front He is thus com-plete-ly wedged be-fore and be-hind and can on-ly ex-pand him-self side-ways by set-tling down on his stretched legs but a sud-den vi-o-lent pitch of the boat will of-ten go far to top-ple him be-cause length of foun-da-tion is noth-ing with-out cor-re-spond-ing breadth Mere-ly make a spread an-gle of two poles and you can-not stand them up Then again it would nev-er do in plain sight of the world s riv-et-ed eyes it would nev-er do I say for this strad-dling cap-tain to be seen steady-ing him-self the slight-est par-ti-cle by catch-ing hold of any-thing with his hands in-deed as to-ken of his en-tire buoy-ant self com-mand he gen-er-al-ly car-ries his hands in his trowser-s pock-ets but per-haps be-ing gen-er-al-ly very large heavy hands he car-ries them there for bal-last Nev-er-the-less there have oc-curred in-stances well au-then-ti-cat-ed ones too where the cap-tain has been known for an un-com-mon-ly crit-i-cal mo-ment or two in a sud-den squall say to seize hold of the near-est oars-man s hair and hold on there like grim death CHAPTER 54 The Town Ho s Sto-ry As told at the Gold-en Inn The Cape of Good Hope and all the wa-tery re-gion round about there is much like some not-ed four cor-ners of a great high-way where you meet more trav-ellers than in any oth-er part It was not very long af-ter speak-ing the Goney that an-oth-er home-ward bound whale-man the Town Ho was en-coun-tered She was manned al-most whol-ly by Poly-ne-sians In the short gam that en-sued she gave us strong news of Moby Dick To some the gen-er-al in-ter-est in the White Whale was now wild-ly height-ened by a cir-cum-stance of the Town Ho s sto-ry which seemed ob-scure-ly to in-volve with the whale a cer-tain won-drous in-vert-ed vis-i-ta-tion of one of those so called judg-men-ts of God which at times are said to over-take some men This lat-ter cir-cum-stance with its own par-tic-u-lar ac-com-pa-ni-men-ts form-ing what may be called the se-cret part of the tragedy about to be nar-rat-ed nev-er reached the ears of Cap-tain Ahab or his mates For that se-cret part of the sto-ry was un-known to the cap-tain of the Town Ho him-self It was the pri-vate prop-er-ty of three con-fed-er-ate white sea-men of that ship one of whom it seems com-mu-ni-cat-ed it to Tashte-go with Romish in-junc-tions of se-cre-cy but the fol-low-ing night Tashte-go ram-bled in his sleep and re-vealed so much of it in that way that when he was wak-ened he could not well with-hold the rest Nev-er-the-less so po-tent an in-flu-ence did this thing have on those sea-men in the Pe-quod who came to the full knowl-edge of it and by such a strange del-i-ca-cy to call it so were they gov-erned in this mat-ter that they kept the se-cret among them-selves so that it nev-er tran-spired abaft the Pe-quod s main mast In-ter-weav-ing in its prop-er place this dark-er thread with the sto-ry as pub-licly nar-rat-ed on the ship the whole of this strange af-fair I now pro-ceed to put on last-ing record The an-cient whale cry up-on first sight-ing a whale from the mast head still used by whale-men in hunt-ing the fa-mous Gal-li-pagos ter-rap-in For my hu-mor s sake I shall pre-serve the style in which I on-ce nar-rat-ed it at Li-ma to a loung-ing cir-cle of my Span-ish friends one sain-t s eve smok-ing up-on the thick gilt tiled pi-az-za of the Gold-en Inn Of those fine cav-a-liers the young Dons Pe-dro and Se-bas-tian were on the closer ter-ms with me and hence the in-ter-lud-ing ques-tions they oc-ca-sion-al-ly put and which are du-ly an-swered at the time  Some two years pri-or to my first learn-ing the even-ts which I am about re-hears-ing to you gen-tle-men the Town Ho Sperm Whaler of Nan-tuck-et was cruis-ing in your Paci-fic here not very many days sail east-ward from the eaves of this good Gold-en Inn She was some-where to the north-ward of the Line One morn-ing up-on han-dling the pumps ac-cord-ing to dai-ly us-age it was ob-served that she made more wa-ter in her hold than com-mon They sup-posed a sword fish had stabbed her gen-tle-men But the cap-tain hav-ing some un-usu-al rea-son for be-liev-ing that rare good luck await-ed him in those lat-i-tudes and there-fore be-ing very averse to quit them and the leak not be-ing then con-sid-ered at all dan-ger-ous though in-deed they could not find it af-ter search-ing the hold as low down as was pos-si-ble in rather heavy weath-er the ship still con-tin-ued her cruis-ings the mariners work-ing at the pumps at wide and easy in-ter-vals but no good luck came more days went by and not on-ly was the leak yet undis-cov-ered but it sen-si-bly in-creased So much so that now tak-ing some alarm the cap-tain mak-ing all sail stood away for the near-est har-bor among the is-lands there to have his hull hove out and re-paired  Though no small pas-sage was be-fore her yet if the com-mon-est chance favoured he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the way be-cause his pumps were of the best and be-ing pe-ri-od-i-cal-ly re-lieved at them those six and thir-ty men of his could eas-i-ly keep the ship free nev-er mind if the leak should dou-ble on her In truth well nigh the whole of this pas-sage be-ing at-tend-ed by very pros-per-ous breezes the Town Ho had all but cer-tain-ly ar-rived in per-fect safe-ty at her port with-out the oc-cur-rence of the least fa-tal-i-ty had it not been for the bru-tal over-bear-ing of Rad-ney the mate a Vine-yarder and the bit-ter-ly pro-voked vengeance of Steelk-ilt a Lake-man and des-per-ado from Buf-falo   Lake-man  Buf-falo Pray what is a Lake-man and where is Buf-falo  said Don Se-bas-tian ris-ing in his swing-ing mat of grass  On the east-ern shore of our Lake Erie Don but I crave your cour-tesy may be you shall soon hear fur-ther of all that Now gen-tle-men in square sail brigs and three mast-ed ships well nigh as large and stout as any that ev-er sailed out of your old Cal-lao to far Manil-la this Lake-man in the land locked heart of our Amer-i-ca had yet been nur-tured by all those agrar-i-an free-boot-ing im-pres-sions pop-u-lar-ly con-nect-ed with the open ocean For in their in-ter-flow-ing ag-gre-gate those grand fresh wa-ter seas of ours  Erie and On-tar-io and Huron and Su-pe-ri-or and Michi-gan  pos-sess an ocean like ex-pan-sive-ness with many of the ocean s no-blest traits with many of its rimmed va-ri-eties of races and of climes They con-tain round archipela-goes of ro-man-tic isles even as the Poly-ne-sian wa-ters do in large part are shored by two great con-trast-ing na-tions as the At-lantic is they fur-nish long mar-itime ap-proach-es to our nu-mer-ous ter-ri-to-ri-al colonies from the East dot-ted all round their banks here and there are frowned up-on by bat-ter-ies and by the goat like crag-gy guns of lofty Mack-i-naw they have heard the fleet thun-der-ings of naval vic-to-ries at in-ter-vals they yield their beach-es to wild bar-bar-ians whose red paint-ed faces flash from out their pel-try wig-wams for leagues and leagues are flanked by an-cient and un-en-tered forests where the gaunt pines stand like ser-ried lines of kings in Goth-ic ge-nealo-gies those same woods har-bor-ing wild Afric beasts of prey and silken crea-tures whose ex-port-ed furs give robes to Tar-tar Em-per-ors they mir-ror the paved cap-i-tals of Buf-falo and Cleve-land as well as Win-nebago vil-lages they float alike the full rigged mer-chant ship the armed cruis-er of the State the steam-er and the beech ca-noe they are swept by Bore-an and dis-mast-ing blasts as dire-ful as any that lash the salt-ed wave they know what ship-wrecks are for out of sight of land how-ev-er in-land they have drowned full many a mid-night ship with all its shriek-ing crew Thus gen-tle-men though an in-lan-der Steelk-ilt was wild ocean born and wild ocean nur-tured as much of an au-da-cious mariner as any And for Rad-ney though in his in-fan-cy he may have laid him down on the lone Nan-tuck-et beach to nurse at his ma-ter-nal sea though in af-ter life he had long fol-lowed our aus-tere At-lantic and your con-tem-pla-tive Paci-fic yet was he quite as venge-ful and full of so-cial quar-rel as the back-woods sea-man fresh from the lat-i-tudes of buck horn han-dled Bow-ie knives Yet was this Nan-tuck-eter a man with some good heart-ed traits and this Lake-man a mariner who though a sort of dev-il in-deed might yet by in-flex-i-ble firm-ness on-ly tem-pered by that com-mon de-cen-cy of hu-man recog-ni-tion which is the meanest slave s right thus treat-ed this Steelk-ilt had long been re-tained harm-less and docile At all even-ts he had proved so thus far but Rad-ney was doomed and made mad and Steelk-ilt but gen-tle-men you shall hear  It was not more than a day or two at the fur-thest af-ter point-ing her prow for her is-land haven that the Town Ho s leak seemed again in-creas-ing but on-ly so as to re-quire an hour or more at the pumps ev-ery day You must know that in a set-tled and civ-i-lized ocean like our At-lantic for ex-am-ple some skip-pers think lit-tle of pump-ing their whole way across it though of a still sleepy night should the of-fi-cer of the deck hap-pen to for-get his du-ty in that re-spect the prob-a-bil-i-ty would be that he and his ship-mates would nev-er again re-mem-ber it on ac-count of all hands gen-tly sub-sid-ing to the bot-tom Nor in the soli-tary and sav-age seas far from you to the west-ward gen-tle-men is it al-to-geth-er un-usu-al for ships to keep clang-ing at their pump han-dles in full cho-rus even for a voy-age of con-sid-er-able length that is if it lie along a tol-er-a-bly ac-ces-si-ble coast or if any oth-er rea-son-able re-treat is af-ford-ed them It is on-ly when a leaky ves-sel is in some very out of the way part of those wa-ters some re-al-ly land-less lat-i-tude that her cap-tain be-gins to feel a lit-tle anx-ious  Much this way had it been with the Town Ho so when her leak was found gain-ing on-ce more there was in truth some small con-cern man-i-fest-ed by sev-er-al of her com-pa-ny es-pe-cial-ly by Rad-ney the mate He com-mand-ed the up-per sails to be well hoist-ed sheet-ed home anew and ev-ery way ex-pand-ed to the breeze Now this Rad-ney I sup-pose was as lit-tle of a cow-ard and as lit-tle in-clined to any sort of ner-vous ap-pre-hen-sive-ness touch-ing his own per-son as any fear-less un-think-ing crea-ture on land or on sea that you can con-ve-nient-ly imag-ine gen-tle-men There-fore when he be-trayed this so-lic-i-tude about the safe-ty of the ship some of the sea-men de-clared that it was on-ly on ac-count of his be-ing a part own-er in her So when they were work-ing that evening at the pumps there was on this head no small game-some-ness slily go-ing on among them as they stood with their feet con-tin-u-al-ly over-flowed by the rip-pling clear wa-ter clear as any moun-tain spring gen-tle-men that bub-bling from the pumps ran across the deck and poured it-self out in steady spouts at the lee scup-per holes  Now as you well know it is not sel-dom the case in this con-ven-tion-al world of ours wa-tery or oth-er-wise that when a per-son placed in com-mand over his fel-low men finds one of them to be very sig-nif-i-cant-ly his su-pe-ri-or in gen-er-al pride of man-hood straight-way again-st that man he con-ceives an un-con-quer-able dis-like and bit-ter-ness and if he have a chance he will pull down and pul-ver-ize that sub-al-tern s tow-er and make a lit-tle heap of dust of it Be this con-ceit of mine as it may gen-tle-men at all even-ts Steelk-ilt was a tall and no-ble an-i-mal with a head like a Ro-man and a flow-ing gold-en beard like the tas-seled hous-ings of your last viceroy s snort-ing charg-er and a brain and a heart and a soul in him gen-tle-men which had made Steelk-ilt Charle-mag-ne had he been born son to Charle-mag-ne s fa-ther But Rad-ney the mate was ug-ly as a mule yet as hardy as stub-born as ma-li-cious He did not love Steelk-ilt and Steelk-ilt knew it  Espy-ing the mate draw-ing near as he was toil-ing at the pump with the rest the Lake-man af-fect-ed not to no-tice him but un-awed went on with his gay ban-ter-ings   Aye aye my mer-ry lads it s a live-ly leak this hold a can-nikin one of ye and let s have a taste By the Lord it s worth bot-tling I tell ye what men old Rad s in-vest-ment must go for it he had best cut away his part of the hull and tow it home The fact is boys that sword fish on-ly be-gan the job he s come back again with a gang of ship car-pen-ters saw fish and file fish and what not and the whole pos-se of  em are now hard at work cut-ting and slash-ing at the bot-tom mak-ing im-prove-men-ts I sup-pose If old Rad were here now I d tell him to jump over-board and scat-ter  em They re play-ing the dev-il with his es-tate I can tell him But he s a sim-ple old soul  Rad and a beau-ty too Boys they say the rest of his prop-er-ty is in-vest-ed in look-ing glass-es I won-der if he d give a poor dev-il like me the mod-el of his nose    Damn your eyes what s that pump stop-ping for  roared Rad-ney pre-tend-ing not to have heard the sailors talk  Thun-der away at it    Aye aye sir  said Steelk-ilt mer-ry as a crick-et  Live-ly boys live-ly now  And with that the pump clanged like fifty fire en-gi-nes the men tossed their hats off to it and ere long that pe-cu-liar gasp-ing of the lungs was heard which de-notes the fullest ten-sion of life s ut-most en-ergies  Quit-ting the pump at last with the rest of his band the Lake-man went for-ward all pant-ing and sat him-self down on the wind-lass his face fiery red his eyes blood-shot and wip-ing the pro-fuse sweat from his brow Now what coz-en-ing fiend it was gen-tle-men that pos-sessed Rad-ney to med-dle with such a man in that cor-po-re-al-ly ex-as-per-at-ed state I know not but so it hap-pened In-tol-er-a-bly strid-ing along the deck the mate com-mand-ed him to get a broom and sweep down the planks and al-so a shov-el and re-move some of-fen-sive mat-ters con-se-quent up-on al-low-ing a pig to run at large  Now gen-tle-men sweep-ing a ship s deck at sea is a piece of house-hold work which in all times but rag-ing gales is reg-u-lar-ly at-tend-ed to ev-ery evening it has been known to be done in the case of ships ac-tu-al-ly founder-ing at the time Such gen-tle-men is the in-flex-i-bil-i-ty of sea us-ages and the in-stinc-tive love of neat-ness in sea-men some of whom would not will-ing-ly drown with-out first wash-ing their faces But in all ves-sels this broom busi-ness is the pre-scrip-tive province of the boys if boys there be aboard Be-sides it was the stronger men in the Town Ho that had been di-vid-ed in-to gangs tak-ing turns at the pumps and be-ing the most ath-let-ic sea-man of them all Steelk-ilt had been reg-u-lar-ly as-signed cap-tain of one of the gangs con-se-quent-ly he should have been freed from any triv-ial busi-ness not con-nect-ed with tru-ly nau-ti-cal du-ties such be-ing the case with his com-rades I men-tion all the-se par-tic-u-lars so that you may un-der-stand ex-act-ly how this af-fair stood be-tween the two men  But there was more than this the or-der about the shov-el was al-most as plain-ly meant to sting and in-sult Steelk-ilt as though Rad-ney had spat in his face Any man who has gone sailor in a whale ship will un-der-stand this and all this and doubtless much more the Lake-man ful-ly com-pre-hend-ed when the mate ut-tered his com-mand But as he sat still for a mo-ment and as he stead-fast-ly looked in-to the mate s ma-lig-nant eye and per-ceived the stacks of pow-der casks heaped up in him and the slow match silent-ly burn-ing along to-wards them as he in-stinc-tive-ly saw all this that strange for-bear-ance and un-will-ing-ness to stir up the deep-er pas-sion-ate-ness in any al-ready ire-ful be-ing a re-pug-nance most felt when felt at all by re-al-ly valiant men even when ag-grieved this name-less phan-tom feel-ing gen-tle-men stole over Steelk-ilt  There-fore in his or-di-nary tone on-ly a lit-tle bro-ken by the bod-i-ly ex-haus-tion he was tem-porar-i-ly in he an-swered him say-ing that sweep-ing the deck was not his busi-ness and he would not do it And then with-out at all al-lud-ing to the shov-el he point-ed to three lads as the cus-tom-ary sweep-ers who not be-ing bil-let-ed at the pumps had done lit-tle or noth-ing all day To this Rad-ney replied with an oath in a most dom-i-neer-ing and out-ra-geous man-ner un-con-di-tion-al-ly re-it-er-at-ing his com-mand mean-while ad-vanc-ing up-on the still seat-ed Lake-man with an up-lift-ed coop-er s club ham-mer which he had snatched from a cask near by  Heat-ed and ir-ri-tat-ed as he was by his spas-mod-ic toil at the pumps for all his first name-less feel-ing of for-bear-ance the sweat-ing Steelk-ilt could but ill brook this bear-ing in the mate but some-how still smoth-er-ing the con-fla-gra-tion with-in him with-out speak-ing he re-mained dogged-ly root-ed to his seat till at last the in-censed Rad-ney shook the ham-mer with-in a few inch-es of his face fu-ri-ous-ly com-mand-ing him to do his bid-ding  Steelk-ilt rose and slow-ly re-treat-ing round the wind-lass steadi-ly fol-lowed by the mate with his men-ac-ing ham-mer de-lib-er-ate-ly re-peat-ed his in-ten-tion not to obey See-ing how-ev-er that his for-bear-ance had not the slight-est ef-fect by an aw-ful and un-speak-able in-ti-ma-tion with his twist-ed hand he warned off the fool-ish and in-fat-u-at-ed man but it was to no pur-pose And in this way the two went on-ce slow-ly round the wind-lass when re-solved at last no longer to re-treat be-think-ing him that he had now for-borne as much as com-port-ed with his hu-mor the Lake-man paused on the hatch-es and thus spoke to the of-fi-cer   Mr Rad-ney I will not obey you Take that ham-mer away or look to your-self  But the pre-des-ti-nat-ed mate com-ing still closer to him where the Lake-man stood fixed now shook the heavy ham-mer with-in an inch of his teeth mean-while re-peat-ing a string of in-suf-fer-able male-dic-tions Re-treat-ing not the thou-sandth part of an inch stab-bing him in the eye with the un-flinch-ing poniard of his glance Steelk-ilt clench-ing his right hand be-hind him and creep-ing-ly draw-ing it back told his per-se-cu-tor that if the ham-mer but grazed his cheek he Steelk-ilt would mur-der him But gen-tle-men the fool had been brand-ed for the slaugh-ter by the gods Im-me-di-ate-ly the ham-mer touched the cheek the next in-stant the low-er jaw of the mate was stove in his head he fell on the hatch spout-ing blood like a whale  Ere the cry could go aft Steelk-ilt was shak-ing one of the back-stays lead-ing far aloft to where two of his com-rades were stand-ing their mast-heads They were both Canallers   Canallers  cried Don Pe-dro  We have seen many whale ships in our har-bours but nev-er heard of your Canallers Par-don who and what are they    Canallers Don are the boat-men be-long-ing to our grand Erie Canal You must have heard of it    Nay Senor here-abouts in this dull warm most lazy and hered-i-tary land we know but lit-tle of your vig-or-ous North    Aye Well then Don re-fill my cup Your chicha s very fine and ere pro-ceed-ing fur-ther I will tell ye what our Canallers are for such in-for-ma-tion may throw side light up-on my sto-ry   For three hun-dred and six-ty miles gen-tle-men through the en-tire breadth of the state of New York through nu-mer-ous pop-u-lous cities and most thriv-ing vil-lages through long dis-mal un-in-hab-it-ed swamps and af-flu-ent cul-ti-vat-ed fields un-ri-valled for fer-til-i-ty by bil-liard room and bar room through the holy of holies of great forests on Ro-man arch-es over In-di-an rivers through sun and shade by hap-py hearts or bro-ken through all the wide con-trast-ing scenery of those no-ble Mo-hawk coun-ties and es-pe-cial-ly by rows of snow white chapels whose spires stand al-most like mile-stones flows one con-tin-u-al stream of Vene-tian-ly cor-rupt and of-ten law-less life There s your true Ashantee gen-tle-men there howl your pa-gans where you ev-er find them next door to you un-der the long flung shad-ow and the snug pa-tro-n-is-ing lee of church-es For by some cu-ri-ous fa-tal-i-ty as it is of-ten not-ed of your metropoli-tan free-boot-ers that they ev-er en-camp around the hal-ls of jus-tice so sin-ners gen-tle-men most abound in holi-est vicini-ties   Is that a fri-ar pass-ing  said Don Pe-dro look-ing down-wards in-to the crowd-ed plaz-za with hu-mor-ous con-cern   Well for our north-ern friend Dame Is-abel-la s In-qui-si-tion wanes in Li-ma  laughed Don Se-bas-tian  Pro-ceed Senor    A mo-ment Par-don  cried an-oth-er of the com-pa-ny  In the name of all us Limeese I but de-sire to ex-press to you sir sailor that we have by no means over-looked your del-i-ca-cy in not sub-sti-tut-ing pre-sent Li-ma for dis-tant Venice in your cor-rupt com-par-ison Oh do not bow and look sur-prised you know the proverb all along this coast  Cor-rupt as Li-ma  It but bears out your say-ing too church-es more plen-ti-ful than bil-liard ta-bles and for ev-er open and  Cor-rupt as Li-ma  So too Venice I have been there the holy city of the blessed evan-ge-list St Mark  St Do-minic purge it Your cup Thanks here I re-fill now you pour out again   Freely de-pict-ed in his own vo-ca-tion gen-tle-men the Canaller would make a fine dra-mat-ic hero so abun-dant-ly and pic-turesque-ly wicked is he Like Mark Antony for days and days along his green turfed flow-ery Nile he in-do-lent-ly floats open-ly toy-ing with his red cheeked Cleopa-tra ripen-ing his apri-cot thigh up-on the sun-ny deck But ashore all this ef-fem-i-na-cy is dashed The brig-an-dish guise which the Canaller so proud-ly sports his slouched and gai-ly rib-boned hat be-to-ken his grand fea-tures A ter-ror to the smil-ing in-no-cence of the vil-lages through which he floats his swart vis-age and bold swag-ger are not un-shunned in cities Once a vagabond on his own canal I have re-ceived good turns from one of the-se Canallers I thank him hearti-ly would fain be not un-grate-ful but it is of-ten one of the prime re-deem-ing qual-i-ties of your man of vi-o-lence that at times he has as stiff an arm to back a poor stranger in a strait as to plun-der a wealthy one In sum gen-tle-men what the wild-ness of this canal life is is em-phat-i-cal-ly evinced by this that our wild whale fish-ery con-tains so many of its most fin-ished grad-u-ates and that scarce any race of mankind ex-cept Syd-ney men are so much dis-trust-ed by our whal-ing cap-tains Nor does it at all di-min-ish the cu-ri-ous-ness of this mat-ter that to many thou-sands of our ru-ral boys and young men born along its line the pro-ba-tion-ary life of the Grand Canal fur-nish-es the sole tran-si-tion be-tween qui-et-ly reap-ing in a Chris-tian corn field and reck-less-ly plough-ing the wa-ters of the most bar-bar-ic seas   I see I see  im-petu-ous-ly ex-claimed Don Pe-dro spilling his chicha up-on his sil-very ruf-fles  No need to trav-el The world s one Li-ma I had thought now that at your tem-per-ate North the gen-er-a-tions were cold and holy as the hills  But the sto-ry   I left off gen-tle-men where the Lake-man shook the back-stay Hard-ly had he done so when he was sur-round-ed by the three ju-nior mates and the four har-pooneers who all crowd-ed him to the deck But slid-ing down the ropes like bale-ful comets the two Canallers rushed in-to the up-roar and sought to drag their man out of it to-wards the fore-castle Others of the sailors joined with them in this at-tempt and a twist-ed tur-moil en-sued while stand-ing out of har-m s way the valiant cap-tain danced up and down with a whale pike call-ing up-on his of-fi-cers to man-han-dle that atro-cious scoundrel and smoke him along to the quar-ter deck At in-ter-vals he ran close up to the re-volv-ing bor-der of the con-fu-sion and pry-ing in-to the heart of it with his pike sought to prick out the ob-ject of his re-sent-ment But Steelk-ilt and his des-per-a-does were too much for them all they suc-ceed-ed in gain-ing the fore-castle deck where hasti-ly slew-ing about three or four large casks in a line with the wind-lass the-se sea Parisians en-trenched them-selves be-hind the bar-ri-cade   Come out of that ye pi-rates  roared the cap-tain now men-ac-ing them with a pis-tol in each hand just brought to him by the stew-ard  Come out of that ye cut throats   Steelk-ilt leaped on the bar-ri-cade and strid-ing up and down there de-fied the worst the pis-tols could do but gave the cap-tain to un-der-stand dis-tinct-ly that his Steelk-ilt s death would be the sig-nal for a mur-der-ous mutiny on the part of all hands Fear-ing in his heart lest this might prove but too true the cap-tain a lit-tle de-sist-ed but still com-mand-ed the in-sur-gen-ts in-stant-ly to re-turn to their du-ty   Will you promise not to touch us if we do  de-mand-ed their ringlead-er   Turn to turn to  I make no promise  to your du-ty Do you want to sink the ship by knock-ing off at a time like this Turn to  and he on-ce more raised a pis-tol   Sink the ship  cried Steelk-ilt  Aye let her sink Not a man of us turns to un-less you swear not to raise a rope yarn again-st us What say ye men  turn-ing to his com-rades A fierce cheer was their re-spon-se  The Lake-man now pa-trolled the bar-ri-cade all the while keep-ing his eye on the Cap-tain and jerk-ing out such sen-tences as the-se   It s not our fault we did-n t want it I told him to take his ham-mer away it was boy s busi-ness he might have known me be-fore this I told him not to prick the buf-falo I be-lieve I have bro-ken a fin-ger here again-st his cursed jaw ain t those minc-ing knives down in the fore-castle there men look to those hand-spikes my hearties Cap-tain by God look to your-self say the word don t be a fool for-get it all we are ready to turn to treat us de-cent-ly and we re your men but we won t be flogged    Turn to I make no promis-es turn to I say    Look ye now  cried the Lake-man fling-ing out his arm to-wards him  there are a few of us here and I am one of them who have shipped for the cruise d ye see now as you well know sir we can claim our dis-charge as soon as the an-chor is down so we don t want a row it s not our in-ter-est we want to be peace-able we are ready to work but we won t be flogged    Turn to  roared the Cap-tain  Steelk-ilt glanced round him a mo-ment and then said   I tell you what it is now Cap-tain rather than kill ye and be hung for such a shab-by ras-cal we won t lift a hand again-st ye un-less ye at-tack us but till you say the word about not flog-ging us we don t do a hand s turn    Down in-to the fore-castle then down with ye I ll keep ye there till ye re sick of it Down ye go    Shall we  cried the ringlead-er to his men Most of them were again-st it but at length in obe-di-ence to Steelk-ilt they pre-ced-ed him down in-to their dark den growl-ing-ly dis-ap-pear-ing like bears in-to a cave  As the Lake-man s bare head was just lev-el with the planks the Cap-tain and his pos-se leaped the bar-ri-cade and rapid-ly draw-ing over the slide of the scut-tle plant-ed their group of hands up-on it and loud-ly called for the stew-ard to bring the heavy brass pad-lock be-long-ing to the com-pan-ion-way Then open-ing the slide a lit-tle the Cap-tain whis-pered some-thing down the crack closed it and turned the key up-on them ten in num-ber leav-ing on deck some twen-ty or more who thus far had re-mained neu-tral  All night a wide awake watch was kept by all the of-fi-cers for-ward and aft es-pe-cial-ly about the fore-castle scut-tle and fore hatch-way at which last place it was feared the in-sur-gen-ts might emerge af-ter break-ing through the bulk-head be-low But the hours of dark-ness passed in peace the men who still re-mained at their du-ty toil-ing hard at the pumps whose clink-ing and clank-ing at in-ter-vals through the drea-ry night dis-mal-ly re-sound-ed through the ship  At sun-rise the Cap-tain went for-ward and knock-ing on the deck sum-moned the pris-on-ers to work but with a yell they re-fused Water was then low-ered down to them and a cou-ple of hand-fuls of bis-cuit were tossed af-ter it when again turn-ing the key up-on them and pock-et-ing it the Cap-tain re-turned to the quar-ter deck Twice ev-ery day for three days this was re-peat-ed but on the fourth morn-ing a con-fused wran-gling and then a scuf-fling was heard as the cus-tom-ary sum-mons was de-liv-ered and sud-den-ly four men burst up from the fore-castle say-ing they were ready to turn to The fetid close-ness of the air and a fam-ish-ing di-et unit-ed per-haps to some fears of ul-ti-mate re-tri-bu-tion had con-strained them to sur-ren-der at dis-cre-tion Em-bold-ened by this the Cap-tain re-it-er-at-ed his de-mand to the rest but Steelk-ilt shout-ed up to him a ter-ri-fic hint to stop his bab-bling and be-take him-self where he be-longed On the fifth morn-ing three oth-ers of the mu-ti-neers bolt-ed up in-to the air from the des-per-ate ar-ms be-low that sought to re-strain them On-ly three were left   Bet-ter turn to now  said the Cap-tain with a heart-less jeer   Shut us up again will ye  cried Steelk-ilt   Oh cer-tain-ly  said the Cap-tain and the key clicked  It was at this point gen-tle-men that en-raged by the de-fec-tion of sev-en of his for-mer as-so-ci-ates and stung by the mock-ing voice that had last hailed him and mad-dened by his long en-tomb-ment in a place as black as the bow-els of de-spair it was then that Steelk-ilt pro-posed to the two Canallers thus far ap-par-ent-ly of one mind with him to burst out of their hole at the next sum-mon-ing of the gar-rison and armed with their keen minc-ing knives long cres-cen-tic heavy im-ple-men-ts with a han-dle at each end run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail and if by any dev-il-ish-ness of des-per-a-tion pos-si-ble seize the ship For him-self he would do this he said whether they joined him or not That was the last night he should spend in that den But the scheme met with no op-po-si-tion on the part of the oth-er two they swore they were ready for that or for any oth-er mad thing for any-thing in short but a sur-ren-der And what was more they each in-sist-ed up-on be-ing the first man on deck when the time to make the rush should come But to this their lead-er as fierce-ly ob-ject-ed re-serv-ing that pri-or-i-ty for him-self par-tic-u-lar-ly as his two com-rades would not yield the one to the oth-er in the mat-ter and both of them could not be first for the lad-der would but ad-mit one man at a time And here gen-tle-men the foul play of the-se mis-cre-an-ts must come out  Upon hear-ing the fran-tic pro-ject of their lead-er each in his own sep-a-rate soul had sud-den-ly light-ed it would seem up-on the same piece of treach-ery name-ly to be fore-most in break-ing out in or-der to be the first of the three though the last of the ten to sur-ren-der and there-by se-cure what-ev-er small chance of par-don such con-duct might mer-it But when Steelk-ilt made known his de-ter-mi-na-tion still to lead them to the last they in some way by some sub-tle chem-istry of vil-lany mixed their be-fore se-cret treacheries to-geth-er and when their lead-er fell in-to a doze ver-bal-ly opened their souls to each oth-er in three sen-tences and bound the sleep-er with cords and gagged him with cords and shrieked out for the Cap-tain at mid-night  Think-ing mur-der at hand and smelling in the dark for the blood he and all his armed mates and har-pooneers rushed for the fore-castle In a few min-utes the scut-tle was opened and bound hand and foot the still strug-gling ringlead-er was shoved up in-to the air by his per-fid-i-ous al-lies who at on-ce claimed the hon-or of se-cur-ing a man who had been ful-ly ripe for mur-der But all the-se were col-lared and dragged along the deck like dead cat-tle and side by side were seized up in-to the mizzen rig-ging like three quar-ters of meat and there they hung till morn-ing  Damn ye  cried the Cap-tain pac-ing to and fro be-fore them  the vul-tures would not touch ye ye vil-lains   At sun-rise he sum-moned all hands and sep-a-rat-ing those who had re-belled from those who had tak-en no part in the mutiny he told the for-mer that he had a good mind to flog them all round thought up-on the whole he would do so he ought to jus-tice de-mand-ed it but for the pre-sent con-sid-er-ing their time-ly sur-ren-der he would let them go with a rep-ri-mand which he ac-cord-ing-ly ad-min-is-tered in the ver-nac-u-lar   But as for you ye car-rion rogues  turn-ing to the three men in the rig-ging  for you I mean to mince ye up for the try pots  and seiz-ing a rope he ap-plied it with all his might to the backs of the two traitors till they yelled no more but life-less-ly hung their heads side-ways as the two cru-ci-fied thieves are drawn   My wrist is sprained with ye  he cried at last  but there is still rope enough left for you my fine ban-tam that would-n t give up Take that gag from his mouth and let us hear what he can say for him-self   For a mo-ment the ex-haust-ed mu-ti-neer made a tremu-lous mo-tion of his cramped jaws and then painful-ly twist-ing round his head said in a sort of hiss  What I say is this and mind it well if you flog me I mur-der you    Say ye so then see how ye fright-en me  and the Cap-tain drew off with the rope to strike   Best not  hissed the Lake-man   But I must   and the rope was on-ce more drawn back for the stroke  Steelk-ilt here hissed out some-thing in-audi-ble to all but the Cap-tain who to the amaze-ment of all hands start-ed back paced the deck rapid-ly two or three times and then sud-den-ly throw-ing down his rope said  I won t do it let him go cut him down d ye hear   But as the ju-nior mates were hur-ry-ing to ex-e-cute the or-der a pale man with a ban-daged head ar-rest-ed them Rad-ney the chief mate Ever since the blow he had lain in his berth but that morn-ing hear-ing the tu-mult on the deck he had crept out and thus far had watched the whole scene Such was the state of his mouth that he could hard-ly speak but mum-bling some-thing about his be-ing will-ing and able to do what the cap-tain dared not at-tempt he snatched the rope and ad-vanced to his pin-ioned foe   You are a cow-ard  hissed the Lake-man   So I am but take that  The mate was in the very act of strik-ing when an-oth-er hiss stayed his up-lift-ed arm He paused and then paus-ing no more made good his word spite of Steelk-ilt s threat what-ev-er that might have been The three men were then cut down all hands were turned to and sul-len-ly worked by the moody sea-men the iron pumps clanged as be-fore  Just af-ter dark that day when one watch had re-tired be-low a clam-or was heard in the fore-castle and the two trem-bling traitors run-ning up be-sieged the cab-in door say-ing they durst not con-sort with the crew En-treaties cuffs and kicks could not drive them back so at their own in-stance they were put down in the ship s run for sal-va-tion Still no sign of mutiny reap-peared among the rest On the con-trary it seemed that main-ly at Steelk-ilt s in-sti-ga-tion they had re-solved to main-tain the strictest peace-ful-ness obey all or-ders to the last and when the ship reached port de-sert her in a body But in or-der to in-sure the speed-i-est end to the voy-age they all agreed to an-oth-er thing name-ly not to sing out for whales in case any should be dis-cov-ered For spite of her leak and spite of all her oth-er per-ils the Town Ho still main-tained her mast heads and her cap-tain was just as will-ing to low-er for a fish that mo-ment as on the day his craft first struck the cruis-ing ground and Rad-ney the mate was quite as ready to change his berth for a boat and with his ban-daged mouth seek to gag in death the vi-tal jaw of the whale  But though the Lake-man had in-duced the sea-men to adopt this sort of pas-sive-ness in their con-duct he kept his own coun-sel at least till all was over con-cern-ing his own prop-er and pri-vate re-venge up-on the man who had stung him in the ven-tri-cles of his heart He was in Rad-ney the chief mate s watch and as if the in-fat-u-at-ed man sought to run more than half way to meet his doom af-ter the scene at the rig-ging he in-sist-ed again-st the ex-press coun-sel of the cap-tain up-on re-sum-ing the head of his watch at night Upon this and one or two oth-er cir-cum-stances Steelk-ilt sys-tem-at-i-cal-ly built the plan of his re-venge  Dur-ing the night Rad-ney had an un-sea-man-like way of sit-ting on the bul-warks of the quar-ter deck and lean-ing his arm up-on the gun-wale of the boat which was hoist-ed up there a lit-tle above the ship s side In this at-ti-tude it was well known he some-times dozed There was a con-sid-er-able va-can-cy be-tween the boat and the ship and down be-tween this was the sea Steelk-ilt cal-cu-lat-ed his time and found that his next trick at the helm would come round at two o clock in the morn-ing of the third day from that in which he had been be-trayed At his leisure he em-ployed the in-ter-val in braid-ing some-thing very care-ful-ly in his watch-es be-low   What are you mak-ing there  said a ship-mate   What do you think what does it look like    Like a lan-yard for your bag but it s an odd one seems to me    Yes rather odd-ish  said the Lake-man hold-ing it at ar-m s length be-fore him  but I think it will an-swer Ship-mate I haven t enough twine  have you any   But there was none in the fore-castle   Then I must get some from old Rad  and he rose to go aft   You don t mean to go a beg-ging to him  said a sailor   Why not Do you think he won t do me a turn when it s to help him-self in the end ship-mate  and go-ing to the mate he looked at him qui-et-ly and asked him for some twine to mend his ham-mock It was given him nei-ther twine nor lan-yard were seen again but the next night an iron ball close-ly net-ted part-ly rolled from the pock-et of the Lake-man s mon-key jack-et as he was tuck-ing the coat in-to his ham-mock for a pil-low Twen-ty four hours af-ter his trick at the silent helm nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave al-ways ready dug to the sea-man s hand that fa-tal hour was then to come and in the fore or-dain-ing soul of Steelk-ilt the mate was al-ready stark and stretched as a corpse with his fore-head crushed in  But gen-tle-men a fool saved the would be mur-derer from the bloody deed he had planned Yet com-plete re-venge he had and with-out be-ing the avenger For by a mys-te-ri-ous fa-tal-i-ty Heav-en it-self seemed to step in to take out of his hands in-to its own the damn-ing thing he would have done  It was just be-tween day-break and sun-rise of the morn-ing of the sec-ond day when they were wash-ing down the decks that a stupid Tener-if-fe man draw-ing wa-ter in the main chains all at on-ce shout-ed out  There she rol-ls there she rol-ls  Je-su what a whale It was Moby Dick   Moby Dick  cried Don Se-bas-tian  St Do-minic Sir sailor but do whales have chris-ten-ings Whom call you Moby Dick    A very white and fa-mous and most dead-ly im-mor-tal mon-ster Don  but that would be too long a sto-ry    How how  cried all the young Spa-niards crowd-ing   Nay Dons Don-s nay nay I can-not re-hearse that now Let me get more in-to the air Sirs    The chicha the chicha  cried Don Pe-dro  our vig-or-ous friend looks faint  fill up his emp-ty glass   No need gen-tle-men one mo-ment and I pro-ceed  Now gen-tle-men so sud-den-ly per-ceiv-ing the snowy whale with-in fifty yards of the ship for-get-ful of the com-pact among the crew in the ex-cite-ment of the mo-ment the Tener-if-fe man had in-stinc-tive-ly and in-vol-un-tar-i-ly lift-ed his voice for the mon-ster though for some lit-tle time past it had been plain-ly be-held from the three sul-len mast heads All was now a phren-sy  The White Whale the White Whale  was the cry from cap-tain mates and har-pooneers who un-de-terred by fear-ful ru-mours were all anx-ious to cap-ture so fa-mous and pre-cious a fish while the dogged crew eyed askance and with curs-es the ap-palling beau-ty of the vast milky mass that lit up by a hor-i-zon-tal span-gling sun shift-ed and glis-tened like a liv-ing opal in the blue morn-ing sea Gentle-men a strange fa-tal-i-ty per-vades the whole ca-reer of the-se even-ts as if ver-i-ly mapped out be-fore the world it-self was chart-ed The mu-ti-neer was the bows-man of the mate and when fast to a fish it was his du-ty to sit next him while Rad-ney stood up with his lance in the prow and haul in or slack-en the line at the word of com-mand More-over when the four boats were low-ered the mate s got the start and none howled more fierce-ly with de-light than did Steelk-ilt as he strained at his oar After a stiff pull their har-pooneer got fast and spear in hand Rad-ney sprang to the bow He was al-ways a fu-ri-ous man it seems in a boat And now his ban-daged cry was to beach him on the whale s top-most back Noth-ing loath his bows-man hauled him up and up through a blind-ing foam that blent two white-ness-es to-geth-er till of a sud-den the boat struck as again-st a sunken ledge and keel-ing over spilled out the stand-ing mate That in-stant as he fell on the whale s slip-pery back the boat right-ed and was dashed aside by the swell while Rad-ney was tossed over in-to the sea on the oth-er flank of the whale He struck out through the spray and for an in-stant was dim-ly seen through that veil wild-ly seek-ing to re-move him-self from the eye of Moby Dick But the whale rushed round in a sud-den mael-strom seized the swim-mer be-tween his jaws and rear-ing high up with him plunged head-long again and went down  Mean-time at the first tap of the boat s bot-tom the Lake-man had slack-ened the line so as to drop astern from the whirlpool calm-ly look-ing on he thought his own thoughts But a sud-den ter-ri-fic down-ward jerk-ing of the boat quick-ly brought his knife to the line He cut it and the whale was free But at some dis-tance Moby Dick rose again with some tat-ters of Rad-ney s red wool-len shirt caught in the teeth that had de-stroyed him All four boats gave chase again but the whale elud-ed them and fi-nal-ly whol-ly dis-ap-peared  In good time the Town Ho reached her port a sav-age soli-tary place where no civ-i-lized crea-ture resid-ed There head-ed by the Lake-man all but five or six of the fore-mast-men de-lib-er-ate-ly de-sert-ed among the palms even-tu-al-ly as it turned out seiz-ing a large dou-ble war ca-noe of the sav-ages and set-ting sail for some oth-er har-bor  The ship s com-pa-ny be-ing re-duced to but a hand-ful the cap-tain called up-on the Is-lan-ders to as-sist him in the la-bo-ri-ous busi-ness of heav-ing down the ship to stop the leak But to such un-rest-ing vig-i-lance over their dan-ger-ous al-lies was this small band of whites ne-ces-si-tat-ed both by night and by day and so ex-treme was the hard work they un-der-went that up-on the ves-sel be-ing ready again for sea they were in such a weak-ened con-di-tion that the cap-tain durst not put off with them in so heavy a ves-sel After tak-ing coun-sel with his of-fi-cers he an-chored the ship as far off shore as pos-si-ble load-ed and ran out his two can-non from the bows stacked his mus-kets on the poop and warn-ing the Is-lan-ders not to ap-proach the ship at their per-il took one man with him and set-ting the sail of his best whale boat steered straight be-fore the wind for Tahi-ti five hun-dred miles dis-tant to pro-cure a re-in-force-ment to his crew  On the fourth day of the sail a large ca-noe was de-scried which seemed to have touched at a low isle of corals He steered away from it but the sav-age craft bore down on him and soon the voice of Steelk-ilt hailed him to heave to or he would run him un-der wa-ter The cap-tain pre-sent-ed a pis-tol With one foot on each prow of the yoked war ca-noes the Lake-man laughed him to scorn as-sur-ing him that if the pis-tol so much as clicked in the lock he would bury him in bub-bles and foam   What do you want of me  cried the cap-tain   Where are you bound and for what are you bound  de-mand-ed Steelk-ilt  no lies    I am bound to Tahi-ti for more men    Very good Let me board you a mo-men-t I come in peace  With that he leaped from the ca-noe swam to the boat and climb-ing the gun-wale stood face to face with the cap-tain   Cross your ar-ms sir throw back your head Now re-peat af-ter me As soon as Steelk-ilt leaves me I swear to beach this boat on yon-der is-land and re-main there six days If I do not may light-nings strike me    A pret-ty schol-ar  laughed the Lake-man  Adios Senor  and leap-ing in-to the sea he swam back to his com-rades  Watch-ing the boat till it was fair-ly beached and drawn up to the roots of the co-coa nut trees Steelk-ilt made sail again and in due time ar-rived at Tahi-ti his own place of des-ti-na-tion There luck be-friend-ed him two ships were about to sail for France and were prov-i-den-tial-ly in want of pre-cise-ly that num-ber of men which the sailor head-ed They em-barked and so for ev-er got the start of their for-mer cap-tain had he been at all mind-ed to work them legal re-tri-bu-tion  Some ten days af-ter the French ships sailed the whale boat ar-rived and the cap-tain was forced to en-list some of the more civ-i-lized Tahi-tians who had been some-what used to the sea Char-ter-ing a small na-tive schooner he re-turned with them to his ves-sel and find-ing all right there again re-sumed his cruis-ings  Where Steelk-ilt now is gen-tle-men none know but up-on the is-land of Nan-tuck-et the wid-ow of Rad-ney still turns to the sea which re-fus-es to give up its dead still in dreams sees the aw-ful white whale that de-stroyed him   Are you through  said Don Se-bas-tian qui-et-ly   I am Don    Then I en-treat you tell me if to the best of your own con-vic-tions this your sto-ry is in sub-stance re-al-ly true It is so pass-ing won-der-ful Did you get it from an un-ques-tion-able source Bear with me if I seem to press    Al-so bear with all of us sir sailor for we all join in Don Se-bas-tian s suit  cried the com-pa-ny with ex-ceed-ing in-ter-est   Is there a copy of the Holy Evan-ge-lists in the Gold-en Inn gen-tle-men    Nay  said Don Se-bas-tian  but I know a wor-thy priest near by who will quick-ly pro-cure one for me I go for it but are you well ad-vised this may grow too se-ri-ous    Will you be so good as to bring the priest al-so Don    Though there are no Au-to da F s in Li-ma now  said one of the com-pa-ny to an-oth-er  I fear our sailor friend runs risk of the archiepis-co-pa-cy Let us with-draw more out of the moon-light I see no need of this    Ex-cuse me for run-ning af-ter you Don Se-bas-tian but may I al-so beg that you will be par-tic-u-lar in procur-ing the largest sized Evan-ge-lists you can    This is the priest he brings you the Evan-ge-lists  said Don Se-bas-tian grave-ly re-turn-ing with a tall and solemn fig-ure   Let me re-move my hat Now ven-er-a-ble priest fur-ther in-to the light and hold the Holy Book be-fore me that I may touch it   So help me Heav-en and on my hon-or the sto-ry I have told ye gen-tle-men is in sub-stance and its great items true I know it to be true it hap-pened on this ball I trod the ship I knew the crew I have seen and talked with Steelk-ilt since the death of Rad-ney   CHAPTER 55 Of the Mon-strous Pic-tures of Whales I shall ere long paint to you as well as one can with-out can-vas some-thing like the true form of the whale as he ac-tu-al-ly ap-pears to the eye of the whale-man when in his own ab-so-lute body the whale is moored alongside the whale ship so that he can be fair-ly stepped up-on there It may be worth while there-fore pre-vi-ous-ly to ad-vert to those cu-ri-ous imag-i-nary por-traits of him which even down to the pre-sent day con-fi-dent-ly chal-lenge the faith of the lands-man It is time to set the world right in this mat-ter by prov-ing such pic-tures of the whale all wrong It may be that the pri-mal source of all those pic-to-ri-al delu-sions will be found among the old-est Hin-doo Egyp-tian and Gre-cian sculp-tures For ev-er since those in-ven-tive but un-scrupu-lous times when on the mar-ble pan-ellings of tem-ples the pedestals of stat-ues and on shields medal-lions cups and coins the dol-phin was drawn in scales of chain ar-mor like Sal-ad-in s and a hel-met-ed head like St Ge-orge s ev-er since then has some-thing of the same sort of li-cense pre-vailed not on-ly in most pop-u-lar pic-tures of the whale but in many sci-en-tific pre-sen-ta-tions of him Now by all odds the most an-cient ex-tant por-trait any-ways pur-port-ing to be the whale s is to be found in the fa-mous cav-ern pago-da of Ele-phan-ta in In-dia The Brah-mins main-tain that in the al-most end-less sculp-tures of that im-memo-ri-al pago-da all the trades and pur-suits ev-ery con-ceiv-able av-o-ca-tion of man were pre-fig-ured ages be-fore any of them ac-tu-al-ly came in-to be-ing No won-der then that in some sort our no-ble pro-fes-sion of whal-ing should have been there shad-owed forth The Hin-doo whale re-ferred to oc-curs in a sep-a-rate de-part-ment of the wall de-pict-ing the in-car-na-tion of Vish-nu in the form of leviathan learned-ly known as the Mat-se Avatar But though this sculp-ture is half man and half whale so as on-ly to give the tail of the lat-ter yet that small sec-tion of him is all wrong It looks more like the ta-per-ing tail of an ana-con-da than the broad palms of the true whale s ma-jes-tic flukes But go to the old Gal-leries and look now at a great Chris-tian painter s por-trait of this fish for he suc-ceeds no bet-ter than the an-te-dilu-vian Hin-doo It is Guido s pic-ture of Perseus res-cu-ing An-dromeda from the sea mon-ster or whale Where did Guido get the mod-el of such a strange crea-ture as that Nor does Hog-a-rth in paint-ing the same scene in his own  Perseus Descend-ing  make out one whit bet-ter The huge cor-pu-lence of that Hog-a-rthi-an mon-ster un-du-lates on the sur-face scarce-ly draw-ing one inch of wa-ter It has a sort of how-dah on its back and its dis-tend-ed tusked mouth in-to which the bil-lows are rolling might be tak-en for the Traitors Gate lead-ing from the Thames by wa-ter in-to the Tow-er Then there are the Pro-dro-mus whales of old Scotch Sib-bald and Jon-ah s whale as de-pict-ed in the prints of old Bi-bles and the cuts of old primers What shall be said of the-se As for the book binder s whale wind-ing like a vine stalk round the stock of a de-scend-ing an-chor as stamped and gild-ed on the backs and ti-tle pages of many books both old and new that is a very pic-turesque but pure-ly fab-u-lous crea-ture im-i-tat-ed I take it from the like fig-ures on an-tique vas-es Though uni-ver-sal-ly de-nom-i-nat-ed a dol-phin I nev-er-the-less call this book binder s fish an at-tempt at a whale be-cause it was so in-tend-ed when the de-vice was first in-tro-duced It was in-tro-duced by an old Ital-ian pub-lish-er some-where about the 15th cen-tu-ry dur-ing the Re-vival of Learn-ing and in those days and even down to a com-par-a-tive-ly late pe-ri-od dol-phins were pop-u-lar-ly sup-posed to be a species of the Le-viathan In the vi-gnettes and oth-er em-bel-lish-men-ts of some an-cient books you will at times meet with very cu-ri-ous touch-es at the whale where all man-ner of spouts jets d eau hot springs and cold Sarato-ga and Baden Baden come bub-bling up from his un-ex-haust-ed brain In the ti-tle page of the orig-i-nal edi-tion of the  Ad-vance-ment of Learn-ing you will find some cu-ri-ous whales But quit-ting all the-se un-pro-fes-sion-al at-temp-ts let us glance at those pic-tures of leviathan pur-port-ing to be sober sci-en-tific de-lin-eations by those who know In old Har-ris s col-lec-tion of voy-ages there are some plates of whales ex-tract-ed from a Dutch book of voy-ages A D 1671 en-ti-tled  A Whal-ing Voy-age to Spitzber-gen in the ship Jonas in the Whale Peter Peter-son of Fries-land mas-ter  In one of those plates the whales like great rafts of logs are rep-re-sent-ed ly-ing among ice isles with white bears run-ning over their liv-ing backs In an-oth-er plate the prodi-gious blun-der is made of rep-re-sent-ing the whale with per-pen-dic-u-lar flukes Then again there is an im-pos-ing quar-to writ-ten by one Cap-tain Col-nett a Post Cap-tain in the English navy en-ti-tled  A Voy-age round Cape Horn in-to the South Seas for the pur-pose of ex-tend-ing the Sper-ma-ceti Whale Fish-eries  In this book is an out-line pur-port-ing to be a  Pic-ture of a Phy-seter or Sper-ma-ceti whale drawn by scale from one killed on the coast of Mex-i-co Au-gust 1793 and hoist-ed on deck  I doubt not the cap-tain had this ve-ra-cious pic-ture tak-en for the ben-e-fit of his mari-nes To men-tion but one thing about it let me say that it has an eye which ap-plied ac-cord-ing to the ac-com-pa-ny-ing scale to a full grown sperm whale would make the eye of that whale a bow win-dow some five feet long Ah my gal-lant cap-tain why did ye not give us Jon-ah look-ing out of that eye Nor are the most con-sci-en-tious com-pi-la-tions of Nat-u-ral His-to-ry for the ben-e-fit of the young and ten-der free from the same heinous-ness of mis-take Look at that pop-u-lar work  Gold-smith s An-i-mat-ed Na-ture  In the abridged Lon-don edi-tion of 187 there are plates of an al-leged  whale and a  nar-whale  I do not wish to seem in-el-e-gant but this un-sight-ly whale looks much like an am-pu-tat-ed sow and as for the nar-whale one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one that in this nine-teen-th cen-tu-ry such a hip-pogriff could be palmed for gen-uine up-on any in-tel-li-gent pub-lic of school-boys Then again in 1825 Bernard Ger-main Count de Lac p de a great nat-u-ral-ist pub-lished a sci-en-tific sys-tem-ized whale book where-in are sev-er-al pic-tures of the dif-fer-ent species of the Le-viathan All the-se are not on-ly in-cor-rect but the pic-ture of the Mys-tice-tus or Green-land whale that is to say the Right whale even Scores-by a long ex-pe-ri-enced man as touch-ing that species de-clares not to have its coun-ter-part in na-ture But the plac-ing of the cap sheaf to all this blun-der-ing busi-ness was re-served for the sci-en-tific Fred-er-ick Cu-vier broth-er to the fa-mous Baron In 1836 he pub-lished a Nat-u-ral His-to-ry of Whales in which he gives what he cal-ls a pic-ture of the Sperm Whale Be-fore show-ing that pic-ture to any Nan-tuck-eter you had best provide for your sum-ma-ry re-treat from Nan-tuck-et In a word Fred-er-ick Cu-vier s Sperm Whale is not a Sperm Whale but a squash Of course he nev-er had the ben-e-fit of a whal-ing voy-age such men sel-dom have but whence he de-rived that pic-ture who can tell Per-haps he got it as his sci-en-tific pre-de-ces-sor in the same field Des-marest got one of his au-then-tic abor-tions that is from a Chi-ne-se draw-ing And what sort of live-ly lads with the pen-cil those Chi-ne-se are many queer cups and saucers in-form us As for the sign painter-s whales seen in the streets hang-ing over the shops of oil deal-ers what shall be said of them They are gen-er-al-ly Richard III whales with dromedary humps and very sav-age break-fast-ing on three or four sailor tarts that is whale-boats full of mariners their de-for-mi-ties floun-der-ing in seas of blood and blue paint But the-se man-i-fold mis-takes in de-pict-ing the whale are not so very sur-pris-ing af-ter all Con-sid-er Most of the sci-en-tific draw-ings have been tak-en from the strand-ed fish and the-se are about as cor-rect as a draw-ing of a wrecked ship with bro-ken back would cor-rect-ly rep-re-sent the no-ble an-i-mal it-self in all its un-dashed pride of hull and spars Though ele-phan-ts have stood for their full lengths the liv-ing Le-viathan has nev-er yet fair-ly float-ed him-self for his por-trait The liv-ing whale in his full majesty and sig-nif-i-cance is on-ly to be seen at sea in un-fath-omable wa-ters and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight like a launched line of bat-tle ship and out of that el-e-ment it is a thing eter-nal-ly im-pos-si-ble for mor-tal man to hoist him bod-i-ly in-to the air so as to pre-serve all his mighty swells and un-du-la-tions And not to speak of the high-ly pre-sum-able dif-fer-ence of con-tour be-tween a young suck-ing whale and a full grown Pla-to-ni-an Le-viathan yet even in the case of one of those young suck-ing whales hoist-ed to a ship s deck such is then the out-landish eel like lim-bered vary-ing shape of him that his pre-cise ex-pres-sion the dev-il him-self could not catch But it may be fan-cied that from the naked skele-ton of the strand-ed whale ac-cu-rate hin-ts may be de-rived touch-ing his true form Not at all For it is one of the more cu-ri-ous things about this Le-viathan that his skele-ton gives very lit-tle idea of his gen-er-al shape Though Jere-my Ben-tham s skele-ton which hangs for can-de-labra in the li-brary of one of his ex-ecu-tors cor-rect-ly con-veys the idea of a burly browed util-i-tar-i-an old gen-tle-man with all Jere-my s oth-er lead-ing per-son-al char-ac-ter-is-tics yet noth-ing of this kind could be in-ferred from any leviathan s ar-tic-u-lat-ed bones In fact as the great Hun-ter says the mere skele-ton of the whale bears the same re-la-tion to the ful-ly in-vest-ed and padded an-i-mal as the in-sect does to the chrysal-is that so round-ing-ly en-velopes it This pe-cu-liar-i-ty is strik-ing-ly evinced in the head as in some part of this book will be in-ci-den-tal-ly shown It is al-so very cu-ri-ous-ly dis-played in the side fin the bones of which al-most ex-act-ly an-swer to the bones of the hu-man hand mi-nus on-ly the thumb This fin has four reg-u-lar bone fin-gers the in-dex mid-dle ring and lit-tle fin-ger But all the-se are per-ma-nent-ly lodged in their fleshy cov-er-ing as the hu-man fin-gers in an ar-ti-fi-cial cov-er-ing  How-ev-er reck-less-ly the whale may some-times serve us  said hu-mor-ous Stubb one day  he can nev-er be tru-ly said to han-dle us with-out mit-tens  For all the-se rea-sons then any way you may look at it you must needs con-clude that the great Le-viathan is that one crea-ture in the world which must re-main un-paint-ed to the last True one por-trait may hit the mark much nearer than an-oth-er but none can hit it with any very con-sid-er-able de-gree of ex-act-ness So there is no earth-ly way of find-ing out pre-cise-ly what the whale re-al-ly looks like And the on-ly mode in which you can de-rive even a tol-er-a-ble idea of his liv-ing con-tour is by go-ing a whal-ing your-self but by so do-ing you run no small risk of be-ing eter-nal-ly stove and sunk by him Where-fore it seems to me you had best not be too fas-tid-i-ous in your cu-rios-i-ty touch-ing this Le-viathan CHAPTER 56 Of the Less Er-ro-neous Pic-tures of Whales and the True Pic-tures of Whal-ing Sce-nes In con-nex-ion with the mon-strous pic-tures of whales I am strong-ly tempt-ed here to en-ter up-on those still more mon-strous sto-ries of them which are to be found in cer-tain books both an-cient and mod-ern es-pe-cial-ly in Pliny Pur-chas Hack-luyt Har-ris Cu-vier etc But I pass that mat-ter by I know of on-ly four pub-lished out-li-nes of the great Sperm Whale Col-net-t s Hug-gin-s s Fred-er-ick Cu-vier s and Beale s In the pre-vi-ous chap-ter Col-nett and Cu-vier have been re-ferred to Hug-gin-s s is far bet-ter than theirs but by great odds Beale s is the best All Beale s draw-ings of this whale are good ex-cept-ing the mid-dle fig-ure in the pic-ture of three whales in var-i-ous at-ti-tudes cap-ping his sec-ond chap-ter His fron-tispiece boats at-tack-ing Sperm Whales though no doubt cal-cu-lat-ed to ex-cite the civil scep-ti-cism of some par-lor men is ad-mirably cor-rect and life like in its gen-er-al ef-fect Some of the Sperm Whale draw-ings in J Ross Browne are pret-ty cor-rect in con-tour but they are wretched-ly en-graved That is not his fault though Of the Right Whale the best out-line pic-tures are in Scores-by but they are drawn on too small a scale to con-vey a de-sir-able im-pres-sion He has but one pic-ture of whal-ing sce-nes and this is a sad de-fi-cien-cy be-cause it is by such pic-tures on-ly when at all well done that you can de-rive any-thing like a truth-ful idea of the liv-ing whale as seen by his liv-ing hunters But tak-en for all in all by far the finest though in some de-tails not the most cor-rect pre-sen-ta-tions of whales and whal-ing sce-nes to be any-where found are two large French en-grav-ings well ex-e-cut-ed and tak-en from paint-ings by one Garn-ery Re-spec-tive-ly they rep-re-sent at-tacks on the Sperm and Right Whale In the first en-grav-ing a no-ble Sperm Whale is de-pict-ed in full majesty of might just risen be-neath the boat from the pro-fun-di-ties of the ocean and bear-ing high in the air up-on his back the ter-ri-fic wreck of the stoven planks The prow of the boat is par-tial-ly un-bro-ken and is drawn just bal-anc-ing up-on the mon-ster s spine and stand-ing in that prow for that one sin-gle in-com-putable flash of time you be-hold an oars-man half shroud-ed by the in-censed boil-ing spout of the whale and in the act of leap-ing as if from a precipice The ac-tion of the whole thing is won-der-ful-ly good and true The half emp-tied line tub floats on the whitened sea the wood-en poles of the spilled har-poons oblique-ly bob in it the heads of the swim-ming crew are scat-tered about the whale in con-trast-ing ex-pres-sions of af-fright while in the black stormy dis-tance the ship is bear-ing down up-on the scene Se-ri-ous fault might be found with the anatom-i-cal de-tails of this whale but let that pass since for the life of me I could not draw so good a one In the sec-ond en-grav-ing the boat is in the act of draw-ing alongside the bar-na-cled flank of a large run-ning Right Whale that rol-ls his black weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock slide from the Patag-o-ni-an cliffs His jets are erect full and black like soot so that from so abound-ing a smoke in the chim-ney you would think there must be a brave sup-per cook-ing in the great bow-els be-low Sea fowls are peck-ing at the small crabs shell fish and oth-er sea can-dies and mac-ca-roni which the Right Whale some-times car-ries on his pesti-lent back And all the while the thick lipped leviathan is rush-ing through the deep leav-ing tons of tu-mul-tuous white cur-ds in his wake and caus-ing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a skiff caught nigh the pad-dle wheels of an ocean steam-er Thus the fore-ground is all rag-ing com-mo-tion but be-hind in ad-mirable artis-tic con-trast is the glassy lev-el of a sea be-calmed the droop-ing un-starched sails of the pow-er-less ship and the in-ert mass of a dead whale a con-quered fortress with the flag of cap-ture lazi-ly hang-ing from the whale pole in-sert-ed in-to his spout hole Who Garn-ery the painter is or was I know not But my life for it he was ei-ther prac-ti-cal-ly con-ver-sant with his sub-ject or else mar-vel-lous-ly tu-tored by some ex-pe-ri-enced whale-man The French are the lads for paint-ing ac-tion Go and gaze up-on all the paint-ings of Europe and where will you find such a gallery of liv-ing and breath-ing com-mo-tion on can-vas as in that tri-umphal hall at Ver-sailles where the be-hold-er fights his way pell mell through the con-sec-u-tive great bat-tles of France where ev-ery sword seems a flash of the North-ern Lights and the suc-ces-sive armed kings and Em-per-ors dash by like a charge of crowned cen-tau-rs Not whol-ly un-wor-thy of a place in that gallery are the-se sea bat-tle pieces of Garn-ery The nat-u-ral ap-ti-tude of the French for seiz-ing the pic-turesque-ness of things seems to be pe-cu-liar-ly evinced in what paint-ings and en-grav-ings they have of their whal-ing sce-nes With not one ten-th of Eng-land s ex-pe-ri-ence in the fish-ery and not the thou-sandth part of that of the Amer-i-cans they have nev-er-the-less fur-nished both na-tions with the on-ly fin-ished sketch-es at all ca-pa-ble of con-vey-ing the re-al spir-it of the whale hunt For the most part the English and Amer-i-can whale draughts-men seem en-tire-ly con-tent with pre-sent-ing the me-chan-i-cal out-line of things such as the va-cant pro-file of the whale which so far as pic-turesque-ness of ef-fect is con-cerned is about tan-ta-mount to sketch-ing the pro-file of a pyra-mid Even Scores-by the just-ly renowned Right whale-man af-ter giv-ing us a stiff full length of the Green-land whale and three or four del-i-cate minia-tures of nar-whales and por-pois-es treats us to a se-ries of clas-si-cal en-grav-ings of boat hooks chop-ping knives and grap-nels and with the mi-cro-scop-ic dili-gence of a Leuwen-hoeck sub-mits to the in-spec-tion of a shiv-er-ing world nine-ty six fac sim-i-les of mag-ni-fied Arc-tic snow crys-tals I mean no dis-par-age-ment to the ex-cel-lent voy-ager I hon-or him for a vet-er-an but in so im-por-tant a mat-ter it was cer-tain-ly an over-sight not to have pro-cured for ev-ery crys-tal a sworn af-fi-davit tak-en be-fore a Green-land Jus-tice of the Peace In ad-di-tion to those fine en-grav-ings from Garn-ery there are two oth-er French en-grav-ings wor-thy of note by some one who sub-scribes him-self  H Du-rand  One of them though not pre-cise-ly adapt-ed to our pre-sent pur-pose nev-er-the-less de-serves men-tion on oth-er ac-coun-ts It is a qui-et noon scene among the isles of the Paci-fic a French whaler an-chored in-shore in a calm and lazi-ly tak-ing wa-ter on board the loos-ened sails of the ship and the long leaves of the palms in the back-ground both droop-ing to-geth-er in the breeze-less air The ef-fect is very fine when con-sid-ered with ref-er-ence to its pre-sent-ing the hardy fish-er-men un-der one of their few as-pec-ts of ori-en-tal re-pose The oth-er en-grav-ing is quite a dif-fer-ent af-fair the ship hove to up-on the open sea and in the very heart of the Le-viathanic life with a Right Whale alongside the ves-sel in the act of cut-ting in hove over to the mon-ster as if to a quay and a boat hur-ried-ly push-ing off from this scene of ac-tiv-i-ty is about giv-ing chase to whales in the dis-tance The har-poons and lances lie lev-elled for use three oars-men are just set-ting the mast in its hole while from a sud-den roll of the sea the lit-tle craft stands half erect out of the wa-ter like a rear-ing horse From the ship the smoke of the tor-men-ts of the boil-ing whale is go-ing up like the smoke over a vil-lage of smithies and to wind-ward a black cloud ris-ing up with earnest of squalls and rains seems to quick-en the ac-tiv-i-ty of the ex-cit-ed sea-men CHAPTER 57 Of Whales in Paint in Teeth in Wood in Sheet Iron in Stone in Moun-tains in Stars On Tow-er hill as you go down to the Lon-don docks you may have seen a crip-pled beg-gar or kedger as the sailors say hold-ing a paint-ed board be-fore him rep-re-sent-ing the trag-ic scene in which he lost his leg There are three whales and three boats and one of the boats pre-sumed to con-tain the miss-ing leg in all its orig-i-nal in-tegri-ty is be-ing crunched by the jaws of the fore-most whale Any time the-se ten years they tell me has that man held up that pic-ture and ex-hib-it-ed that stump to an in-cred-u-lous world But the time of his jus-ti-fi-ca-tion has now come His three whales are as good whales as were ev-er pub-lished in Wap-ping at any rate and his stump as un-ques-tion-able a stump as any you will find in the west-ern clear-ings But though for ev-er mount-ed on that stump nev-er a stump speech does the poor whale-man make but with down-cast eyes stands rue-ful-ly con-tem-plat-ing his own am-pu-ta-tion Through-out the Paci-fic and al-so in Nan-tuck-et and New Bed-ford and Sag Har-bor you will come across live-ly sketch-es of whales and whal-ing sce-nes graven by the fish-er-men them-selves on Sperm Whale teeth or ladies busks wrought out of the Right Whale bone and oth-er like skrimshan-der ar-ti-cles as the whale-men call the nu-mer-ous lit-tle in-ge-nious con-trivances they elab-o-rate-ly carve out of the rough ma-te-ri-al in their hours of ocean leisure Some of them have lit-tle box-es of den-tis-ti-cal look-ing im-ple-men-ts spe-cial-ly in-tend-ed for the skrimshan-der-ing busi-ness But in gen-er-al they toil with their jack knives alone and with that al-most om-nipo-tent tool of the sailor they will turn you out any-thing you please in the way of a mariner s fan-cy Long ex-ile from Chris-ten-dom and civ-i-liza-tion in-evitably re-stores a man to that con-di-tion in which God placed him i e what is called sav-agery Your true whale hunter is as much a sav-age as an Iro-quois I my-self am a sav-age own-ing no al-le-giance but to the King of the Can-ni-bals and ready at any mo-ment to re-bel again-st him Now one of the pe-cu-liar char-ac-ter-is-tics of the sav-age in his do-mes-tic hours is his won-der-ful pa-tience of in-dus-try An an-cient Hawai-ian war club or spear pad-dle in its full mul-ti-plic-i-ty and elab-o-ra-tion of carv-ing is as great a tro-phy of hu-man per-se-ver-ance as a Lat-in lex-i-con For with but a bit of bro-ken sea shell or a shark s tooth that mirac-u-lous in-tri-ca-cy of wood-en net work has been achieved and it has cost steady years of steady ap-pli-ca-tion As with the Hawai-ian sav-age so with the white sailor sav-age With the same mar-vel-lous pa-tience and with the same sin-gle shark s tooth of his one poor jack knife he will carve you a bit of bone sculp-ture not quite as work-man-like but as close packed in its mazi-ness of de-sign as the Greek sav-age Achilles s shield and full of bar-bar-ic spir-it and sug-ges-tive-ness as the prints of that fine old Dutch sav-age Al-bert Durer Wood-en whales or whales cut in pro-file out of the small dark slabs of the no-ble South Sea war wood are fre-quent-ly met with in the fore-castles of Amer-i-can whalers Some of them are done with much ac-cu-ra-cy At some old gable roofed coun-try hous-es you will see brass whales hung by the tail for knock-ers to the road side door When the porter is sleepy the anvil head-ed whale would be best But the-se knock-ing whales are sel-dom re-mark-able as faith-ful es-says On the spires of some old fash-ioned church-es you will see sheet iron whales placed there for weath-er cocks but they are so el-e-vat-ed and be-sides that are to all in-ten-ts and pur-pos-es so la-belled with  Hands off  you can-not ex-am-ine them close-ly enough to de-cide up-on their mer-it In bony rib-by re-gions of the earth where at the base of high bro-ken cliffs mass-es of rock lie strewn in fan-tas-tic group-ings up-on the plain you will of-ten dis-cov-er im-ages as of the pet-ri-fied for-ms of the Le-viathan part-ly merged in grass which of a windy day breaks again-st them in a surf of green surges Then again in moun-tain-ous coun-tries where the trav-eller is con-tin-u-al-ly gir-dled by am-phithe-atri-cal heights here and there from some lucky point of view you will catch pass-ing glimpses of the pro-files of whales de-fined along the un-du-lat-ing ridges But you must be a thor-ough whale-man to see the-se sights and not on-ly that but if you wish to re-turn to such a sight again you must be sure and take the ex-act in-ter-sect-ing lat-i-tude and lon-gi-tude of your first stand point else so chance like are such ob-ser-va-tions of the hills that your pre-cise pre-vi-ous stand point would re-quire a la-bo-ri-ous re dis-cov-ery like the Solo-ma Is-lands which still re-main incog-ni-ta though on-ce high ruffed Men-dan-na trod them and old Figuera chron-i-cled them Nor when ex-pand-ing-ly lift-ed by your sub-ject can you fail to trace out great whales in the star-ry heav-ens and boats in pur-suit of them as when long filled with thoughts of war the Eastern na-tions saw armies locked in bat-tle among the clouds Thus at the North have I chased Le-viathan round and round the Pole with the rev-o-lu-tions of the bright points that first de-fined him to me And be-neath the ef-ful-gent Antarc-tic skies I have board-ed the Ar-go Nav-is and joined the chase again-st the star-ry Ce-tus far be-yond the ut-most stretch of Hy-drus and the Fly-ing Fish With a frigate s an-chors for my bri-dle bit-ts and fasces of har-poons for spurs would I could mount that whale and leap the top-most skies to see whether the fa-bled heav-ens with all their count-less ten-ts re-al-ly lie en-camped be-yond my mor-tal sight CHAPTER 58 Brit Steer-ing north east-ward from the Crozetts we fell in with vast mead-ows of brit the min-ute yel-low sub-stance up-on which the Right Whale large-ly feeds For leagues and leagues it un-du-lat-ed round us so that we seemed to be sail-ing through bound-less fields of ripe and gold-en wheat On the sec-ond day num-bers of Right Whales were seen who se-cure from the at-tack of a Sperm Whaler like the Pe-quod with open jaws slug-gish-ly swam through the brit which ad-her-ing to the fring-ing fi-bres of that won-drous Vene-tian blind in their mouths was in that man-ner sep-a-rat-ed from the wa-ter that es-caped at the lip As morn-ing mow-ers who side by side slow-ly and seething-ly ad-vance their scythes through the long wet grass of marshy meads even so the-se mon-sters swam mak-ing a strange grassy cut-ting sound and leav-ing be-hind them end-less swaths of blue up-on the yel-low sea That part of the sea known among whale-men as the  Brazil Banks does not bear that name as the Banks of New-found-land do be-cause of there be-ing shal-lows and sound-ings there but be-cause of this re-mark-able mead-ow like ap-pear-ance caused by the vast drifts of brit con-tin-u-al-ly float-ing in those lat-i-tudes where the Right Whale is of-ten chased But it was on-ly the sound they made as they part-ed the brit which at all re-mind-ed one of mow-ers Seen from the mast heads es-pe-cial-ly when they paused and were sta-tion-ary for a while their vast black for-ms looked more like life-less mass-es of rock than any-thing else And as in the great hunt-ing coun-tries of In-dia the stranger at a dis-tance will some-times pass on the plains re-cum-bent ele-phan-ts with-out know-ing them to be such tak-ing them for bare black-ened el-e-va-tions of the soil even so of-ten with him who for the first time be-holds this species of the leviathans of the sea And even when recog-nised at last their im-mense mag-ni-tude ren-ders it very hard re-al-ly to be-lieve that such bulky mass-es of over-growth can pos-si-bly be in-stinct in all parts with the same sort of life that lives in a dog or a horse In-deed in oth-er re-spec-ts you can hard-ly re-gard any crea-tures of the deep with the same feel-ings that you do those of the shore For though some old nat-u-ral-ists have main-tained that all crea-tures of the land are of their kind in the sea and though tak-ing a broad gen-er-al view of the thing this may very well be yet com-ing to spe-cialties where for ex-am-ple does the ocean fur-nish any fish that in dis-po-si-tion an-swers to the saga-cious kind-ness of the dog The ac-cursed shark alone can in any gener-ic re-spect be said to bear com-par-a-tive anal-o-gy to him But though to lands-men in gen-er-al the na-tive in-hab-i-tan-ts of the seas have ev-er been re-gard-ed with emo-tions un-speak-ably unso-cial and re-pelling though we know the sea to be an ev-er-last-ing ter-ra incog-ni-ta so that Colum-bus sailed over num-ber-less un-known worlds to dis-cov-er his one su-per-fi-cial west-ern one though by vast odds the most ter-ri-fic of all mor-tal dis-as-ters have im-memo-ri-al-ly and in-dis-crim-i-nate-ly be-fal-l-en tens and hun-dreds of thou-sands of those who have gone up-on the wa-ters though but a mo-men-t s con-sid-er-a-tion will teach that how-ev-er baby man may brag of his sci-ence and skill and how-ev-er much in a flat-ter-ing fu-ture that sci-ence and skill may aug-ment yet for ev-er and for ev-er to the crack of doom the sea will in-sult and mur-der him and pul-ver-ize the stateliest stiffest frigate he can make nev-er-the-less by the con-tin-u-al rep-e-ti-tion of the-se very im-pres-sions man has lost that sense of the full aw-ful-ness of the sea which abo-rig-i-nal-ly be-longs to it The first boat we read of float-ed on an ocean that with Por-tugue-se vengeance had whelmed a whole world with-out leav-ing so much as a wid-ow That same ocean rol-ls now that same ocean de-stroyed the wrecked ships of last year Yea fool-ish mor-tals Noah s flood is not yet sub-sid-ed two thirds of the fair world it yet cov-ers Where-in dif-fer the sea and the land that a mir-a-cle up-on one is not a mir-a-cle up-on the oth-er Preter-nat-u-ral ter-rors rest-ed up-on the He-brews when un-der the feet of Ko-rah and his com-pa-ny the live ground opened and swal-lowed them up for ev-er yet not a mod-ern sun ev-er sets but in pre-cise-ly the same man-ner the live sea swal-lows up ships and crews But not on-ly is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it but it is al-so a fiend to its own off spring worse than the Per-sian host who mur-dered his own guests spar-ing not the crea-tures which it-self hath spawned Like a sav-age ti-gress that toss-ing in the jun-gle over-lays her own cubs so the sea dash-es even the might-i-est whales again-st the rocks and leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks of ships No mer-cy no pow-er but its own con-trols it Pant-ing and snort-ing like a mad bat-tle steed that has lost its rid-er the mas-ter-less ocean over-runs the globe Con-sid-er the sub-tle-ness of the sea how its most dread-ed crea-tures glide un-der wa-ter un-ap-par-ent for the most part and treach-er-ous-ly hid-den be-neath the loveli-est tin-ts of azure Con-sid-er al-so the dev-il-ish bril-liance and beau-ty of many of its most re-morse-less tribes as the dain-ty em-bel-lished shape of many species of sharks Con-sid-er on-ce more the uni-ver-sal can-ni-bal-ism of the sea all whose crea-tures prey up-on each oth-er car-ry-ing on eter-nal war since the world be-gan Con-sid-er all this and then turn to this green gen-tle and most docile earth con-sid-er them both the sea and the land and do you not find a strange anal-o-gy to some-thing in your-self For as this ap-palling ocean sur-rounds the ver-dant land so in the soul of man there lies one in-su-lar Tahi-ti full of peace and joy but en-com-passed by all the hor-rors of the half known life God keep thee Push not off from that isle thou canst nev-er re-turn CHAPTER 59 Squid Slow-ly wad-ing through the mead-ows of brit the Pe-quod still held on her way north east-ward to-wards the is-land of Java a gen-tle air im-pelling her keel so that in the sur-round-ing seren-i-ty her three tall ta-per-ing mas-ts mild-ly waved to that lan-guid breeze as three mild palms on a plain And still at wide in-ter-vals in the sil-very night the lone-ly al-lur-ing jet would be seen But one trans-par-ent blue morn-ing when a still-ness al-most preter-nat-u-ral spread over the sea how-ev-er unat-tend-ed with any stag-nant calm when the long bur-nished sun glade on the wa-ters seemed a gold-en fin-ger laid across them en-join-ing some se-cre-cy when the slip-pered waves whis-pered to-geth-er as they soft-ly ran on in this pro-found hush of the vis-i-ble sphere a strange spec-tre was seen by Dag-goo from the main mast head In the dis-tance a great white mass lazi-ly rose and ris-ing high-er and high-er and dis-en-tan-gling it-self from the azure at last gleamed be-fore our prow like a snow slide new slid from the hills Thus glis-ten-ing for a mo-ment as slow-ly it sub-sid-ed and sank Then on-ce more arose and silent-ly gleamed It seemed not a whale and yet is this Moby Dick thought Dag-goo Again the phan-tom went down but on re ap-pear-ing on-ce more with a stilet-to like cry that star-tled ev-ery man from his nod the ne-gro yelled out  There there again there she breach-es right ahead The White Whale the White Whale  Upon this the sea-men rushed to the yard ar-ms as in swarm-ing time the bees rush to the boughs Bare head-ed in the sul-try sun Ahab stood on the bowsprit and with one hand pushed far be-hind in readi-ness to wave his or-ders to the helms-man cast his ea-ger glance in the di-rec-tion in-di-cat-ed aloft by the out-stretched mo-tion-less arm of Dag-goo Whether the flit-ting at-ten-dance of the one still and soli-tary jet had grad-u-al-ly worked up-on Ahab so that he was now pre-pared to con-nect the ideas of mild-ness and re-pose with the first sight of the par-tic-u-lar whale he pur-sued how-ev-er this was or whether his ea-ger-ness be-trayed him whichev-er way it might have been no soon-er did he dis-tinct-ly per-ceive the white mass than with a quick in-ten-si-ty he in-stant-ly gave or-ders for low-er-ing The four boats were soon on the wa-ter Ahab s in ad-vance and all swift-ly pulling to-wards their prey Soon it went down and while with oars sus-pend-ed we were await-ing its reap-pear-ance lo in the same spot where it sank on-ce more it slow-ly rose Al-most for-get-ting for the mo-ment all thoughts of Moby Dick we now gazed at the most won-drous phe-nomenon which the se-cret seas have hith-er-to re-vealed to mankind A vast pulpy mass fur-longs in length and breadth of a glanc-ing cream colour lay float-ing on the wa-ter in-nu-mer-able long ar-ms ra-di-at-ing from its cen-tre and curling and twist-ing like a nest of ana-con-das as if blind-ly to clutch at any hap-less ob-ject with-in reach No per-cep-ti-ble face or front did it have no con-ceiv-able to-ken of ei-ther sen-sa-tion or in-stinct but un-du-lat-ed there on the bil-lows an un-earth-ly form-less chance like ap-pari-tion of life As with a low suck-ing sound it slow-ly dis-ap-peared again Star-buck still gaz-ing at the ag-i-tat-ed wa-ters where it had sunk with a wild voice ex-claimed  Al-most rather had I seen Moby Dick and fought him than to have seen thee thou white ghost   What was it Sir  said Flask  The great live squid which they say few whale ships ev-er be-held and re-turned to their ports to tell of it  But Ahab said noth-ing turn-ing his boat he sailed back to the ves-sel the rest as silent-ly fol-low-ing What-ev-er su-per-sti-tions the sperm whale-men in gen-er-al have con-nect-ed with the sight of this ob-ject cer-tain it is that a glimpse of it be-ing so very un-usu-al that cir-cum-stance has gone far to in-vest it with por-ten-tous-ness So rarely is it be-held that though one and all of them de-clare it to be the largest an-i-mat-ed thing in the ocean yet very few of them have any but the most vague ideas con-cern-ing its true na-ture and form notwith-stand-ing they be-lieve it to fur-nish to the sperm whale his on-ly food For though oth-er species of whales find their food above wa-ter and may be seen by man in the act of feed-ing the sper-ma-ceti whale ob-tains his whole food in un-known zones be-low the sur-face and on-ly by in-fer-ence is it that any one can tell of what pre-cise-ly that food con-sists At times when close-ly pur-sued he will dis-gorge what are sup-posed to be the de-tached ar-ms of the squid some of them thus ex-hib-it-ed ex-ceed-ing twen-ty and thir-ty feet in length They fan-cy that the mon-ster to which the-se ar-ms be-longed or-di-nar-i-ly clings by them to the bed of the ocean and that the sperm whale un-like oth-er species is sup-plied with teeth in or-der to at-tack and tear it There seems some ground to imag-ine that the great Krak-en of Bish-op Pon-top-po-dan may ul-ti-mate-ly re-solve it-self in-to Squid The man-ner in which the Bish-op de-scribes it as al-ter-nate-ly ris-ing and sink-ing with some oth-er par-tic-u-lars he nar-rates in all this the two cor-re-spond But much abate-ment is nec-es-sary with re-spect to the in-cred-i-ble bulk he as-signs it By some nat-u-ral-ists who have vague-ly heard ru-mors of the mys-te-ri-ous crea-ture here spo-ken of it is in-clud-ed among the class of cut-tle fish to which in-deed in cer-tain ex-ter-nal re-spec-ts it would seem to be-long but on-ly as the Anak of the tribe CHAPTER 6 The Line With ref-er-ence to the whal-ing scene short-ly to be de-scribed as well as for the bet-ter un-der-stand-ing of all sim-i-lar sce-nes else-where pre-sent-ed I have here to speak of the mag-i-cal some-times hor-ri-ble whale line The line orig-i-nal-ly used in the fish-ery was of the best hemp slight-ly va-pored with tar not im-preg-nat-ed with it as in the case of or-di-nary ropes for while tar as or-di-nar-i-ly used makes the hemp more pli-able to the rope mak-er and al-so ren-ders the rope it-self more con-ve-nient to the sailor for com-mon ship use yet not on-ly would the or-di-nary quan-ti-ty too much stiff-en the whale line for the close coil-ing to which it must be sub-ject-ed but as most sea-men are be-gin-ning to learn tar in gen-er-al by no means ad-ds to the rope s dura-bil-i-ty or strength how-ev-er much it may give it com-pact-ness and gloss Of late years the Manil-la rope has in the Amer-i-can fish-ery al-most en-tire-ly su-per-seded hemp as a ma-te-ri-al for whale lines for though not so durable as hemp it is stronger and far more soft and elas-tic and I will add since there is an  sthet-ics in all things is much more hand-some and be-com-ing to the boat than hemp Hemp is a dusky dark fel-low a sort of In-di-an but Manil-la is as a gold-en haired Cir-cas-sian to be-hold The whale line is on-ly two thirds of an inch in thick-ness At first sight you would not think it so strong as it re-al-ly is By ex-per-i-ment its one and fifty yarns will each sus-pend a weight of one hun-dred and twen-ty pounds so that the whole rope will bear a strain near-ly equal to three tons In length the com-mon sperm whale line mea-sures some-thing over two hun-dred fath-oms Towards the stern of the boat it is spi-ral-ly coiled away in the tub not like the worm pipe of a still though but so as to form one round cheese shaped mass of dense-ly bed-ded  sheaves  or lay-ers of con-cen-tric spi-ral-iza-tions with-out any hol-low but the  heart  or min-ute ver-ti-cal tube formed at the ax-is of the cheese As the least tan-gle or kink in the coil-ing would in run-ning out in-fal-li-bly take some-body s arm leg or en-tire body off the ut-most pre-cau-tion is used in stow-ing the line in its tub Some har-pooneers will con-sume al-most an en-tire morn-ing in this busi-ness car-ry-ing the line high aloft and then reev-ing it down-wards through a block to-wards the tub so as in the act of coil-ing to free it from all pos-si-ble wrin-kles and twists In the English boats two tubs are used in-stead of one the same line be-ing con-tin-u-ous-ly coiled in both tubs There is some ad-van-tage in this be-cause the-se twin tubs be-ing so small they fit more read-i-ly in-to the boat and do not strain it so much where-as the Amer-i-can tub near-ly three feet in di-am-e-ter and of pro-por-tion-ate depth makes a rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but one half inch in thick-ness for the bot-tom of the whale boat is like crit-i-cal ice which will bear up a con-sid-er-able dis-tribut-ed weight but not very much of a con-cen-trat-ed one When the paint-ed can-vas cov-er is clapped on the Amer-i-can line tub the boat looks as if it were pulling off with a prodi-gious great wed-ding cake to pre-sent to the whales Both ends of the line are ex-posed the low-er end ter-mi-nat-ing in an eye splice or loop com-ing up from the bot-tom again-st the side of the tub and hang-ing over its edge com-plete-ly dis-en-gaged from ev-ery-thing This ar-range-ment of the low-er end is nec-es-sary on two ac-coun-ts First In or-der to fa-cil-i-tate the fas-ten-ing to it of an ad-di-tion-al line from a neigh-bor-ing boat in case the strick-en whale should sound so deep as to threat-en to car-ry off the en-tire line orig-i-nal-ly at-tached to the har-poon In the-se in-stances the whale of course is shift-ed like a mug of ale as it were from the one boat to the oth-er though the first boat al-ways hov-ers at hand to as-sist its con-sort Se-cond This ar-range-ment is in-dis-pens-able for com-mon safe-ty s sake for were the low-er end of the line in any way at-tached to the boat and were the whale then to run the line out to the end al-most in a sin-gle smok-ing min-ute as he some-times does he would not stop there for the doomed boat would in-fal-li-bly be dragged down af-ter him in-to the pro-fun-di-ty of the sea and in that case no town crier would ev-er find her again Be-fore low-er-ing the boat for the chase the up-per end of the line is tak-en aft from the tub and pass-ing round the log-ger-head there is again car-ried for-ward the en-tire length of the boat rest-ing cross-wise up-on the loom or han-dle of ev-ery man s oar so that it jogs again-st his wrist in row-ing and al-so pass-ing be-tween the men as they al-ter-nate-ly sit at the op-po-site gun-wales to the lead-ed chocks or grooves in the ex-treme point-ed prow of the boat where a wood-en pin or skew-er the size of a com-mon quill pre-ven-ts it from slip-ping out From the chocks it hangs in a slight fes-toon over the bows and is then passed in-side the boat again and some ten or twen-ty fath-oms called box line be-ing coiled up-on the box in the bows it con-tin-ues its way to the gun-wale still a lit-tle fur-ther aft and is then at-tached to the short warp the rope which is im-me-di-ate-ly con-nect-ed with the har-poon but pre-vi-ous to that con-nex-ion the short warp goes through sundry mys-ti-fi-ca-tions too te-dious to de-tail Thus the whale line folds the whole boat in its com-pli-cat-ed coils twist-ing and writhing around it in al-most ev-ery di-rec-tion All the oars-men are in-volved in its per-ilous con-tor-tions so that to the timid eye of the lands-man they seem as In-di-an jug-glers with the dead-li-est snakes sportive-ly fes-toon-ing their lim-bs Nor can any son of mor-tal wom-an for the first time seat him-self amid those hempen in-tri-ca-cies and while strain-ing his ut-most at the oar be-think him that at any un-known in-stant the har-poon may be dart-ed and all the-se hor-ri-ble con-tor-tions be put in play like ringed light-nings he can-not be thus cir-cum-stanced with-out a shud-der that makes the very mar-row in his bones to quiv-er in him like a shak-en jel-ly Yet habit strange thing what can-not habit ac-com-plish  Gay-er sal-lies more mer-ry mirth bet-ter jokes and brighter repar-tees you nev-er heard over your ma-hogany than you will hear over the half inch white cedar of the whale boat when thus hung in hang-man s noos-es and like the six burghers of Calais be-fore King Ed-ward the six men com-pos-ing the crew pull in-to the jaws of death with a hal-ter around ev-ery neck as you may say Per-haps a very lit-tle thought will now en-able you to ac-count for those re-peat-ed whal-ing dis-as-ter-s some few of which are ca-su-al-ly chron-i-cled of this man or that man be-ing tak-en out of the boat by the line and lost For when the line is dart-ing out to be seat-ed then in the boat is like be-ing seat-ed in the mid-st of the man-i-fold whizzings of a steam en-gine in full play when ev-ery fly-ing beam and shaft and wheel is graz-ing you It is worse for you can-not sit mo-tion-less in the heart of the-se per-ils be-cause the boat is rock-ing like a cradle and you are pitched one way and the oth-er with-out the slight-est warn-ing and on-ly by a cer-tain self ad-just-ing buoy-an-cy and si-mul-ta-ne-ous-ness of vo-li-tion and ac-tion can you es-cape be-ing made a Mazep-pa of and run away with where the all see-ing sun him-self could nev-er pierce you out Again as the pro-found calm which on-ly ap-par-ent-ly pre-cedes and proph-e-sies of the storm is per-haps more aw-ful than the storm it-self for in-deed the calm is but the wrap-per and en-velope of the storm and con-tains it in it-self as the seem-ing-ly harm-less ri-fle holds the fa-tal pow-der and the ball and the ex-plo-sion so the grace-ful re-pose of the line as it silent-ly ser-pen-ti-nes about the oars-men be-fore be-ing brought in-to ac-tu-al play this is a thing which car-ries more of true ter-ror than any oth-er as-pect of this dan-ger-ous af-fair But why say more All men live en-veloped in whale lines All are born with hal-ters round their necks but it is on-ly when caught in the swift sud-den turn of death that mor-tals re-al-ize the silent sub-tle ev-er pre-sent per-ils of life And if you be a philoso-pher though seat-ed in the whale boat you would not at heart feel one whit more of ter-ror than though seat-ed be-fore your evening fire with a pok-er and not a har-poon by your side CHAPTER 61 Stubb Kil-ls a Whale If to Star-buck the ap-pari-tion of the Squid was a thing of por-ten-ts to Quee-queg it was quite a dif-fer-ent ob-ject  When you see him  quid  said the sav-age hon-ing his har-poon in the bow of his hoist-ed boat  then you quick see him  parm whale  The next day was ex-ceed-ing-ly still and sul-try and with noth-ing spe-cial to en-gage them the Pe-quod s crew could hard-ly re-sist the spell of sleep in-duced by such a va-cant sea For this part of the In-di-an Ocean through which we then were voy-ag-ing is not what whale-men call a live-ly ground that is it af-fords few-er glimpses of por-pois-es dol-phins fly-ing fish and oth-er vi-va-cious denizens of more stir-ring wa-ters than those off the Rio de la Plata or the in shore ground off Peru It was my turn to stand at the fore-mast head and with my shoul-ders lean-ing again-st the slack-ened roy-al shrouds to and fro I idly swayed in what seemed an en-chant-ed air No res-o-lu-tion could with-stand it in that dreamy mood los-ing all con-scious-ness at last my soul went out of my body though my body still con-tin-ued to sway as a pen-du-lum will long af-ter the pow-er which first moved it is with-drawn Ere for-get-ful-ness al-to-geth-er came over me I had no-ticed that the sea-men at the main and mizzen mast heads were al-ready drowsy So that at last all three of us life-less-ly swung from the spars and for ev-ery swing that we made there was a nod from be-low from the slum-ber-ing helms-man The waves too nod-ded their in-do-lent crests and across the wide trance of the sea east nod-ded to west and the sun over all Sud-den-ly bub-bles seemed burst-ing be-neath my closed eyes like vices my hands grasped the shrouds some in-vis-i-ble gra-cious agen-cy pre-served me with a shock I came back to life And lo close un-der our lee not forty fath-oms off a gi-gan-tic Sperm Whale lay rolling in the wa-ter like the cap-sized hull of a frigate his broad glossy back of an Ethiopi-an hue glis-ten-ing in the sun s rays like a mir-ror But lazi-ly un-du-lat-ing in the trough of the sea and ev-er and anon tran-quil-ly spout-ing his va-pory jet the whale looked like a port-ly burgher smok-ing his pipe of a warm af-ter-noon But that pipe poor whale was thy last As if struck by some en-chanter s wand the sleepy ship and ev-ery sleep-er in it all at on-ce start-ed in-to wake-ful-ness and more than a score of voic-es from all parts of the ves-sel si-mul-ta-ne-ous-ly with the three notes from aloft shout-ed forth the ac-cus-tomed cry as the great fish slow-ly and reg-u-lar-ly spout-ed the sparkling brine in-to the air  Clear away the boats Luff  cried Ahab And obey-ing his own or-der he dashed the helm down be-fore the helms-man could han-dle the spokes The sud-den ex-cla-ma-tions of the crew must have alarmed the whale and ere the boats were down ma-jes-ti-cal-ly turn-ing he swam away to the lee-ward but with such a steady tran-quil-li-ty and mak-ing so few rip-ples as he swam that think-ing af-ter all he might not as yet be alarmed Ahab gave or-ders that not an oar should be used and no man must speak but in whis-pers So seat-ed like On-tar-io In-di-ans on the gun-wales of the boats we swift-ly but silent-ly pad-dled along the calm not ad-mit-ting of the noise-less sails be-ing set Present-ly as we thus glid-ed in chase the mon-ster per-pen-dic-u-lar-ly flit-ted his tail forty feet in-to the air and then sank out of sight like a tow-er swal-lowed up  There go flukes  was the cry an an-nounce-ment im-me-di-ate-ly fol-lowed by Stub-b s pro-duc-ing his match and ig-nit-ing his pipe for now a respite was grant-ed After the full in-ter-val of his sound-ing had elapsed the whale rose again and be-ing now in ad-vance of the smok-er s boat and much nearer to it than to any of the oth-ers Stubb count-ed up-on the hon-or of the cap-ture It was ob-vi-ous now that the whale had at length be-come aware of his pur-suers All si-lence of cau-tious-ness was there-fore no longer of use Pad-dles were dropped and oars came loud-ly in-to play And still puff-ing at his pipe Stubb cheered on his crew to the as-sault Yes a mighty change had come over the fish All alive to his jeop-ardy he was go-ing  head out that part oblique-ly pro-ject-ing from the mad yeast which he brewed It will be seen in some oth-er place of what a very light sub-stance the en-tire in-te-ri-or of the sperm whale s enor-mous head con-sists Though ap-par-ent-ly the most mas-sive it is by far the most buoy-ant part about him So that with ease he el-e-vates it in the air and in-vari-ably does so when go-ing at his ut-most speed Be-sides such is the breadth of the up-per part of the front of his head and such the ta-per-ing cut wa-ter for-ma-tion of the low-er part that by oblique-ly el-e-vat-ing his head he there-by may be said to trans-form him-self from a bluff bowed slug-gish gal-liot in-to a sharp-point-ed New York pi-lot boat  Start her start her my men Don t hur-ry your-selves take plen-ty of time but start her start her like thun-der claps that s all  cried Stubb splut-ter-ing out the smoke as he spoke  Start her now give  em the long and strong stroke Tashte-go Start her Tash my boy start her all but keep cool keep cool cu-cum-bers is the word easy easy on-ly start her like grim death and grin-ning dev-ils and raise the buried dead per-pen-dic-u-lar out of their graves boys that s all Start her   Woo hoo Wa hee  screamed the Gay Head-er in re-ply rais-ing some old war whoop to the skies as ev-ery oars-man in the strained boat in-vol-un-tar-i-ly bounced for-ward with the one tremen-dous lead-ing stroke which the ea-ger In-di-an gave But his wild screams were an-swered by oth-ers quite as wild  Kee hee Kee hee  yelled Dag-goo strain-ing for-wards and back-wards on his seat like a pac-ing tiger in his cage  Ka la Koo loo  howled Quee-queg as if smack-ing his lips over a mouth-ful of Gre-nadier s steak And thus with oars and yel-ls the keels cut the sea Mean-while Stubb re-tain-ing his place in the van still en-cour-aged his men to the on-set all the while puff-ing the smoke from his mouth Like des-per-a-does they tugged and they strained till the wel-come cry was heard  Stand up Tashte-go  give it to him  The har-poon was hurled  Stern all  The oars-men backed wa-ter the same mo-ment some-thing went hot and hiss-ing along ev-ery one of their wrists It was the mag-i-cal line An in-stant be-fore Stubb had swift-ly caught two ad-di-tion-al turns with it round the log-ger-head whence by rea-son of its in-creased rapid cir-clings a hempen blue smoke now jet-ted up and min-gled with the steady fumes from his pipe As the line passed round and round the log-ger-head so al-so just be-fore reach-ing that point it blis-ter-ing-ly passed through and through both of Stub-b s hands from which the hand cloths or squares of quilt-ed can-vas some-times worn at the-se times had ac-ci-den-tal-ly dropped It was like hold-ing an en-e-my s sharp two edged sword by the blade and that en-e-my all the time striv-ing to wrest it out of your clutch  Wet the line wet the line  cried Stubb to the tub oars-man him seat-ed by the tub who snatch-ing off his hat dashed sea wa-ter in-to it More turns were tak-en so that the line be-gan hold-ing its place The boat now flew through the boil-ing wa-ter like a shark all fins Stubb and Tashte-go here changed places stem for stern a stag-ger-ing busi-ness tru-ly in that rock-ing com-mo-tion Part-ly to show the in-dis-pens-able-ness of this act it may here be stat-ed that in the old Dutch fish-ery a mop was used to dash the run-ning line with wa-ter in many oth-er ships a wood-en pig-gin or bail-er is set apart for that pur-pose Your hat how-ev-er is the most con-ve-nient From the vi-brat-ing line ex-tend-ing the en-tire length of the up-per part of the boat and from its now be-ing more tight than a harp-string you would have thought the craft had two keel-s one cleav-ing the wa-ter the oth-er the air as the boat churned on through both op-pos-ing el-e-men-ts at on-ce A con-tin-u-al cas-cade played at the bows a cease-less whirling ed-dy in her wake and at the slight-est mo-tion from with-in even but of a lit-tle fin-ger the vi-brat-ing crack-ing craft cant-ed over her spas-mod-ic gun-wale in-to the sea Thus they rushed each man with might and main cling-ing to his seat to pre-vent be-ing tossed to the foam and the tall form of Tashte-go at the steer-ing oar crouch-ing al-most dou-ble in or-der to bring down his cen-tre of grav-i-ty Whole At-lantics and Pacifics seemed passed as they shot on their way till at length the whale some-what slack-ened his flight  Haul in haul in  cried Stubb to the bows-man and fac-ing round to-wards the whale all hands be-gan pulling the boat up to him while yet the boat was be-ing towed on Soon rang-ing up by his flank Stubb firm-ly plant-ing his knee in the clum-sy cleat dart-ed dart af-ter dart in-to the fly-ing fish at the word of com-mand the boat al-ter-nate-ly stern-ing out of the way of the whale s hor-ri-ble wal-low and then rang-ing up for an-oth-er fling The red tide now poured from all sides of the mon-ster like brooks down a hill His tor-ment-ed body rolled not in brine but in blood which bub-bled and seethed for fur-longs be-hind in their wake The slant-ing sun play-ing up-on this crim-son pond in the sea sent back its re-flec-tion in-to ev-ery face so that they all glowed to each oth-er like red men And all the while jet af-ter jet of white smoke was ag-o-niz-ing-ly shot from the spir-a-cle of the whale and ve-he-ment puff af-ter puff from the mouth of the ex-cit-ed heads-man as at ev-ery dart haul-ing in up-on his crooked lance by the line at-tached to it Stubb straight-ened it again and again by a few rapid blows again-st the gun-wale then again and again sent it in-to the whale  Pull up pull up  he now cried to the bows-man as the wan-ing whale re-laxed in his wrath  Pull up  close to  and the boat ranged along the fish s flank When reach-ing far over the bow Stubb slow-ly churned his long sharp lance in-to the fish and kept it there care-ful-ly churn-ing and churn-ing as if cau-tious-ly seek-ing to feel af-ter some gold watch that the whale might have swal-lowed and which he was fear-ful of break-ing ere he could hook it out But that gold watch he sought was the in-ner-most life of the fish And now it is struck for start-ing from his trance in-to that un-speak-able thing called his  flur-ry  the mon-ster hor-ri-bly wal-lowed in his blood over-wrapped him-self in im-pen-e-tra-ble mad boil-ing spray so that the im-per-illed craft in-stant-ly drop-ping astern had much ado blind-ly to strug-gle out from that phren-sied twi-light in-to the clear air of the day And now abat-ing in his flur-ry the whale on-ce more rolled out in-to view surg-ing from side to side spas-mod-i-cal-ly di-lat-ing and con-tract-ing his spout hole with sharp crack-ing ag-o-nized res-pi-ra-tions At last gush af-ter gush of clot-ted red gore as if it had been the pur-ple lees of red wine shot in-to the fright-ed air and falling back again ran drip-ping down his mo-tion-less flanks in-to the sea His heart had burst  He s dead Mr Stubb  said Dag-goo  Yes both pipes smoked out  and with-draw-ing his own from his mouth Stubb scat-tered the dead ash-es over the wa-ter and for a mo-ment stood thought-ful-ly eye-ing the vast corpse he had made CHAPTER 62 The Dart A word con-cern-ing an in-ci-dent in the last chap-ter Ac-cord-ing to the in-vari-able us-age of the fish-ery the whale boat push-es off from the ship with the heads-man or whale killer as tem-po-rary steers-man and the har-pooneer or whale fas-ten-er pulling the fore-most oar the one known as the har-pooneer oar Now it needs a strong ner-vous arm to strike the first iron in-to the fish for of-ten in what is called a long dart the heavy im-ple-ment has to be flung to the dis-tance of twen-ty or thir-ty feet But how-ev-er pro-longed and ex-haust-ing the chase the har-pooneer is ex-pect-ed to pull his oar mean-while to the ut-ter-most in-deed he is ex-pect-ed to set an ex-am-ple of su-per-hu-man ac-tiv-i-ty to the rest not on-ly by in-cred-i-ble row-ing but by re-peat-ed loud and in-trepid ex-cla-ma-tions and what it is to keep shout-ing at the top of one s com-pass while all the oth-er mus-cles are strained and half start-ed what that is none know but those who have tried it For one I can-not bawl very hearti-ly and work very reck-less-ly at one and the same time In this strain-ing bawl-ing state then with his back to the fish all at on-ce the ex-haust-ed har-pooneer hears the ex-cit-ing cry  Stand up and give it to him  He now has to drop and se-cure his oar turn round on his cen-tre half way seize his har-poon from the crotch and with what lit-tle strength may re-main he es-says to pitch it some-how in-to the whale No won-der tak-ing the whole fleet of whale-men in a body that out of fifty fair chances for a dart not five are suc-cess-ful no won-der that so many hap-less har-pooneers are mad-ly cursed and dis-rat-ed no won-der that some of them ac-tu-al-ly burst their blood ves-sels in the boat no won-der that some sperm whale-men are ab-sent four years with four bar-rels no won-der that to many ship own-ers whal-ing is but a los-ing con-cern for it is the har-pooneer that makes the voy-age and if you take the breath out of his body how can you ex-pect to find it there when most want-ed Again if the dart be suc-cess-ful then at the sec-ond crit-i-cal in-stant that is when the whale starts to run the boat-head-er and har-pooneer like-wise start to run-ning fore and aft to the im-mi-nent jeop-ardy of them-selves and ev-ery one else It is then they change places and the heads-man the chief of-fi-cer of the lit-tle craft takes his prop-er sta-tion in the bows of the boat Now I care not who main-tains the con-trary but all this is both fool-ish and un-nec-es-sary The heads-man should stay in the bows from first to last he should both dart the har-poon and the lance and no row-ing what-ev-er should be ex-pect-ed of him ex-cept un-der cir-cum-stances ob-vi-ous to any fish-er-man I know that this would some-times in-volve a slight loss of speed in the chase but long ex-pe-ri-ence in var-i-ous whale-men of more than one na-tion has con-vinced me that in the vast ma-jor-i-ty of fail-ures in the fish-ery it has not by any means been so much the speed of the whale as the be-fore de-scribed ex-haus-tion of the har-pooneer that has caused them To in-sure the great-est ef-fi-cien-cy in the dart the har-pooneers of this world must start to their feet from out of idle-ness and not from out of toil CHAPTER 63 The Crotch Out of the trunk the branch-es grow out of them the twigs So in pro-duc-tive sub-jec-ts grow the chap-ters The crotch al-lud-ed to on a pre-vi-ous page de-serves in-de-pen-dent men-tion It is a notched stick of a pe-cu-liar form some two feet in length which is per-pen-dic-u-lar-ly in-sert-ed in-to the star-board gun-wale near the bow for the pur-pose of fur-nish-ing a rest for the wood-en ex-trem-i-ty of the har-poon whose oth-er naked barbed end slop-ing-ly pro-jec-ts from the prow There-by the weapon is in-stant-ly at hand to its hurler who snatch-es it up as read-i-ly from its rest as a back-woods-man swings his ri-fle from the wall It is cus-tom-ary to have two har-poons repos-ing in the crotch re-spec-tive-ly called the first and sec-ond irons But the-se two har-poons each by its own cord are both con-nect-ed with the line the ob-ject be-ing this to dart them both if pos-si-ble one in-stant-ly af-ter the oth-er in-to the same whale so that if in the com-ing drag one should draw out the oth-er may still re-tain a hold It is a dou-bling of the chances But it very of-ten hap-pens that ow-ing to the in-stan-ta-neous vi-o-lent con-vul-sive run-ning of the whale up-on re-ceiv-ing the first iron it be-comes im-pos-si-ble for the har-pooneer how-ev-er light-ning like in his move-men-ts to pitch the sec-ond iron in-to him Nev-er-the-less as the sec-ond iron is al-ready con-nect-ed with the line and the line is run-ning hence that weapon must at all even-ts be an-tic-i-pat-ing-ly tossed out of the boat some-how and some-where else the most ter-ri-ble jeop-ardy would in-volve all hands Tum-bled in-to the wa-ter it ac-cord-ing-ly is in such cas-es the spare coils of box line men-tioned in a pre-ced-ing chap-ter mak-ing this feat in most in-stances pru-dent-ly prac-ti-ca-ble But this crit-i-cal act is not al-ways unat-tend-ed with the sad-dest and most fa-tal ca-su-alties Fur-ther-more you must know that when the sec-ond iron is thrown over-board it thence-forth be-comes a dan-gling sharp edged ter-ror skit-tish-ly curvet-ting about both boat and whale en-tan-gling the lines or cut-ting them and mak-ing a prodi-gious sen-sa-tion in all di-rec-tions Nor in gen-er-al is it pos-si-ble to se-cure it again un-til the whale is fair-ly cap-tured and a corpse Con-sid-er now how it must be in the case of four boats all en-gag-ing one un-usu-al-ly strong ac-tive and know-ing whale when ow-ing to the-se qual-i-ties in him as well as to the thou-sand con-cur-ring ac-ci-den-ts of such an au-da-cious en-ter-prise eight or ten loose sec-ond irons may be si-mul-ta-ne-ous-ly dan-gling about him For of course each boat is sup-plied with sev-er-al har-poons to bend on to the line should the first one be in-ef-fec-tu-al-ly dart-ed with-out re-cov-ery All the-se par-tic-u-lars are faith-ful-ly nar-rat-ed here as they will not fail to elu-ci-date sev-er-al most im-por-tant how-ev-er in-tri-cate pas-sages in sce-nes here-after to be paint-ed CHAPTER 64 Stub-b s Sup-per Stub-b s whale had been killed some dis-tance from the ship It was a calm so form-ing a tandem of three boats we com-menced the slow busi-ness of tow-ing the tro-phy to the Pe-quod And now as we eigh-teen men with our thir-ty six ar-ms and one hun-dred and eighty thum-bs and fin-gers slow-ly toiled hour af-ter hour up-on that in-ert slug-gish corpse in the sea and it seemed hard-ly to budge at all ex-cept at long in-ter-vals good ev-i-dence was here-by fur-nished of the enor-mous-ness of the mass we moved For up-on the great canal of Hang Ho or what-ev-er they call it in Chi-na four or five la-bor-ers on the foot path will draw a bulky freight-ed junk at the rate of a mile an hour but this grand ar-gosy we towed heav-i-ly forged along as if laden with pig lead in bulk Dark-ness came on but three lights up and down in the Pe-quod s main rig-ging dim-ly guid-ed our way till draw-ing nearer we saw Ahab drop-ping one of sev-er-al more lanterns over the bul-warks Va-cant-ly eye-ing the heav-ing whale for a mo-ment he is-sued the usu-al or-ders for se-cur-ing it for the night and then hand-ing his lantern to a sea-man went his way in-to the cab-in and did not come for-ward again un-til morn-ing Though in over-see-ing the pur-suit of this whale Cap-tain Ahab had evinced his cus-tom-ary ac-tiv-i-ty to call it so yet now that the crea-ture was dead some vague dis-sat-is-fac-tion or im-pa-tience or de-spair seemed work-ing in him as if the sight of that dead body re-mind-ed him that Moby Dick was yet to be slain and though a thou-sand oth-er whales were brought to his ship all that would not one jot ad-vance his grand mono-ma-ni-ac ob-ject Very soon you would have thought from the sound on the Pe-quod s decks that all hands were prepar-ing to cast an-chor in the deep for heavy chains are be-ing dragged along the deck and thrust rat-tling out of the port holes But by those clank-ing links the vast corpse it-self not the ship is to be moored Tied by the head to the stern and by the tail to the bows the whale now lies with its black hull close to the ves-sel s and seen through the dark-ness of the night which ob-scured the spars and rig-ging aloft the two ship and whale seemed yoked to-geth-er like colos-sal bul-locks where-of one re-cli-nes while the oth-er re-mains stand-ing A lit-tle item may as well be re-lat-ed here The strongest and most re-li-able hold which the ship has up-on the whale when moored alongside is by the flukes or tail and as from its greater den-si-ty that part is rel-a-tive-ly heav-ier than any oth-er ex-cept-ing the side fins its flex-i-bil-i-ty even in death caus-es it to sink low be-neath the sur-face so that with the hand you can-not get at it from the boat in or-der to put the chain round it But this dif-fi-cul-ty is in-ge-nious-ly over-come a small strong line is pre-pared with a wood-en float at its out-er end and a weight in its mid-dle while the oth-er end is se-cured to the ship By adroit man-age-ment the wood-en float is made to rise on the oth-er side of the mass so that now hav-ing gir-dled the whale the chain is read-i-ly made to fol-low suit and be-ing slipped along the body is at last locked fast round the small-est part of the tail at the point of junc-tion with its broad flukes or lobes If moody Ahab was now all qui-es-cence at least so far as could be known on deck Stubb his sec-ond mate flushed with con-quest be-trayed an un-usu-al but still good na-tured ex-cite-ment Such an un-wont-ed bustle was he in that the staid Star-buck his of-fi-cial su-pe-ri-or qui-et-ly re-signed to him for the time the sole man-age-ment of af-fairs One small help-ing cause of all this live-li-ness in Stubb was soon made strange-ly man-i-fest Stubb was a high liv-er he was some-what in-tem-per-ate-ly fond of the whale as a fla-vor-ish thing to his palate  A steak a steak ere I sleep You Dag-goo over-board you go and cut me one from his small  Here be it known that though the-se wild fish-er-men do not as a gen-er-al thing and ac-cord-ing to the great mil-i-tary max-im make the en-e-my de-fray the cur-rent ex-pens-es of the war at least be-fore re-al-iz-ing the pro-ceeds of the voy-age yet now and then you find some of the-se Nan-tuck-eters who have a gen-uine rel-ish for that par-tic-u-lar part of the Sperm Whale des-ig-nat-ed by Stubb com-pris-ing the ta-per-ing ex-trem-i-ty of the body About mid-night that steak was cut and cooked and light-ed by two lanterns of sperm oil Stubb stout-ly stood up to his sper-ma-ceti sup-per at the cap-stan head as if that cap-stan were a side-board Nor was Stubb the on-ly ban-queter on whale s flesh that night Min-gling their mum-blings with his own mas-ti-ca-tions thou-sands on thou-sands of sharks swarm-ing round the dead leviathan smack-ing-ly feast-ed on its fat-ness The few sleep-ers be-low in their bunks were of-ten star-tled by the sharp slap-ping of their tails again-st the hull with-in a few inch-es of the sleep-er-s hearts Peer-ing over the side you could just see them as be-fore you heard them wal-low-ing in the sul-len black wa-ters and turn-ing over on their backs as they scooped out huge glob-u-lar pieces of the whale of the big-ness of a hu-man head This par-tic-u-lar feat of the shark seems all but mirac-u-lous How at such an ap-par-ent-ly unas-sail-able sur-face they con-trive to gouge out such sym-met-ri-cal mouth-fuls re-mains a part of the uni-ver-sal prob-lem of all things The mark they thus leave on the whale may best be likened to the hol-low made by a car-pen-ter in coun-ter-sink-ing for a screw Though amid all the smok-ing hor-ror and di-a-bolism of a sea fight sharks will be seen long-ing-ly gaz-ing up to the ship s decks like hun-gry dogs round a table where red meat is be-ing carved ready to bolt down ev-ery killed man that is tossed to them and though while the valiant butch-ers over the deck table are thus can-ni-bal-ly carv-ing each oth-er s live meat with carv-ing knives all gild-ed and tas-selled the sharks al-so with their jew-el hilt-ed mouths are quar-rel-some-ly carv-ing away un-der the table at the dead meat and though were you to turn the whole af-fair up-side down it would still be pret-ty much the same thing that is to say a shock-ing shark-ish busi-ness enough for all par-ties and though sharks al-so are the in-vari-able out-rid-ers of all slave ships cross-ing the At-lantic sys-tem-at-i-cal-ly trot-ting alongside to be handy in case a parcel is to be car-ried any-where or a dead slave to be de-cent-ly buried and though one or two oth-er like in-stances might be set down touch-ing the set ter-ms places and oc-ca-sions when sharks do most so-cial-ly con-gre-gate and most hi-lar-i-ous-ly feast yet is there no con-ceiv-able time or oc-ca-sion when you will find them in such count-less num-bers and in gay-er or more jovial spir-its than around a dead sperm whale moored by night to a whale-ship at sea If you have nev-er seen that sight then sus-pend your de-ci-sion about the pro-pri-ety of dev-il wor-ship and the ex-pe-di-en-cy of con-cil-i-at-ing the dev-il But as yet Stubb heed-ed not the mum-blings of the ban-quet that was go-ing on so nigh him no more than the sharks heed-ed the smack-ing of his own epi-cure-an lips  Cook cook  where s that old Fleece  he cried at length widen-ing his legs still fur-ther as if to form a more se-cure base for his sup-per and at the same time dart-ing his fork in-to the dish as if stab-bing with his lance  cook you cook  sail this way cook  The old black not in any very high glee at hav-ing been pre-vi-ous-ly roused from his warm ham-mock at a most un-sea-son-able hour came sham-bling along from his gal-ley for like many old blacks there was some-thing the mat-ter with his knee pans which he did not keep well scoured like his oth-er pans this old Fleece as they called him came shuf-fling and limp-ing along as-sist-ing his step with his tongs which af-ter a clum-sy fash-ion were made of straight-ened iron hoops this old Ebony floun-dered along and in obe-di-ence to the word of com-mand came to a dead stop on the op-po-site side of Stub-b s side-board when with both hands fold-ed be-fore him and rest-ing on his two legged cane he bowed his arched back still fur-ther over at the same time side-ways in-clin-ing his head so as to bring his best ear in-to play  Cook  said Stubb rapid-ly lift-ing a rather red-dish morsel to his mouth  don t you think this steak is rather over-done You ve been beat-ing this steak too much cook it s too ten-der Don t I al-ways say that to be good a whale steak must be tough There are those sharks now over the side don t

Blast me if I can hear my own voice Away cook and de-liv-er my mes-sage Here take this lantern  snatch-ing one from his side-board  now then go and preach to  em  Sul-len-ly tak-ing the of-fered lantern old Fleece limped across the deck to the bul-warks and then with one hand drop-ping his light low over the sea so as to get a good view of his con-gre-ga-tion with the oth-er hand he solemn-ly flour-ished his tongs and lean-ing far over the side in a mum-bling voice be-gan ad-dress-ing the sharks while Stubb soft-ly crawl-ing be-hind over-heard all that was said  Fel-low crit-ters I se

out your neigh-bour s mout I say Is not one shark dood right as toder to dat whale And by Gor none on you has de right to dat whale dat whale be-long to some one else I know some o you has berry brig mout brig-ger dan oders but den de brig mouts some-times has de small bel-lies so dat de brig-ness of de mout is not to swaller wid but to bit off de blub-ber for de small fry ob sharks dat can t get in-to de scrouge to help dem-selves   Well done old Fleece  cried Stubb  that s Chris-tian-i-ty go on   No use goin on de dam willains will keep a scoug-in and slap-pin each oder Mas-sa Stubb dey don t hear one word no use a preach-in to such dam g ut-tons as you call  em till dare bel-lies is full and dare bel-lies is bot-tom-less and when dey do get  em full dey wont hear you den for den dey sink in de sea go fast to sleep on de coral and can t hear not ing at all no more for eber and eber   Upon my soul I am about of the same opin-ion so give the bene-dic-tion Fleece and I ll away to my sup-per  Upon this Fleece hold-ing both hands over the fishy mob raised his shrill voice and cried  Cussed fel-low crit-ters Kick up de damn-dest row as ev-er you can fill your dam bel-lies  till dey bust and den die   Now cook  said Stubb re-sum-ing his sup-per at the cap-stan  stand just where you stood be-fore there over again-st me and pay par-tic-u-lar at-ten-tion   All den-tion  said Fleece again stoop-ing over up-on his tongs in the de-sired po-si-tion  Well  said Stubb help-ing him-self freely mean-while  I shall now go back to the sub-ject of this steak In the first place how old are you cook   What dat do wid de  teak  said the old black testi-ly  Si-lence How old are you cook    Bout nine-ty dey say  he gloomi-ly mut-tered  And you have lived in this world hard up-on one hun-dred years cook and don t know yet how to cook a whale steak  rapid-ly bolt-ing an-oth-er mouth-ful at the last word so that morsel seemed a con-tin-u-a-tion of the ques-tion  Where were you born cook    Hind de hatch-way in fer-ry boat goin ober de Roanoke   Born in a fer-ry boat That s queer too But I want to know what coun-try you were born in cook   Did-n t I say de Roanoke coun-try  he cried sharply  No you did-n t cook but I ll tell you what I m com-ing to cook You must go home and be born over again you don t know how to cook a whale steak yet   Bress my soul if I cook noder one  he growled an-gri-ly turn-ing round to de-part  Come back cook  here hand me those tongs  now take that bit of steak there and tell me if you think that steak cooked as it should be Take it I say  hold-ing the tongs to-wards him  take it and taste it  Faint-ly smack-ing his with-ered lips over it for a mo-ment the old ne-gro mut-tered  Best cooked  teak I eber taste joosy berry joosy   Cook  said Stubb squar-ing him-self on-ce more  do you be-long to the church   Passed one on-ce in Cape Down  said the old man sul-len-ly  And you have on-ce in your life passed a holy church in Cape Town where you doubtless over-heard a holy par-son ad-dress-ing his hear-ers as his beloved fel-low crea-tures have you cook And yet you come here and tell me such a dread-ful lie as you did just now eh  said Stubb  Where do you ex-pect to go to cook   Go to bed berry soon  he mum-bled half turn-ing as he spoke  Avast heave to I mean when you die cook It s an aw-ful ques-tion Now what s your an-swer   When dis old brack man dies  said the ne-gro slow-ly chang-ing his whole air and de-meanor  he his-self won t go nowhere but some bressed an-gel will come and fetch him   Fetch him How In a coach and four as they fetched Eli-jah And fetch him where   Up dere  said Fleece hold-ing his tongs straight over his head and keep-ing it there very solemn-ly  So then you ex-pect to go up in-to our main top do you cook when you are dead But don t you know the high-er you climb the cold-er it gets Main top eh   Did-n t say dat t all  said Fleece again in the sulks  You said up there did-n t you and now look your-self and see where your tongs are point-ing But per-haps you ex-pect to get in-to heav-en by crawl-ing through the lub-ber s hole cook but no no cook you don t get there ex-cept you go the reg-u-lar way round by the rig-ging It s a tick-lish busi-ness but must be done or else it s no go But none of us are in heav-en yet Drop your tongs cook and hear my or-ders Do ye hear Hold your hat in one hand and clap t oth-er a top of your heart when I m giv-ing my or-ders cook What that your heart there  that s your giz-zard Aloft aloft  that s it now you have it Hold it there now and pay at-ten-tion   All  den-tion  said the old black with both hands placed as de-sired vain-ly wrig-gling his griz-zled head as if to get both ears in front at one and the same time  Well then cook you see this whale steak of yours was so very bad that I have put it out of sight as soon as pos-si-ble you see that don t you Well for the fu-ture when you cook an-oth-er whale steak for my pri-vate table here the cap-stan I ll tell you what to do so as not to spoil it by over-do-ing Hold the steak in one hand and show a live coal to it with the oth-er that done dish it d ye hear And now to mor-row cook when we are cut-ting in the fish be sure you stand by to get the tips of his fins have them put in pick-le As for the ends of the flukes have them soused cook There now ye may go  But Fleece had hard-ly got three paces off when he was re-called  Cook give me cut-lets for sup-per to mor-row night in the mid watch D ye hear away you sail then  Hal-loa stop make a bow be-fore you go  Avast heav-ing again Whale bal-ls for break-fast don t for-get   Wish by gor whale eat him  stead of him eat whale I m bressed if he ain t more of shark dan Mas-sa Shark his-self  mut-tered the old man limp-ing away with which sage ejac-u-la-tion he went to his ham-mock CHAPTER 65 The Whale as a Dish That mor-tal man should feed up-on the crea-ture that feeds his lamp and like Stubb eat him by his own light as you may say this seems so out-landish a thing that one must needs go a lit-tle in-to the his-to-ry and phi-los-o-phy of it It is up-on record that three cen-turies ago the tongue of the Right Whale was es-teemed a great del-i-ca-cy in France and com-mand-ed large prices there Al-so that in Hen-ry VIIIth s time a cer-tain cook of the court ob-tained a hand-some re-ward for in-vent-ing an ad-mirable sauce to be eat-en with bar-bacued por-pois-es which you re-mem-ber are a species of whale Por-pois-es in-deed are to this day con-sid-ered fine eat-ing The meat is made in-to bal-ls about the size of bil-liard bal-ls and be-ing well sea-soned and spiced might be tak-en for turtle bal-ls or veal bal-ls The old monks of Dun-fermline were very fond of them They had a great por-poise grant from the crown The fact is that among his hunters at least the whale would by all hands be con-sid-ered a no-ble dish were there not so much of him but when you come to sit down be-fore a meat pie near-ly one hun-dred feet long it takes away your ap-petite On-ly the most un-prej-u-diced of men like Stubb nowa-days par-take of cooked whales but the Esquimaux are not so fas-tid-i-ous We all know how they live up-on whales and have rare old vin-tages of prime old train oil Zo-granda one of their most fa-mous doc-tors rec-om-mends strips of blub-ber for in-fan-ts as be-ing ex-ceed-ing-ly juicy and nour-ish-ing And this re-minds me that cer-tain English-men who long ago were ac-ci-den-tal-ly left in Green-land by a whal-ing ves-sel that the-se men ac-tu-al-ly lived for sev-er-al months on the mouldy scraps of whales which had been left ashore af-ter try-ing out the blub-ber Among the Dutch whale-men the-se scraps are called  frit-ter-s which in-deed they great-ly re-sem-ble be-ing brown and crisp and smelling some-thing like old Am-s-ter-dam house-wives dough nuts or oly cooks when fresh They have such an eat-able look that the most self deny-ing stranger can hard-ly keep his hands off But what fur-ther de-pre-ci-ates the whale as a civ-i-lized dish is his ex-ceed-ing rich-ness He is the great prize ox of the sea too fat to be del-i-cate-ly good Look at his hump which would be as fine eat-ing as the buf-falo s which is es-teemed a rare dish were it not such a solid pyra-mid of fat But the sper-ma-ceti it-self how bland and creamy that is like the trans-par-ent half jel-lied white meat of a co-coanut in the third mon-th of its growth yet far too rich to sup-ply a sub-sti-tute for but-ter Nev-er-the-less many whale-men have a method of ab-sorbing it in-to some oth-er sub-stance and then par-tak-ing of it In the long try watch-es of the night it is a com-mon thing for the sea-men to dip their ship bis-cuit in-to the huge oil pots and let them fry there awhile Many a good sup-per have I thus made In the case of a small Sperm Whale the brains are ac-count-ed a fine dish The cas-ket of the skull is bro-ken in-to with an axe and the two plump whitish lobes be-ing with-drawn pre-cise-ly re-sem-bling two large pud-dings they are then mixed with flour and cooked in-to a most delectable mess in fla-vor some-what re-sem-bling calves head which is quite a dish among some epi-cures and ev-ery one knows that some young bucks among the epi-cures by con-tin-u-al-ly din-ing up-on calves brains by and by get to have a lit-tle brains of their own so as to be able to tell a calf s head from their own heads which in-deed re-quires un-com-mon dis-crim-i-na-tion And that is the rea-son why a young buck with an in-tel-li-gent look-ing calf s head be-fore him is some-how one of the sad-dest sights you can see The head looks a sort of re-proach-ful-ly at him with an  Et tu Brute  ex-pres-sion It is not per-haps en-tire-ly be-cause the whale is so ex-ces-sive-ly unc-tu-ous that lands-men seem to re-gard the eat-ing of him with ab-hor-rence that ap-pears to re-sult in some way from the con-sid-er-a-tion be-fore men-tioned i e that a man should eat a new-ly mur-dered thing of the sea and eat it too by its own light But no doubt the first man that ev-er mur-dered an ox was re-gard-ed as a mur-derer per-haps he was hung and if he had been put on his tri-al by ox-en he cer-tain-ly would have been and he cer-tain-ly de-served it if any mur-derer does Go to the meat mar-ket of a Satur-day night and see the crowds of live bipeds star-ing up at the long rows of dead quadrupeds Does not that sight take a tooth out of the can-ni-bal s jaw Can-ni-bals who is not a can-ni-bal I tell you it will be more tol-er-a-ble for the Fe-jee that salt-ed down a lean mis-sion-ary in his cel-lar again-st a com-ing famine it will be more tol-er-a-ble for that prov-i-dent Fe-jee I say in the day of judg-ment than for thee civ-i-lized and en-light-ened gour-mand who nailest geese to the ground and feast-est on their bloat-ed liv-ers in thy pat de foie gras But Stubb he eats the whale by its own light does he and that is adding in-sult to in-jury is it Look at your knife han-dle there my civ-i-lized and en-light-ened gour-mand din-ing off that roast beef what is that han-dle made of  what but the bones of the broth-er of the very ox you are eat-ing And what do you pick your teeth with af-ter de-vour-ing that fat goose With a feath-er of the same fowl And with what quill did the Sec-re-tary of the So-ci-ety for the Sup-pres-sion of Cru-el-ty to Gan-ders for-mal-ly in-dite his cir-cu-lars It is on-ly with-in the last mon-th or two that that so-ci-ety passed a res-o-lu-tion to pa-tron-ize noth-ing but steel pens CHAPTER 66 The Shark Mas-sacre When in the South-ern Fish-ery a cap-tured Sperm Whale af-ter long and weary toil is brought alongside late at night it is not as a gen-er-al thing at least cus-tom-ary to pro-ceed at on-ce to the busi-ness of cut-ting him in For that busi-ness is an ex-ceed-ing-ly la-bo-ri-ous one is not very soon com-plet-ed and re-quires all hands to set about it There-fore the com-mon us-age is to take in all sail lash the helm a lee and then send ev-ery one be-low to his ham-mock till day-light with the reser-va-tion that un-til that time an-chor watch-es shall be kept that is two and two for an hour each cou-ple the crew in ro-ta-tion shall mount the deck to see that all goes well But some-times es-pe-cial-ly up-on the Line in the Paci-fic this plan will not an-swer at all be-cause such in-cal-cu-la-ble hosts of sharks gath-er round the moored car-case that were he left so for six hours say on a stretch lit-tle more than the skele-ton would be vis-i-ble by morn-ing In most oth-er parts of the ocean how-ev-er where the-se fish do not so large-ly abound their won-drous vo-rac-i-ty can be at times con-sid-er-ably di-min-ished by vig-or-ous-ly stir-ring them up with sharp whal-ing spades a pro-ce-dure notwith-stand-ing which in some in-stances on-ly seems to tick-le them in-to still greater ac-tiv-i-ty But it was not thus in the pre-sent case with the Pe-quod s sharks though to be sure any man un-ac-cus-tomed to such sights to have looked over her side that night would have al-most thought the whole round sea was one huge cheese and those sharks the mag-gots in it Nev-er-the-less up-on Stubb set-ting the an-chor watch af-ter his sup-per was con-clud-ed and when ac-cord-ing-ly Quee-queg and a fore-castle sea-man came on deck no small ex-cite-ment was cre-at-ed among the sharks for im-me-di-ate-ly sus-pend-ing the cut-ting stages over the side and low-er-ing three lanterns so that they cast long gleams of light over the tur-bid sea the-se two mariners dart-ing their long whal-ing spades kept up an in-ces-sant mur-der-ing of the sharks by strik-ing the keen steel deep in-to their skul-ls seem-ing-ly their on-ly vi-tal part But in the foamy con-fu-sion of their mixed and strug-gling hosts the marks-men could not al-ways hit their mark and this brought about new rev-e-la-tions of the in-cred-i-ble fe-roc-i-ty of the foe They vi-cious-ly snapped not on-ly at each oth-er s dis-em-bow-el-men-ts but like flex-i-ble bows bent round and bit their own till those en-trails seemed swal-lowed over and over again by the same mouth to be op-po-site-ly void-ed by the gap-ing wound Nor was this all It was un-safe to med-dle with the corpses and ghosts of the-se crea-tures A sort of gener-ic or Pan-the-is-tic vi-tal-i-ty seemed to lurk in their very join-ts and bones af-ter what might be called the in-di-vid-u-al life had de-part-ed Killed and hoist-ed on deck for the sake of his skin one of the-se sharks al-most took poor Quee-queg s hand off when he tried to shut down the dead lid of his mur-der-ous jaw The whal-ing spade used for cut-ting in is made of the very best steel is about the big-ness of a man s spread hand and in gen-er-al shape cor-re-sponds to the gar-den im-ple-ment af-ter which it is named on-ly its sides are per-fect-ly flat and its up-per end con-sid-er-ably nar-row-er than the low-er This weapon is al-ways kept as sharp as pos-si-ble and when be-ing used is oc-ca-sion-al-ly honed just like a ra-zor In its sock-et a stiff pole from twen-ty to thir-ty feet long is in-sert-ed for a han-dle  Quee-queg no care what god made him shark  said the sav-age ag-o-niz-ing-ly lift-ing his hand up and down  wed-der Fe-jee god or Nan-tuck-et god but de god wat made shark must be one dam Ing-in  CHAPTER 67 Cut-ting In It was a Satur-day night and such a Sab-bath as fol-lowed Ex of-fi-cio pro-fes-sors of Sab-bath break-ing are all whale-men The ivory Pe-quod was turned in-to what seemed a sham-ble ev-ery sailor a butcher You would have thought we were of-fer-ing up ten thou-sand red ox-en to the sea gods In the first place the enor-mous cut-ting tack-les among oth-er pon-der-ous things com-pris-ing a clus-ter of blocks gen-er-al-ly paint-ed green and which no sin-gle man can pos-si-bly lift this vast bunch of grapes was swayed up to the main top and firm-ly lashed to the low-er mast head the strongest point any-where above a ship s deck The end of the hawser like rope wind-ing through the-se in-tri-ca-cies was then con-duct-ed to the wind-lass and the huge low-er block of the tack-les was swung over the whale to this block the great blub-ber hook weigh-ing some one hun-dred pounds was at-tached And now sus-pend-ed in stages over the side Star-buck and Stubb the mates armed with their long spades be-gan cut-ting a hole in the body for the in-ser-tion of the hook just above the near-est of the two side fins This done a broad semi-cir-cu-lar line is cut round the hole the hook is in-sert-ed and the main body of the crew strik-ing up a wild cho-rus now com-mence heav-ing in one dense crowd at the wind-lass When in-stant-ly the en-tire ship ca-reens over on her side ev-ery bolt in her starts like the nail heads of an old house in frosty weath-er she trem-bles quiv-ers and nods her fright-ed mast heads to the sky More and more she leans over to the whale while ev-ery gasp-ing heave of the wind-lass is an-swered by a help-ing heave from the bil-lows till at last a swift startling snap is heard with a great swash the ship rol-ls up-wards and back-wards from the whale and the tri-umphant tack-le ris-es in-to sight drag-ging af-ter it the dis-en-gaged semi-cir-cu-lar end of the first strip of blub-ber Now as the blub-ber en-velopes the whale pre-cise-ly as the rind does an or-ange so is it stripped off from the body pre-cise-ly as an or-ange is some-times stripped by spi-ral-iz-ing it For the strain con-stant-ly kept up by the wind-lass con-tin-u-al-ly keeps the whale rolling over and over in the wa-ter and as the blub-ber in one strip uni-form-ly peels off along the line called the  scarf  si-mul-ta-ne-ous-ly cut by the spades of Star-buck and Stubb the mates and just as fast as it is thus peeled off and in-deed by that very act it-self it is all the time be-ing hoist-ed high-er and high-er aloft till its up-per end grazes the main top the men at the wind-lass then cease heav-ing and for a mo-ment or two the prodi-gious blood drip-ping mass sways to and fro as if let down from the sky and ev-ery one pre-sent must take good heed to dodge it when it swings else it may box his ears and pitch him head-long over-board One of the at-tend-ing har-pooneers now ad-vances with a long keen weapon called a board-ing sword and watch-ing his chance he dex-ter-ous-ly slices out a con-sid-er-able hole in the low-er part of the sway-ing mass In-to this hole the end of the sec-ond al-ter-nat-ing great tack-le is then hooked so as to re-tain a hold up-on the blub-ber in or-der to pre-pare for what fol-lows Where-upon this ac-com-plished swords-man warn-ing all hands to stand off on-ce more makes a sci-en-tific dash at the mass and with a few side-long des-per-ate lung-ing slic-ings sev-ers it com-plete-ly in twain so that while the short low-er part is still fast the long up-per strip called a blan-ket piece swings clear and is all ready for low-er-ing The heavers for-ward now re-sume their song and while the one tack-le is peel-ing and hoist-ing a sec-ond strip from the whale the oth-er is slow-ly slack-ened away and down goes the first strip through the main hatch-way right be-neath in-to an un-fur-nished par-lor called the blub-ber room In-to this twi-light apart-ment sundry nim-ble hands keep coil-ing away the long blan-ket piece as if it were a great live mass of plait-ed ser-pen-ts And thus the work pro-ceeds the two tack-les hoist-ing and low-er-ing si-mul-ta-ne-ous-ly both whale and wind-lass heav-ing the heavers singing the blub-ber room gen-tle-men coil-ing the mates scarf-ing the ship strain-ing and all hands swear-ing oc-ca-sion-al-ly by way of as-suag-ing the gen-er-al fric-tion CHAPTER 68 The Blan-ket I have given no small at-ten-tion to that not un-vexed sub-ject the skin of the whale I have had con-tro-ver-sies about it with ex-pe-ri-enced whale-men afloat and learned nat-u-ral-ists ashore My orig-i-nal opin-ion re-mains un-changed but it is on-ly an opin-ion The ques-tion is what and where is the skin of the whale Al-ready you know what his blub-ber is That blub-ber is some-thing of the con-sis-tence of firm close grained beef but tougher more elas-tic and com-pact and ranges from eight or ten to twelve and fif-teen inch-es in thick-ness Now how-ev-er pre-pos-ter-ous it may at first seem to talk of any crea-ture s skin as be-ing of that sort of con-sis-tence and thick-ness yet in point of fact the-se are no ar-gu-men-ts again-st such a pre-sump-tion be-cause you can-not raise any oth-er dense en-velop-ing lay-er from the whale s body but that same blub-ber and the out-er-most en-velop-ing lay-er of any an-i-mal if rea-son-ably dense what can that be but the skin True from the un-marred dead body of the whale you may scrape off with your hand an in-finite-ly thin trans-par-ent sub-stance some-what re-sem-bling the thinnest shreds of isin-glass on-ly it is al-most as flex-i-ble and soft as sat-in that is pre-vi-ous to be-ing dried when it not on-ly con-trac-ts and thick-ens but be-comes rather hard and brit-tle I have sev-er-al such dried bits which I use for marks in my whale books It is trans-par-ent as I said be-fore and be-ing laid up-on the print-ed page I have some-times pleased my-self with fan-cy-ing it ex-ert-ed a mag-ni-fy-ing in-flu-ence At any rate it is pleas-ant to read about whales through their own spec-ta-cles as you may say But what I am driv-ing at here is this That same in-finite-ly thin isin-glass sub-stance which I ad-mit in-vests the en-tire body of the whale is not so much to be re-gard-ed as the skin of the crea-ture as the skin of the skin so to speak for it were sim-ply ridicu-lous to say that the prop-er skin of the tremen-dous whale is thin-ner and more ten-der than the skin of a new born child But no more of this As-sum-ing the blub-ber to be the skin of the whale then when this skin as in the case of a very large Sperm Whale will yield the bulk of one hun-dred bar-rels of oil and when it is con-sid-ered that in quan-ti-ty or rather weight that oil in its ex-pressed state is on-ly three fourths and not the en-tire sub-stance of the coat some idea may hence be had of the enor-mous-ness of that an-i-mat-ed mass a mere part of whose mere in-tegu-ment yields such a lake of liq-uid as that Reck-on-ing ten bar-rels to the ton you have ten tons for the net weight of on-ly three quar-ters of the stuff of the whale s skin In life the vis-i-ble sur-face of the Sperm Whale is not the least among the many mar-vels he pre-sen-ts Al-most in-vari-ably it is all over oblique-ly crossed and re crossed with num-ber-less straight marks in thick ar-ray some-thing like those in the finest Ital-ian line en-grav-ings But the-se marks do not seem to be im-pressed up-on the isin-glass sub-stance above men-tioned but seem to be seen through it as if they were en-graved up-on the body it-self Nor is this all In some in-stances to the quick ob-ser-vant eye those lin-ear marks as in a ver-i-ta-ble en-grav-ing but af-ford the ground for far oth-er de-lin-eations Th-e-se are hi-ero-glyph-i-cal that is if you call those mys-te-ri-ous cyphers on the wal-ls of pyra-mids hi-ero-glyph-ics then that is the prop-er word to use in the pre-sent con-nex-ion By my re-ten-tive mem-o-ry of the hi-ero-glyph-ics up-on one Sperm Whale in par-tic-u-lar I was much struck with a plate rep-re-sent-ing the old In-di-an char-ac-ters chis-elled on the fa-mous hi-ero-glyph-ic pal-isades on the banks of the Up-per Mis-sis-sip-pi Like those mys-tic rocks too the mys-tic marked whale re-mains un-de-ci-pher-able This al-lu-sion to the In-di-an rocks re-minds me of an-oth-er thing Be-sides all the oth-er phe-nom-e-na which the ex-te-ri-or of the Sperm Whale pre-sen-ts he not sel-dom dis-plays the back and more es-pe-cial-ly his flanks ef-faced in great part of the reg-u-lar lin-ear ap-pear-ance by rea-son of nu-mer-ous rude scratch-es al-to-geth-er of an ir-reg-u-lar ran-dom as-pect I should say that those New Eng-land rocks on the sea coast which Agas-siz imag-i-nes to bear the marks of vi-o-lent scrap-ing con-tact with vast float-ing ice-bergs I should say that those rocks must not a lit-tle re-sem-ble the Sperm Whale in this par-tic-u-lar It al-so seems to me that such scratch-es in the whale are prob-a-bly made by hos-tile con-tact with oth-er whales for I have most re-marked them in the large full grown bul-ls of the species A word or two more con-cern-ing this mat-ter of the skin or blub-ber of the whale It has al-ready been said that it is stript from him in long pieces called blan-ket pieces Like most sea ter-ms this one is very hap-py and sig-nif-i-cant For the whale is in-deed wrapt up in his blub-ber as in a re-al blan-ket or coun-ter-pane or still bet-ter an In-di-an poncho slipt over his head and skirt-ing his ex-trem-i-ty It is by rea-son of this cosy blan-ket-ing of his body that the whale is en-abled to keep him-self com-fort-able in all weath-ers in all seas times and tides What would be-come of a Green-land whale say in those shud-der-ing icy seas of the North if un-sup-plied with his cosy surtout True oth-er fish are found ex-ceed-ing-ly brisk in those Hyper-bore-an wa-ters but the-se be it ob-served are your cold blood-ed lun-g-less fish whose very bel-lies are re-frig-er-a-tors crea-tures that warm them-selves un-der the lee of an ice-berg as a trav-eller in win-ter would bask be-fore an inn fire where-as like man the whale has lungs and warm blood Freeze his blood and he dies How won-der-ful is it then ex-cept af-ter ex-pla-na-tion that this great mon-ster to whom cor-po-re-al warmth is as in-dis-pens-able as it is to man how won-der-ful that he should be found at home im-mersed to his lips for life in those Arc-tic wa-ters where when sea-men fall over-board they are some-times found months af-ter-wards per-pen-dic-u-lar-ly frozen in-to the hearts of fields of ice as a fly is found glued in am-ber But more sur-pris-ing is it to know as has been proved by ex-per-i-ment that the blood of a Po-lar whale is warmer than that of a Bor-neo ne-gro in sum-mer It does seem to me that here-in we see the rare virtue of a strong in-di-vid-u-al vi-tal-i-ty and the rare virtue of thick wal-ls and the rare virtue of in-te-ri-or spa-cious-ness Oh man ad-mire and mod-el thy-self af-ter the whale Do thou too re-main warm among ice Do thou too live in this world with-out be-ing of it Be cool at the equa-tor keep thy blood flu-id at the Pole Like the great dome of St Peter s and like the great whale re-tain O man in all sea-sons a tem-per-a-ture of thine own But how easy and how hope-less to teach the-se fine things Of erec-tions how few are domed like St Peter s of crea-tures how few vast as the whale CHAPTER 69 The Funer-al  Haul in the chains Let the car-case go astern  The vast tack-les have now done their du-ty The peeled white body of the be-head-ed whale flash-es like a mar-ble sepul-chre though changed in hue it has not per-cep-ti-bly lost any-thing in bulk It is still colos-sal Slow-ly it floats more and more away the wa-ter round it torn and splashed by the in-sa-tiate sharks and the air above vexed with ra-pa-cious flights of scream-ing fowls whose beaks are like so many in-sult-ing poniards in the whale The vast white headless phan-tom floats fur-ther and fur-ther from the ship and ev-ery rod that it so floats what seem square roods of sharks and cu-bic roods of fowls aug-ment the mur-der-ous din For hours and hours from the al-most sta-tion-ary ship that hideous sight is seen Be-neath the un-cloud-ed and mild azure sky up-on the fair face of the pleas-ant sea waft-ed by the joy-ous breezes that great mass of death floats on and on till lost in in-finite per-spec-tives There s a most dole-ful and most mock-ing fu-ner-al The sea vul-tures all in pi-ous mourn-ing the air sharks all punc-til-ious-ly in black or speck-led In life but few of them would have helped the whale I ween if per-ad-ven-ture he had need-ed it but up-on the ban-quet of his fu-ner-al they most pi-ous-ly do pounce Oh hor-ri-ble vul-tureism of earth from which not the might-i-est whale is free Nor is this the end Des-e-crat-ed as the body is a venge-ful ghost sur-vives and hov-ers over it to scare Espied by some timid man of war or blun-der-ing dis-cov-ery ves-sel from afar when the dis-tance ob-scur-ing the swarm-ing fowls nev-er-the-less still shows the white mass float-ing in the sun and the white spray heav-ing high again-st it straight-way the whale s un-harm-ing corpse with trem-bling fin-gers is set down in the log shoals rocks and break-ers here-abouts be-ware And for years af-ter-wards per-haps ships shun the place leap-ing over it as sil-ly sheep leap over a vac-u-um be-cause their lead-er orig-i-nal-ly leaped there when a stick was held There s your law of prece-den-ts there s your util-i-ty of tra-di-tions there s the sto-ry of your ob-sti-nate sur-vival of old be-liefs nev-er bot-tomed on the earth and now not even hov-er-ing in the air There s or-tho-doxy Thus while in life the great whale s body may have been a re-al ter-ror to his foes in his death his ghost be-comes a pow-er-less pan-ic to a world Are you a be-liev-er in ghosts my friend There are oth-er ghosts than the Cock Lane one and far deep-er men than Doc-tor John-son who be-lieve in them CHAPTER 7 The Sph-ynx It should not have been omit-ted that pre-vi-ous to com-plete-ly strip-ping the body of the leviathan he was be-head-ed Now the be-head-ing of the Sperm Whale is a sci-en-tific anatom-i-cal feat up-on which ex-pe-ri-enced whale sur-geons very much pride them-selves and not with-out rea-son Con-sid-er that the whale has noth-ing that can prop-er-ly be called a neck on the con-trary where his head and body seem to join there in that very place is the thick-est part of him Re-mem-ber al-so that the sur-geon must op-er-ate from above some eight or ten feet in-ter-ven-ing be-tween him and his sub-ject and that sub-ject al-most hid-den in a dis-coloured rolling and of-ten-times tu-mul-tuous and burst-ing sea Bear in mind too that un-der the-se un-to-ward cir-cum-stances he has to cut many feet deep in the flesh and in that sub-ter-ra-ne-ous man-ner with-out so much as get-ting one sin-gle peep in-to the ev-er con-tract-ing gash thus made he must skil-ful-ly steer clear of all ad-ja-cent in-ter-dict-ed parts and ex-act-ly di-vide the spine at a crit-i-cal point hard by its in-ser-tion in-to the skull Do you not mar-vel then at Stub-b s boast that he de-mand-ed but ten min-utes to be-head a sperm whale When first sev-ered the head is dropped astern and held there by a ca-ble till the body is stripped That done if it be-long to a small whale it is hoist-ed on deck to be de-lib-er-ate-ly dis-posed of But with a full grown leviathan this is im-pos-si-ble for the sperm whale s head em-braces near-ly one third of his en-tire bulk and com-plete-ly to sus-pend such a bur-den as that even by the im-mense tack-les of a whaler this were as vain a thing as to at-tempt weigh-ing a Dutch barn in jew-eller-s scales The Pe-quod s whale be-ing de-cap-i-tat-ed and the body stripped the head was hoist-ed again-st the ship s side about half way out of the sea so that it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its na-tive el-e-ment And there with the strained craft steeply lean-ing over to it by rea-son of the enor-mous down-ward drag from the low-er mast head and ev-ery yard arm on that side pro-ject-ing like a crane over the waves there that blood drip-ping head hung to the Pe-quod s waist like the gi-ant Holofer-nes s from the girdle of Ju-dith When this last task was ac-com-plished it was noon and the sea-men went be-low to their din-ner Si-lence reigned over the be-fore tu-mul-tuous but now de-sert-ed deck An in-tense cop-per calm like a uni-ver-sal yel-low lo-tus was more and more un-fold-ing its noise-less mea-sure-less leaves up-on the sea A short space elapsed and up in-to this noise-less-ness came Ahab alone from his cab-in Tak-ing a few turns on the quar-ter deck he paused to gaze over the side then slow-ly get-ting in-to the main chains he took Stub-b s long spade still re-main-ing there af-ter the whale s de-cap-i-ta-tion and strik-ing it in-to the low-er part of the half sus-pend-ed mass placed its oth-er end crutch wise un-der one arm and so stood lean-ing over with eyes at-ten-tive-ly fixed on this head It was a black and hood-ed head and hang-ing there in the mid-st of so in-tense a calm it seemed the Sph-ynx s in the de-sert  Speak thou vast and ven-er-a-ble head  mut-tered Ahab  which though un-gar-nished with a beard yet here and there lookest hoary with moss-es speak mighty head and tell us the se-cret thing that is in thee Of all di-vers thou hast dived the deep-est That head up-on which the up-per sun now gleams has moved amid this world s foun-da-tions Where un-record-ed names and navies rust and un-told hopes and an-chors rot where in her mur-der-ous hold this frigate earth is bal-last-ed with bones of mil-lions of the drowned there in that aw-ful wa-ter land there was thy most fa-mil-iar home Thou hast been where bell or di-ver nev-er went hast slept by many a sailor s side where sleep-less moth-ers would give their lives to lay them down Thou saw st the locked lovers when leap-ing from their flam-ing ship heart to heart they sank be-neath the ex-ult-ing wave true to each oth-er when heav-en seemed false to them Thou saw st the mur-dered mate when tossed by pi-rates from the mid-night deck for hours he fell in-to the deep-er mid-night of the in-sa-tiate maw and his mur-der-ers still sailed on un-harmed while swift light-nings shiv-ered the neigh-bor-ing ship that would have borne a righ-teous hus-band to out-stretched long-ing ar-ms O head thou hast seen enough to split the plan-ets and make an in-fi-del of Abra-ham and not one syl-la-ble is thine   Sail ho  cried a tri-umphant voice from the main mast head  Aye Well now that s cheer-ing  cried Ahab sud-den-ly erect-ing him-self while whole thun-der clouds swept aside from his brow  That live-ly cry up-on this dead-ly calm might al-most con-vert a bet-ter man  Where away   Three points on the star-board bow sir and bring-ing down her breeze to us  Bet-ter and bet-ter man Would now St Paul would come along that way and to my breeze-less-ness bring his breeze O Na-ture and O soul of man how far be-yond all ut-ter-ance are your linked analo-gies not the small-est atom stirs or lives on mat-ter but has its cun-ning du-pli-cate in mind  CHAPTER 71 The Jer-oboam s Sto-ry Hand in hand ship and breeze blew on but the breeze came faster than the ship and soon the Pe-quod be-gan to rock By and by through the glass the stranger s boats and manned mast heads proved her a whale ship But as she was so far to wind-ward and shoot-ing by ap-par-ent-ly mak-ing a pas-sage to some oth-er ground the Pe-quod could not hope to reach her So the sig-nal was set to see what re-spon-se would be made Here be it said that like the ves-sels of mil-i-tary mari-nes the ships of the Amer-i-can Whale Fleet have each a pri-vate sig-nal all which sig-nals be-ing col-lect-ed in a book with the names of the re-spec-tive ves-sels at-tached ev-ery cap-tain is pro-vid-ed with it There-by the whale com-man-ders are en-abled to recog-nise each oth-er up-on the ocean even at con-sid-er-able dis-tances and with no small fa-cil-i-ty The Pe-quod s sig-nal was at last re-spond-ed to by the stranger s set-ting her own which proved the ship to be the Jer-oboam of Nan-tuck-et Squar-ing her yards she bore down ranged abeam un-der the Pe-quod s lee and low-ered a boat it soon drew nigh but as the side lad-der was be-ing rigged by Star-buck s or-der to ac-com-mo-date the vis-it-ing cap-tain the stranger in ques-tion waved his hand from his boat s stern in to-ken of that pro-ceed-ing be-ing en-tire-ly un-nec-es-sary It turned out that the Jer-oboam had a ma-lig-nant epi-demic on board and that May-hew her cap-tain was fear-ful of in-fect-ing the Pe-quod s com-pa-ny For though him-self and boat s crew re-mained un-taint-ed and though his ship was half a ri-fle shot off and an in-cor-rupt-ible sea and air rolling and flow-ing be-tween yet con-sci-en-tious-ly ad-her-ing to the timid quar-an-tine of the land he peremp-to-ri-ly re-fused to come in-to di-rect con-tact with the Pe-quod But this did by no means pre-vent all com-mu-ni-ca-tions Pre-serv-ing an in-ter-val of some few yards be-tween it-self and the ship the Jer-oboam s boat by the oc-ca-sion-al use of its oars con-trived to keep par-al-lel to the Pe-quod as she heav-i-ly forged through the sea for by this time it blew very fresh with her main top-sail aback though in-deed at times by the sud-den on-set of a large rolling wave the boat would be pushed some way ahead but would be soon skil-ful-ly brought to her prop-er bear-ings again Sub-ject to this and oth-er the like in-ter-rup-tions now and then a con-ver-sa-tion was sus-tained be-tween the two par-ties but at in-ter-vals not with-out still an-oth-er in-ter-rup-tion of a very dif-fer-ent sort Pulling an oar in the Jer-oboam s boat was a man of a sin-gu-lar ap-pear-ance even in that wild whal-ing life where in-di-vid-u-al no-ta-bil-i-ties make up all to-tal-i-ties He was a small short youngish man sprin-kled all over his face with freck-les and wear-ing re-dun-dant yel-low hair A long skirt-ed ca-bal-is-ti-cal-ly cut coat of a fad-ed wal-nut tinge en-veloped him the over-lap-ping sleeves of which were rolled up on his wrists A deep set-tled fa-nat-ic delir-i-um was in his eyes So soon as this fig-ure had been first de-scried Stubb had ex-claimed  That s he that s he  the long togged scaramouch the Town Ho s com-pa-ny told us of  Stubb here al-lud-ed to a strange sto-ry told of the Jer-oboam and a cer-tain man among her crew some time pre-vi-ous when the Pe-quod spoke the Town Ho Ac-cord-ing to this ac-count and what was sub-se-quent-ly learned it seemed that the scaramouch in ques-tion had gained a won-der-ful as-cen-den-cy over al-most ev-ery-body in the Jer-oboam His sto-ry was this He had been orig-i-nal-ly nur-tured among the crazy so-ci-ety of Neskye-u-na Shak-ers where he had been a great prophet in their cracked se-cret meet-ings hav-ing sev-er-al times de-scend-ed from heav-en by the way of a trap door an-nounc-ing the speedy open-ing of the sev-en-th vial which he car-ried in his vest pock-et but which in-stead of con-tain-ing gun-pow-der was sup-posed to be charged with lau-danum A strange apos-tolic whim hav-ing seized him he had left Neskye-u-na for Nan-tuck-et where with that cun-ning pe-cu-liar to crazi-ness he as-sumed a steady com-mon sense ex-te-ri-or and of-fered him-self as a green hand can-di-date for the Jer-oboam s whal-ing voy-age They en-gaged him but straight-way up-on the ship s get-ting out of sight of land his in-san-i-ty broke out in a freshet He an-nounced him-self as the archangel Gabriel and com-mand-ed the cap-tain to jump over-board He pub-lished his man-i-festo where-by he set him-self forth as the de-liv-erer of the isles of the sea and vi-car gen-er-al of all Ocean-i-ca The un-flinch-ing earnest-ness with which he de-clared the-se things  the dark dar-ing play of his sleep-less ex-cit-ed imag-i-na-tion and all the preter-nat-u-ral ter-rors of re-al delir-i-um unit-ed to in-vest this Gabriel in the minds of the ma-jor-i-ty of the ig-no-rant crew with an at-mo-sphere of sa-cred-ness More-over they were afraid of him As such a man how-ev-er was not of much prac-ti-cal use in the ship es-pe-cial-ly as he re-fused to work ex-cept when he pleased the in-cred-u-lous cap-tain would fain have been rid of him but ap-prised that that in-di-vid-u-al s in-ten-tion was to land him in the first con-ve-nient port the archangel forth-with opened all his seals and vial-s de-vot-ing the ship and all hands to un-con-di-tion-al perdi-tion in case this in-ten-tion was car-ried out So strong-ly did he work up-on his dis-ci-ples among the crew that at last in a body they went to the cap-tain and told him if Gabriel was sent from the ship not a man of them would re-main He was there-fore forced to re-lin-quish his plan Nor would they per-mit Gabriel to be any way mal-treat-ed say or do what he would so that it came to pass that Gabriel had the com-plete free-dom of the ship The con-se-quence of all this was that the archangel cared lit-tle or noth-ing for the cap-tain and mates and since the epi-demic had bro-ken out he car-ried a high-er hand than ev-er declar-ing that the plague as he called it was at his sole com-mand nor should it be stayed but ac-cord-ing to his good plea-sure The sailors most-ly poor dev-ils cringed and some of them fawned be-fore him in obe-di-ence to his in-struc-tions some-times ren-der-ing him per-son-al homage as to a god Such things may seem in-cred-i-ble but how-ev-er won-drous they are true Nor is the his-to-ry of fa-nat-ics half so strik-ing in re-spect to the mea-sure-less self de-cep-tion of the fa-nat-ic him-self as his mea-sure-less pow-er of de-ceiv-ing and be-dev-illing so many oth-ers But it is time to re-turn to the Pe-quod  I fear not thy epi-demic man  said Ahab from the bul-warks to Cap-tain May-hew who stood in the boat s stern  come on board  But now Gabriel start-ed to his feet  Think think of the fevers yel-low and bil-ious Be-ware of the hor-ri-ble plague   Gabriel Gabriel  cried Cap-tain May-hew  thou must ei-ther  But that in-stant a head-long wave shot the boat far ahead and its seethings drowned all speech  Hast thou seen the White Whale  de-mand-ed Ahab when the boat drift-ed back  Think think of thy whale boat stoven and sunk Be-ware of the hor-ri-ble tail   I tell thee again Gabriel that  But again the boat tore ahead as if dragged by fiends Noth-ing was said for some mo-men-ts while a suc-ces-sion of ri-otous waves rolled by which by one of those oc-ca-sion-al caprices of the seas were tum-bling not heav-ing it Mean-time the hoist-ed sperm whale s head jogged about very vi-o-lent-ly and Gabriel was seen eye-ing it with rather more ap-pre-hen-sive-ness than his archangel na-ture seemed to war-rant When this in-ter-lude was over Cap-tain May-hew be-gan a dark sto-ry con-cern-ing Moby Dick not how-ev-er with-out fre-quent in-ter-rup-tions from Gabriel when-ev-er his name was men-tioned and the crazy sea that seemed leagued with him It seemed that the Jer-oboam had not long left home when up-on speak-ing a whale ship her peo-ple were re-li-ably ap-prised of the ex-is-tence of Moby Dick and the hav-oc he had made Greed-i-ly suck-ing in this in-tel-li-gence Gabriel solemn-ly warned the cap-tain again-st at-tack-ing the White Whale in case the mon-ster should be seen in his gib-ber-ing in-san-i-ty pro-nounc-ing the White Whale to be no less a be-ing than the Shak-er God in-car-nat-ed the Shak-ers re-ceiv-ing the Bi-ble But when some year or two af-ter-wards Moby Dick was fair-ly sight-ed from the mast heads Macey the chief mate burned with ar-dour to en-coun-ter him and the cap-tain him-self be-ing not un-will-ing to let him have the op-por-tu-ni-ty de-spite all the archangel s de-nun-ci-a-tions and fore-warn-ings Macey suc-ceed-ed in per-suad-ing five men to man his boat With them he pushed off and af-ter much weary pulling and many per-ilous un-suc-cess-ful on-sets he at last suc-ceed-ed in get-ting one iron fast Mean-time Gabriel as-cend-ing to the main roy-al mast head was toss-ing one arm in fran-tic ges-tures and hurling forth prophe-cies of speedy doom to the sac-ri-le-gious as-sailan-ts of his di-vin-i-ty Now while Macey the mate was stand-ing up in his boat s bow and with all the reck-less en-er-gy of his tribe was vent-ing his wild ex-cla-ma-tions up-on the whale and es-say-ing to get a fair chance for his poised lance lo a broad white shad-ow rose from the sea by its quick fan-ning mo-tion tem-porar-i-ly tak-ing the breath out of the bod-ies of the oars-men Next in-stant the luck-less mate so full of fu-ri-ous life was smit-ten bod-i-ly in-to the air and mak-ing a long arc in his de-scent fell in-to the sea at the dis-tance of about fifty yards Not a chip of the boat was harmed nor a hair of any oars-man s head but the mate for ev-er sank It is well to paren-the-size here that of the fa-tal ac-ci-den-ts in the Sperm Whale Fish-ery this kind is per-haps al-most as fre-quent as any Some-times noth-ing is in-jured but the man who is thus an-ni-hi-lat-ed of-ten-er the boat s bow is knocked off or the thigh board in which the heads-man stands is torn from its place and ac-com-pa-nies the body But strangest of all is the cir-cum-stance that in more in-stances than one when the body has been re-cov-ered not a sin-gle mark of vi-o-lence is dis-cernible the man be-ing stark dead The whole calami-ty with the falling form of Macey was plain-ly de-scried from the ship Rais-ing a pierc-ing shriek  The vial the vial  Gabriel called off the ter-ror strick-en crew from the fur-ther hunt-ing of the whale This ter-ri-ble event clothed the archangel with added in-flu-ence be-cause his cred-u-lous dis-ci-ples be-lieved that he had specif-i-cal-ly fore an-nounced it in-stead of on-ly mak-ing a gen-er-al prophe-cy which any one might have done and so have chanced to hit one of many marks in the wide margin al-lowed He be-came a name-less ter-ror to the ship May-hew hav-ing con-clud-ed his nar-ra-tion Ahab put such ques-tions to him that the stranger cap-tain could not for-bear in-quir-ing whether he in-tend-ed to hunt the White Whale if op-por-tu-ni-ty should of-fer To which Ahab an-swered  Aye  Straight-way then Gabriel on-ce more start-ed to his feet glar-ing up-on the old man and ve-he-ment-ly ex-claimed with down-ward point-ed fin-ger  Think think of the blas-phe-mer dead and down there  be-ware of the blas-phe-mer s end  Ahab stolid-ly turned aside then said to May-hew  Cap-tain I have just bethought me of my let-ter bag there is a let-ter for one of thy of-fi-cers if I mis-take not Star-buck look over the bag  Every whale ship takes out a good-ly num-ber of let-ters for var-i-ous ships whose de-liv-ery to the per-sons to whom they may be ad-dressed de-pends up-on the mere chance of en-coun-ter-ing them in the four oceans Thus most let-ters nev-er reach their mark and many are on-ly re-ceived af-ter at-tain-ing an age of two or three years or more Soon Star-buck re-turned with a let-ter in his hand It was sore-ly tum-bled damp and cov-ered with a dull spot-ted green mould in con-se-quence of be-ing kept in a dark lock-er of the cab-in Of such a let-ter Death him-self might well have been the post boy  Can st not read it  cried Ahab  Give it me man Aye aye it s but a dim scrawl  what s this  As he was study-ing it out Star-buck took a long cut-ting spade pole and with his knife slight-ly split the end to in-sert the let-ter there and in that way hand it to the boat with-out its com-ing any closer to the ship Mean-time Ahab hold-ing the let-ter mut-tered  Mr Har yes Mr Har-ry a wom-an s pin-ny hand  the man s wife I ll wa-ger  Aye Mr Har-ry Macey Ship Jer-oboam  why it s Macey and he s dead   Poor fel-low poor fel-low and from his wife  sighed May-hew  but let me have it   Nay keep it thy-self  cried Gabriel to Ahab  thou art soon go-ing that way   Curs-es throt-tle thee  yelled Ahab  Cap-tain May-hew stand by now to re-ceive it and tak-ing the fa-tal mis-sive from Star-buck s hands he caught it in the slit of the pole and reached it over to-wards the boat But as he did so the oars-men ex-pec-tant-ly de-sist-ed from row-ing the boat drift-ed a lit-tle to-wards the ship s stern so that as if by mag-ic the let-ter sud-den-ly ranged along with Gabriel s ea-ger hand He clutched it in an in-stant seized the boat knife and im-pal-ing the let-ter on it sent it thus load-ed back in-to the ship It fell at Ahab s feet Then Gabriel shrieked out to his com-rades to give way with their oars and in that man-ner the muti-nous boat rapid-ly shot away from the Pe-quod As af-ter this in-ter-lude the sea-men re-sumed their work up-on the jack-et of the whale many strange things were hint-ed in ref-er-ence to this wild af-fair CHAPTER 72 The Mon-key Rope In the tu-mul-tuous busi-ness of cut-ting in and at-tend-ing to a whale there is much run-ning back-wards and for-wards among the crew Now hands are want-ed here and then again hands are want-ed there There is no stay-ing in any one place for at one and the same time ev-ery-thing has to be done ev-ery-where It is much the same with him who en-deav-ors the de-scrip-tion of the scene We must now re-trace our way a lit-tle It was men-tioned that up-on first break-ing ground in the whale s back the blub-ber hook was in-sert-ed in-to the orig-i-nal hole there cut by the spades of the mates But how did so clum-sy and weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that hole It was in-sert-ed there by my par-tic-u-lar friend Quee-queg whose du-ty it was as har-pooneer to de-scend up-on the mon-ster s back for the spe-cial pur-pose re-ferred to But in very many cas-es cir-cum-stances re-quire that the har-pooneer shall re-main on the whale till the whole flens-ing or strip-ping op-er-a-tion is con-clud-ed The whale be it ob-served lies al-most en-tire-ly sub-merged ex-cept-ing the im-me-di-ate parts op-er-at-ed up-on So down there some ten feet be-low the lev-el of the deck the poor har-pooneer floun-ders about half on the whale and half in the wa-ter as the vast mass re-volves like a tread mill be-neath him On the oc-ca-sion in ques-tion Quee-queg fig-ured in the High-land cos-tume a shirt and sock-s in which to my eyes at least he ap-peared to un-com-mon ad-van-tage and no one had a bet-ter chance to ob-serve him as will present-ly be seen Be-ing the sav-age s bows-man that is the per-son who pulled the bow oar in his boat the sec-ond one from for-ward it was my cheer-ful du-ty to at-tend up-on him while tak-ing that hard scrab-ble scram-ble up-on the dead whale s back You have seen Ital-ian or-gan boys hold-ing a danc-ing ape by a long cord Just so from the ship s steep side did I hold Quee-queg down there in the sea by what is tech-ni-cal-ly called in the fish-ery a mon-key rope at-tached to a strong strip of can-vas belt-ed round his waist It was a hu-mor-ous-ly per-ilous busi-ness for both of us For be-fore we pro-ceed fur-ther it must be said that the mon-key rope was fast at both ends fast to Quee-queg s broad can-vas belt and fast to my nar-row leather one So that for bet-ter or for worse we two for the time were wed-ded and should poor Quee-queg sink to rise no more then both us-age and hon-or de-mand-ed that in-stead of cut-ting the cord it should drag me down in his wake So then an elon-gat-ed Si-ame-se lig-a-ture unit-ed us Quee-queg was my own in-sep-a-ra-ble twin broth-er nor could I any way get rid of the dan-ger-ous li-a-bil-i-ties which the hempen bond en-tailed So strong-ly and meta-phys-i-cal-ly did I con-ceive of my sit-u-a-tion then that while earnest-ly watch-ing his mo-tions I seemed dis-tinct-ly to per-ceive that my own in-di-vid-u-al-i-ty was now merged in a joint stock com-pa-ny of two that my free will had re-ceived a mor-tal wound and that an-oth-er s mis-take or mis-for-tune might plunge in-no-cent me in-to un-merit-ed dis-as-ter and death There-fore I saw that here was a sort of in-ter-reg-num in Prov-i-dence for its even hand-ed eq-ui-ty nev-er could have so gross an in-jus-tice And yet still fur-ther pon-der-ing while I jerked him now and then from be-tween the whale and ship which would threat-en to jam him still fur-ther pon-der-ing I say I saw that this sit-u-a-tion of mine was the pre-cise sit-u-a-tion of ev-ery mor-tal that breathes on-ly in most cas-es he one way or oth-er has this Si-ame-se con-nex-ion with a plu-ral-i-ty of oth-er mor-tals If your banker breaks you snap if your apothe-cary by mis-take sends you poi-son in your pil-ls you die True you may say that by ex-ceed-ing cau-tion you may pos-si-bly es-cape the-se and the mul-ti-tudi-nous oth-er evil chances of life But han-dle Quee-queg s mon-key rope heed-ful-ly as I would some-times he jerked it so that I came very near slid-ing over-board Nor could I pos-si-bly for-get that do what I would I on-ly had the man-age-ment of one end of it The mon-key rope is found in all whalers but it was on-ly in the Pe-quod that the mon-key and his hold-er were ev-er tied to-geth-er This im-prove-ment up-on the orig-i-nal us-age was in-tro-duced by no less a man than Stubb in or-der to af-ford the im-per-illed har-pooneer the strongest pos-si-ble guar-an-tee for the faith-ful-ness and vig-i-lance of his mon-key rope hold-er I have hint-ed that I would of-ten jerk poor Quee-queg from be-tween the whale and the ship where he would oc-ca-sion-al-ly fall from the in-ces-sant rolling and sway-ing of both But this was not the on-ly jam-ming jeop-ardy he was ex-posed to Unap-palled by the mas-sacre made up-on them dur-ing the night the sharks now fresh-ly and more keen-ly al-lured by the be-fore pent blood which be-gan to flow from the car-cass the ra-bid crea-tures swarmed round it like bees in a bee-hive And right in among those sharks was Quee-queg who of-ten pushed them aside with his floun-der-ing feet A thing al-to-geth-er in-cred-i-ble were it not that at-tract-ed by such prey as a dead whale the oth-er-wise mis-cel-la-neous-ly car-niv-o-rous shark will sel-dom touch a man Nev-er-the-less it may well be be-lieved that since they have such a ravenous fin-ger in the pie it is deemed but wise to look sharp to them Ac-cord-ing-ly be-sides the mon-key rope with which I now and then jerked the poor fel-low from too close a vicin-i-ty to the maw of what seemed a pe-cu-liar-ly fe-ro-cious shark he was pro-vid-ed with still an-oth-er pro-tec-tion Sus-pend-ed over the side in one of the stages Tashte-go and Dag-goo con-tin-u-al-ly flour-ished over his head a cou-ple of keen whale spades where-with they slaugh-tered as many sharks as they could reach This pro-ce-dure of theirs to be sure was very dis-in-ter-est-ed and benev-o-lent of them They meant Quee-queg s best hap-pi-ness I ad-mit but in their hasty zeal to be-friend him and from the cir-cum-stance that both he and the sharks were at times half hid-den by the blood mud-dled wa-ter those in-dis-creet spades of theirs would come nearer am-pu-tat-ing a leg than a tail But poor Quee-queg I sup-pose strain-ing and gasp-ing there with that great iron hook poor Quee-queg I sup-pose on-ly prayed to his Yo-jo and gave up his life in-to the hands of his gods Well well my dear com-rade and twin broth-er thought I as I drew in and then slacked off the rope to ev-ery swell of the sea what mat-ters it af-ter all Are you not the pre-cious im-age of each and all of us men in this whal-ing world That un-sound-ed ocean you gasp in is Life those sharks your foes those spades your friends and what be-tween sharks and spades you are in a sad pick-le and per-il poor lad But courage there is good cheer in store for you Quee-queg For now as with blue lips and blood shot eyes the ex-haust-ed sav-age at last climbs up the chains and stands all drip-ping and in-vol-un-tar-i-ly trem-bling over the side the stew-ard ad-vances and with a benev-o-lent con-so-la-to-ry glance hands him what Some hot Cog-nac No hands him ye gods hands him a cup of tepid gin-ger and wa-ter  Ginger Do I smell gin-ger  sus-pi-cious-ly asked Stubb com-ing near  Yes this must be gin-ger  peer-ing in-to the as yet un-tast-ed cup Then stand-ing as if in-cred-u-lous for a while he calm-ly walked to-wards the as-ton-ished stew-ard slow-ly say-ing  Ginger gin-ger and will you have the good-ness to tell me Mr Dough Boy where lies the virtue of gin-ger Ginger is gin-ger the sort of fu-el you use Dough boy to kindle a fire in this shiv-er-ing can-ni-bal Ginger  what the dev-il is gin-ger Sea coal fire-wood  lu-cifer match-es  tin-der  gun-pow-der  what the dev-il is gin-ger I say that you of-fer this cup to our poor Quee-queg here   There is some sneak-ing Tem-per-ance So-ci-ety move-ment about this busi-ness  he sud-den-ly added now ap-proach-ing Star-buck who had just come from for-ward  Will you look at that kan-nakin sir smell of it if you please  Then watch-ing the mate s coun-te-nance he added  The stew-ard Mr Star-buck had the face to of-fer that calomel and jalap to Quee-queg there this in-stant off the whale Is the stew-ard an apothe-cary sir and may I ask whether this is the sort of bit-ters by which he blows back the life in-to a half drowned man   I trust not  said Star-buck  it is poor stuff enough   Aye aye stew-ard  cried Stubb  we ll teach you to drug a har-pooneer none of your apothe-cary s medicine here you want to poi-son us do ye You have got out in-sur-ances on our lives and want to mur-der us all and pock-et the pro-ceeds do ye   It was not me  cried Dough Boy  it was Aunt Char-i-ty that brought the gin-ger on board and bade me nev-er give the har-pooneers any spir-its but on-ly this gin-ger jub so she called it   Ginger jub you gin-ger-ly ras-cal take that and run along with ye to the lock-ers and get some-thing bet-ter I hope I do no wrong Mr Star-buck It is the cap-tain s or-der-s grog for the har-pooneer on a whale   Enough  replied Star-buck  on-ly don t hit him again but   Oh I nev-er hurt when I hit ex-cept when I hit a whale or some-thing of that sort and this fel-low s a weazel What were you about say-ing sir   On-ly this go down with him and get what thou wan-test thy-self  When Stubb reap-peared he came with a dark flask in one hand and a sort of tea cad-dy in the oth-er The first con-tained strong spir-its and was hand-ed to Quee-queg the sec-ond was Aunt Char-i-ty s gift and that was freely given to the waves CHAPTER 73 Stubb and Flask kill a Right Whale and Then Have a Talk over Him It must be borne in mind that all this time we have a Sperm Whale s prodi-gious head hang-ing to the Pe-quod s side But we must let it con-tin-ue hang-ing there a while till we can get a chance to at-tend to it For the pre-sent oth-er mat-ters press and the best we can do now for the head is to pray heav-en the tack-les may hold Now dur-ing the past night and forenoon the Pe-quod had grad-u-al-ly drift-ed in-to a sea which by its oc-ca-sion-al patch-es of yel-low brit gave un-usu-al to-kens of the vicin-i-ty of Right Whales a species of the Le-viathan that but few sup-posed to be at this par-tic-u-lar time lurk-ing any-where near And though all hands com-mon-ly dis-dained the cap-ture of those in-fe-ri-or crea-tures and though the Pe-quod was not com-mis-sioned to cruise for them at all and though she had passed num-bers of them near the Crozetts with-out low-er-ing a boat yet now that a Sperm Whale had been brought alongside and be-head-ed to the sur-prise of all the an-nounce-ment was made that a Right Whale should be cap-tured that day if op-por-tu-ni-ty of-fered Nor was this long want-ing Tall spouts were seen to lee-ward and two boats Stub-b s and Flask s were de-tached in pur-suit Pulling fur-ther and fur-ther away they at last be-came al-most in-vis-i-ble to the men at the mast head But sud-den-ly in the dis-tance they saw a great heap of tu-mul-tuous white wa-ter and soon af-ter news came from aloft that one or both the boats must be fast An in-ter-val passed and the boats were in plain sight in the act of be-ing dragged right to-wards the ship by the tow-ing whale So close did the mon-ster come to the hull that at first it seemed as if he meant it mal-ice but sud-den-ly go-ing down in a mael-strom with-in three rods of the planks he whol-ly dis-ap-peared from view as if div-ing un-der the keel  Cut cut  was the cry from the ship to the boats which for one in-stant seemed on the point of be-ing brought with a dead-ly dash again-st the ves-sel s side But hav-ing plen-ty of line yet in the tubs and the whale not sound-ing very rapid-ly they paid out abun-dance of rope and at the same time pulled with all their might so as to get ahead of the ship For a few min-utes the strug-gle was in-tense-ly crit-i-cal for while they still slacked out the tight-ened line in one di-rec-tion and still plied their oars in an-oth-er the con-tend-ing strain threat-ened to take them un-der But it was on-ly a few feet ad-vance they sought to gain And they stuck to it till they did gain it when in-stant-ly a swift tremor was felt run-ning like light-ning along the keel as the strained line scrap-ing be-neath the ship sud-den-ly rose to view un-der her bows snap-ping and quiv-er-ing and so fling-ing off its drip-pings that the drops fell like bits of bro-ken glass on the wa-ter while the whale be-yond al-so rose to sight and on-ce more the boats were free to fly But the fagged whale abat-ed his speed and blind-ly al-ter-ing his course went round the stern of the ship tow-ing the two boats af-ter him so that they per-formed a com-plete cir-cuit Mean-time they hauled more and more up-on their lines till close flank-ing him on both sides Stubb an-swered Flask with lance for lance and thus round and round the Pe-quod the bat-tle went while the mul-ti-tudes of sharks that had be-fore swum round the Sperm Whale s body rushed to the fresh blood that was spilled thirsti-ly drink-ing at ev-ery new gash as the ea-ger Is-raelites did at the new burst-ing foun-tains that poured from the smit-ten rock At last his spout grew thick and with a fright-ful roll and vom-it he turned up-on his back a corpse While the two heads-men were en-gaged in mak-ing fast cords to his flukes and in oth-er ways get-ting the mass in readi-ness for tow-ing some con-ver-sa-tion en-sued be-tween them  I won-der what the old man wan-ts with this lump of foul lard  said Stubb not with-out some dis-gust at the thought of hav-ing to do with so ig-no-ble a leviathan  Wan-ts with it  said Flask coil-ing some spare line in the boat s bow  did you nev-er hear that the ship which but on-ce has a Sperm Whale s head hoist-ed on her star-board side and at the same time a Right Whale s on the lar-board did you nev-er hear Stubb that that ship can nev-er af-ter-wards cap-size   Why not  I don t know but I heard that gam-bo-ge ghost of a Fedal-lah say-ing so and he seems to know all about ship-s char-ms But I some-times think he ll charm the ship to no good at last I don t half like that chap Stubb Did you ev-er no-tice how that tusk of his is a sort of carved in-to a snake s head Stubb   Sink him I nev-er look at him at all but if ev-er I get a chance of a dark night and he stand-ing hard by the bul-warks and no one by look down there Flask  point-ing in-to the sea with a pe-cu-liar mo-tion of both hand-s  Aye will I Flask I take that Fedal-lah to be the dev-il in dis-guise Do you be-lieve that cock and bull sto-ry about his hav-ing been stowed away on board ship He s the dev-il I say The rea-son why you don t see his tail is be-cause he tucks it up out of sight he car-ries it coiled away in his pock-et I guess Blast him now that I think of it he s al-ways want-ing oakum to stuff in-to the toes of his boots   He sleeps in his boots don t he He has-n t got any ham-mock but I ve seen him lay of nights in a coil of rig-ging   No doubt and it s be-cause of his cursed tail he coils it down do ye see in the eye of the rig-ging   What s the old man have so much to do with him for   Strik-ing up a swap or a bar-gain I sup-pose   Bar-gain  about what   Why do ye see the old man is hard bent af-ter that White Whale and the dev-il there is try-ing to come round him and get him to swap away his sil-ver watch or his soul or some-thing of that sort and then he ll sur-ren-der Moby Dick   Pooh Stubb you are sky-lark-ing how can Fedal-lah do that   I don t know Flask but the dev-il is a cu-ri-ous chap and a wicked one I tell ye Why they say as how he went a saun-ter-ing in-to the old flag ship on-ce switch-ing his tail about dev-il-ish easy and gen-tle-man-like and in-quir-ing if the old gov-er-nor was at home Well he was at home and asked the dev-il what he want-ed The dev-il switch-ing his hoofs up and says  I want John   What for  says the old gov-er-nor  What busi-ness is that of yours  says the dev-il get-ting mad   I want to use him   Take him  says the gov-er-nor and by the Lord Flask if the dev-il did-n t give John the Asi-at-ic cholera be-fore he got through with him I ll eat this whale in one mouth-ful But look sharp ain t you all ready there Well then pull ahead and let s get the whale alongside   I think I re-mem-ber some such sto-ry as you were telling  said Flask when at last the two boats were slow-ly ad-vanc-ing with their bur-den to-wards the ship  but I can t re-mem-ber where   Three Spa-niards Ad-ven-tures of those three bloody mind-ed sol-da-does Did ye read it there Flask I guess ye did   No nev-er saw such a book heard of it though But now tell me Stubb do you sup-pose that that dev-il you was speak-ing of just now was the same you say is now on board the Pe-quod   Am I the same man that helped kill this whale Does-n t the dev-il live for ev-er who ev-er heard that the dev-il was dead Did you ev-er see any par-son a wear-ing mourn-ing for the dev-il And if the dev-il has a latch key to get in-to the ad-mi-ral s cab-in don t you sup-pose he can crawl in-to a port-hole Tell me that Mr Flask   How old do you sup-pose Fedal-lah is Stubb   Do you see that main-mast there  point-ing to the ship  well that s the fig-ure one now take all the hoops in the Pe-quod s hold and string along in a row with that mast for oughts do you see well that would-n t be-gin to be Fedal-lah s age Nor all the coop-ers in cre-ation could-n t show hoops enough to make oughts enough   But see here Stubb I thought you a lit-tle boast-ed just now that you meant to give Fedal-lah a sea toss if you got a good chance Now if he s so old as all those hoops of yours come to and if he is go-ing to live for ev-er what good will it do to pitch him over-board tell me that  Give him a good duck-ing any-how   But he d crawl back   Duck him again and keep duck-ing him   Sup-pose he should take it in-to his head to duck you though yes and drown you what then   I should like to see him try it I d give him such a pair of black eyes that he would-n t dare to show his face in the ad-mi-ral s cab-in again for a long while let alone down in the or-lop there where he lives and here-abouts on the up-per decks where he sneaks so much Damn the dev-il Flask so you sup-pose I m afraid of the dev-il Who s afraid of him ex-cept the old gov-er-nor who dares-n t catch him and put him in dou-ble dar-bies as he de-serves but lets him go about kid-nap-ping peo-ple aye and signed a bond with him that all the peo-ple the dev-il kid-napped he d roast for him There s a gov-er-nor   Do you sup-pose Fedal-lah wan-ts to kid-nap Cap-tain Ahab   Do I sup-pose it You ll know it be-fore long Flask But I am go-ing now to keep a sharp look out on him and if I see any-thing very sus-pi-cious go-ing on I ll just take him by the nape of his neck and say Look here Beelze-bub you don t do it and if he makes any fuss by the Lord I ll make a grab in-to his pock-et for his tail take it to the cap-stan and give him such a wrench-ing and heav-ing that his tail will come short off at the stump do you see and then I rather guess when he finds him-self docked in that queer fash-ion he ll sneak off with-out the poor sat-is-fac-tion of feel-ing his tail be-tween his legs   And what will you do with the tail Stubb   Do with it Sell it for an ox whip when we get home  what else   Now do you mean what you say and have been say-ing all along Stubb   Mean or not mean here we are at the ship  The boats were here hailed to tow the whale on the lar-board side where fluke chains and oth-er nec-es-saries were al-ready pre-pared for se-cur-ing him  Did-n t I tell you so  said Flask  yes you ll soon see this right whale s head hoist-ed up op-po-site that par-ma-cetti s  In good time Flask s say-ing proved true As be-fore the Pe-quod steeply leaned over to-wards the sperm whale s head now by the coun-ter-poise of both heads she re-gained her even keel though sore-ly strained you may well be-lieve So when on one side you hoist in Lock-e s head you go over that way but now on the oth-er side hoist in Kan-t s and you come back again but in very poor plight Thus some minds for ev-er keep trim-ming boat Oh ye fool-ish throw all the-se thun-der heads over-board and then you will float light and right In dis-pos-ing of the body of a right whale when brought alongside the ship the same pre-lim-i-nary pro-ceed-ings com-mon-ly take place as in the case of a sperm whale on-ly in the lat-ter in-stance the head is cut off whole but in the for-mer the lips and tongue are sep-a-rate-ly re-moved and hoist-ed on deck with all the well known black bone at-tached to what is called the crown piece But noth-ing like this in the pre-sent case had been done The car-cas-es of both whales had dropped astern and the head laden ship not a lit-tle re-sem-bled a mule car-ry-ing a pair of over-bur-den-ing pan-niers Mean-time Fedal-lah was calm-ly eye-ing the right whale s head and ev-er and anon glanc-ing from the deep wrin-kles there to the lines in his own hand And Ahab chanced so to stand that the Parsee oc-cu-pied his shad-ow while if the Parsee s shad-ow was there at all it seemed on-ly to blend with and length-en Ahab s As the crew toiled on La-p-lan-dish spec-u-la-tions were bandied among them con-cern-ing all the-se pass-ing things CHAPTER 74 The Sperm Whale s Head Con-trast-ed View Here now are two great whales lay-ing their heads to-geth-er let us join them and lay to-geth-er our own Of the grand or-der of fo-lio leviathans the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale are by far the most note-wor-thy They are the on-ly whales reg-u-lar-ly hunt-ed by man To the Nan-tuck-eter they pre-sent the two ex-tremes of all the known va-ri-eties of the whale As the ex-ter-nal dif-fer-ence be-tween them is main-ly ob-serv-able in their heads and as a head of each is this mo-ment hang-ing from the Pe-quod s side and as we may freely go from one to the oth-er by mere-ly step-ping across the deck  where I should like to know will you ob-tain a bet-ter chance to study prac-ti-cal ce-tol-o-gy than here In the first place you are struck by the gen-er-al con-trast be-tween the-se heads Both are mas-sive enough in all con-science but there is a cer-tain math-e-mat-i-cal sym-me-try in the Sperm Whale s which the Right Whale s sad-ly lacks There is more char-ac-ter in the Sperm Whale s head As you be-hold it you in-vol-un-tar-i-ly yield the im-mense su-pe-ri-or-i-ty to him in point of per-vad-ing dig-ni-ty In the pre-sent in-stance too this dig-ni-ty is height-ened by the pep-per and salt colour of his head at the sum-mit giv-ing to-ken of ad-vanced age and large ex-pe-ri-ence In short he is what the fish-er-men tech-ni-cal-ly call a  grey head-ed whale  Let us now note what is least dis-sim-i-lar in the-se head-s name-ly the two most im-por-tant or-gans the eye and the ear Far back on the side of the head and low down near the an-gle of ei-ther whale s jaw if you nar-row-ly search you will at last see a lash-less eye which you would fan-cy to be a young colt s eye so out of all pro-por-tion is it to the mag-ni-tude of the head Now from this pe-cu-liar side-way po-si-tion of the whale s eyes it is plain that he can nev-er see an ob-ject which is ex-act-ly ahead no more than he can one ex-act-ly astern In a word the po-si-tion of the whale s eyes cor-re-sponds to that of a man s ears and you may fan-cy for your-self how it would fare with you did you side-ways sur-vey ob-jec-ts through your ears You would find that you could on-ly com-mand some thir-ty de-grees of vi-sion in ad-vance of the straight side line of sight and about thir-ty more be-hind it If your bit-ter-est foe were walk-ing straight to-wards you with dag-ger up-lift-ed in broad day you would not be able to see him any more than if he were steal-ing up-on you from be-hind In a word you would have two backs so to speak but at the same time al-so two fron-ts side fron-ts for what is it that makes the front of a man what in-deed but his eyes More-over while in most oth-er an-i-mals that I can now think of the eyes are so plant-ed as im-per-cep-ti-bly to blend their vi-su-al pow-er so as to pro-duce one pic-ture and not two to the brain the pe-cu-liar po-si-tion of the whale s eyes ef-fec-tu-al-ly di-vid-ed as they are by many cu-bic feet of solid head which tow-ers be-tween them like a great moun-tain sep-a-rat-ing two lakes in val-leys this of course must whol-ly sep-a-rate the im-pres-sions which each in-de-pen-dent or-gan im-parts The whale there-fore must see one dis-tinct pic-ture on this side and an-oth-er dis-tinct pic-ture on that side while all be-tween must be pro-found dark-ness and noth-ing-ness to him Man may in ef-fect be said to look out on the world from a sen-try box with two joined sash-es for his win-dow But with the whale the-se two sash-es are sep-a-rate-ly in-sert-ed mak-ing two dis-tinct win-dows but sad-ly im-pair-ing the view This pe-cu-liar-i-ty of the whale s eyes is a thing al-ways to be borne in mind in the fish-ery and to be re-mem-bered by the read-er in some sub-se-quent sce-nes A cu-ri-ous and most puz-zling ques-tion might be start-ed con-cern-ing this vi-su-al mat-ter as touch-ing the Le-viathan But I must be con-tent with a hint So long as a man s eyes are open in the light the act of see-ing is in-vol-un-tary that is he can-not then help me-chan-i-cal-ly see-ing what-ev-er ob-jec-ts are be-fore him Nev-er-the-less any one s ex-pe-ri-ence will teach him that though he can take in an undis-crim-i-nat-ing sweep of things at one glance it is quite im-pos-si-ble for him at-ten-tive-ly and com-plete-ly to ex-am-ine any two things how-ev-er large or how-ev-er smal-l at one and the same in-stant of time nev-er mind if they lie side by side and touch each oth-er But if you now come to sep-a-rate the-se two ob-jec-ts and sur-round each by a cir-cle of pro-found dark-ness then in or-der to see one of them in such a man-ner as to bring your mind to bear on it the oth-er will be ut-ter-ly ex-clud-ed from your con-tem-po-rary con-scious-ness How is it then with the whale True both his eyes in them-selves must si-mul-ta-ne-ous-ly act but is his brain so much more com-pre-hen-sive com-bin-ing and sub-tle than man s that he can at the same mo-ment of time at-ten-tive-ly ex-am-ine two dis-tinct prospec-ts one on one side of him and the oth-er in an ex-act-ly op-po-site di-rec-tion If he can then is it as mar-vel-lous a thing in him as if a man were able si-mul-ta-ne-ous-ly to go through the demon-stra-tions of two dis-tinct prob-lems in Eu-clid Nor strict-ly in-ves-ti-gat-ed is there any in-con-gruity in this com-par-ison It may be but an idle whim but it has al-ways seemed to me that the ex-traor-di-nary vac-il-la-tions of move-ment dis-played by some whales when be-set by three or four boats the timid-i-ty and li-a-bil-i-ty to queer frights so com-mon to such whales I think that all this in-di-rect-ly pro-ceeds from the help-less per-plex-i-ty of vo-li-tion in which their di-vid-ed and di-a-met-ri-cal-ly op-po-site pow-ers of vi-sion must in-volve them But the ear of the whale is full as cu-ri-ous as the eye If you are an en-tire stranger to their race you might hunt over the-se two heads for hours and nev-er dis-cov-er that or-gan The ear has no ex-ter-nal leaf what-ev-er and in-to the hole it-self you can hard-ly in-sert a quill so won-drous-ly min-ute is it It is lodged a lit-tle be-hind the eye With re-spect to their ears this im-por-tant dif-fer-ence is to be ob-served be-tween the sperm whale and the right While the ear of the for-mer has an ex-ter-nal open-ing that of the lat-ter is en-tire-ly and even-ly cov-ered over with a mem-brane so as to be quite im-per-cep-ti-ble from with-out Is it not cu-ri-ous that so vast a be-ing as the whale should see the world through so small an eye and hear the thun-der through an ear which is small-er than a hare s But if his eyes were broad as the lens of Her-schel s great tele-scope and his ears ca-pa-cious as the porch-es of cathe-drals would that make him any longer of sight or sharper of hear-ing Not at all  Why then do you try to  en-large your mind Subtilize it Let us now with what-ev-er levers and steam en-gi-nes we have at hand cant over the sperm whale s head that it may lie bot-tom up then as-cend-ing by a lad-der to the sum-mit have a peep down the mouth and were it not that the body is now com-plete-ly sep-a-rat-ed from it with a lantern we might de-scend in-to the great Ken-tucky Mam-moth Cave of his stom-ach But let us hold on here by this tooth and look about us where we are What a re-al-ly beau-ti-ful and chaste look-ing mouth from floor to ceil-ing lined or rather pa-pered with a glis-ten-ing white mem-brane glossy as bridal satins But come out now and look at this por-ten-tous low-er jaw which seems like the long nar-row lid of an im-mense snuff box with the hinge at one end in-stead of one side If you pry it up so as to get it over-head and ex-pose its rows of teeth it seems a ter-ri-fic portcullis and such alas it proves to many a poor wight in the fish-ery up-on whom the-se spikes fall with im-pal-ing force But far more ter-ri-ble is it to be-hold when fath-oms down in the sea you see some sulky whale float-ing there sus-pend-ed with his prodi-gious jaw some fif-teen feet long hang-ing straight down at right an-gles with his body for all the world like a ship s jib boom This whale is not dead he is on-ly dispirit-ed out of sorts per-haps hypochon-dri-ac and so supine that the hinges of his jaw have re-laxed leav-ing him there in that un-gain-ly sort of plight a re-proach to all his tribe who must no doubt im-pre-cate lock jaws up-on him In most cas-es this low-er jaw be-ing eas-i-ly un-hinged by a prac-tised artist is dis-en-gaged and hoist-ed on deck for the pur-pose of ex-tract-ing the ivory teeth and fur-nish-ing a sup-ply of that hard white whale-bone with which the fish-er-men fash-ion all sorts of cu-ri-ous ar-ti-cles in-clud-ing canes um-brel-la stocks and han-dles to rid-ing whips With a long weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board as if it were an an-chor and when the prop-er time comes some few days af-ter the oth-er work Quee-queg Dag-goo and Tashte-go be-ing all ac-com-plished den-tists are set to draw-ing teeth With a keen cut-ting spade Quee-queg lances the gums then the jaw is lashed down to ring-bolts and a tack-le be-ing rigged from aloft they drag out the-se teeth as Michi-gan ox-en drag stumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands There are gen-er-al-ly forty two teeth in all in old whales much worn down but un-de-cayed nor filled af-ter our ar-ti-fi-cial fash-ion The jaw is af-ter-wards sawn in-to slabs and piled away like joists for build-ing hous-es CHAPTER 75 The Right Whale s Head Con-trast-ed View Cross-ing the deck let us now have a good long look at the Right Whale s head As in gen-er-al shape the no-ble Sperm Whale s head may be com-pared to a Ro-man war char-i-ot es-pe-cial-ly in front where it is so broad-ly round-ed so at a broad view the Right Whale s head bears a rather in-el-e-gant re-sem-blance to a gi-gan-tic gal-liot toed shoe Two hun-dred years ago an old Dutch voy-ager likened its shape to that of a shoe-mak-er s last And in this same last or shoe that old wom-an of the nurs-ery tale with the swarm-ing brood might very com-fort-ably be lodged she and all her progeny But as you come nearer to this great head it be-gins to as-sume dif-fer-ent as-pec-ts ac-cord-ing to your point of view If you stand on its sum-mit and look at the-se two F shaped spout-holes you would take the whole head for an enor-mous bass vi-ol and the-se spir-a-cles the aper-tures in its sound-ing board Then again if you fix your eye up-on this strange crest-ed comb like in-crus-ta-tion on the top of the mass this green bar-na-cled thing which the Green-lan-ders call the  crown  and the South-ern fish-ers the  bon-net of the Right Whale fix-ing your eyes sole-ly on this you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak with a bird s nest in its crotch At any rate when you watch those live crabs that nestle here on this bon-net such an idea will be al-most sure to oc-cur to you un-less in-deed your fan-cy has been fixed by the tech-ni-cal term  crown al-so be-stowed up-on it in which case you will take great in-ter-est in think-ing how this mighty mon-ster is ac-tu-al-ly a di-ademed king of the sea whose green crown has been put to-geth-er for him in this mar-vel-lous man-ner But if this whale be a king he is a very sulky look-ing fel-low to grace a di-adem Look at that hang-ing low-er lip what a huge sulk and pout is there a sulk and pout by car-pen-ter s mea-sure-ment about twen-ty feet long and five feet deep a sulk and pout that will yield you some 5 gal-lons of oil and more A great pity now that this un-for-tu-nate whale should be hare lipped The fis-sure is about a foot across Prob-a-bly the moth-er dur-ing an im-por-tant in-ter-val was sail-ing down the Peru-vian coast when earth-quakes caused the beach to gape Over this lip as over a slip-pery thresh-old we now slide in-to the mouth Upon my word were I at Mack-i-naw I should take this to be the in-side of an In-di-an wig-wam Good Lord is this the road that Jon-ah went The roof is about twelve feet high and runs to a pret-ty sharp an-gle as if there were a reg-u-lar ridge pole there while the-se ribbed arched hairy sides pre-sent us with those won-drous half ver-ti-cal scimetar shaped slats of whale-bone say three hun-dred on a side which de-pend-ing from the up-per part of the head or crown bone form those Vene-tian blinds which have else-where been cur-so-ri-ly men-tioned The edges of the-se bones are fringed with hairy fi-bres through which the Right Whale strains the wa-ter and in whose in-tri-ca-cies he re-tains the small fish when open-mouthed he goes through the seas of brit in feed-ing time In the cen-tral blinds of bone as they stand in their nat-u-ral or-der there are cer-tain cu-ri-ous marks curves hol-lows and ridges where-by some whale-men cal-cu-late the crea-ture s age as the age of an oak by its cir-cu-lar rings Though the cer-tain-ty of this cri-te-ri-on is far from demon-stra-ble yet it has the sa-vor of ana-log-i-cal prob-a-bil-i-ty At any rate if we yield to it we must grant a far greater age to the Right Whale than at first glance will seem rea-son-able In old times there seem to have pre-vailed the most cu-ri-ous fan-cies con-cern-ing the-se blinds One voy-ager in Pur-chas cal-ls them the won-drous  whisker-s in-side of the whale s mouth an-oth-er  hogs bristles a third old gen-tle-man in Hack-luyt us-es the fol-low-ing el-e-gant lan-guage  There are about two hun-dred and fifty fins grow-ing on each side of his up-per chop which arch over his tongue on each side of his mouth  This re-minds us that the Right Whale re-al-ly has a sort of whisker or rather a mous-tache con-sist-ing of a few scat-tered white hairs on the up-per part of the out-er end of the low-er jaw Some-times the-se tufts im-part a rather brig-an-dish ex-pres-sion to his oth-er-wise solemn coun-te-nance As ev-ery one knows the-se same  hogs bristles   fins   whiskers   blinds  or what-ev-er you please fur-nish to the ladies their busks and oth-er stiff-en-ing con-trivances But in this par-tic-u-lar the de-mand has long been on the de-cline It was in Queen An-ne s time that the bone was in its glo-ry the far-thin-gale be-ing then all the fash-ion And as those an-cient dames moved about gai-ly though in the jaws of the whale as you may say even so in a show-er with the like thought-less-ness do we nowa-days fly un-der the same jaws for pro-tec-tion the um-brel-la be-ing a tent spread over the same bone But now for-get all about blinds and whiskers for a mo-ment and stand-ing in the Right Whale s mouth look around you afresh See-ing all the-se colon-nades of bone so me-thod-i-cal-ly ranged about would you not think you were in-side of the great Haar-lem or-gan and gaz-ing up-on its thou-sand pipes For a car-pet to the or-gan we have a rug of the soft-est Turkey the tongue which is glued as it were to the floor of the mouth It is very fat and ten-der and apt to tear in pieces in hoist-ing it on deck This par-tic-u-lar tongue now be-fore us at a pass-ing glance I should say it was a six bar-rel-er that is it will yield you about that amount of oil Ere this you must have plain-ly seen the truth of what I start-ed with that the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale have al-most en-tire-ly dif-fer-ent heads To sum up then in the Right Whale s there is no great well of sperm no ivory teeth at all no long slen-der mandible of a low-er jaw like the Sperm Whale s Nor in the Sperm Whale are there any of those blinds of bone no huge low-er lip and scarce-ly any-thing of a tongue Again the Right Whale has two ex-ter-nal spout holes the Sperm Whale on-ly one Look your last now on the-se ven-er-a-ble hood-ed heads while they yet lie to-geth-er for one will soon sink un-record-ed in the sea the oth-er will not be very long in fol-low-ing Can you catch the ex-pres-sion of the Sperm Whale s there It is the same he died with on-ly some of the longer wrin-kles in the fore-head seem now fad-ed away I think his broad brow to be full of a prair-ie like placid-i-ty born of a spec-u-la-tive in-dif-fer-ence as to death But mark the oth-er head s ex-pres-sion See that amaz-ing low-er lip pressed by ac-ci-dent again-st the ves-sel s side so as firm-ly to em-brace the jaw Does not this whole head seem to speak of an enor-mous prac-ti-cal res-o-lu-tion in fac-ing death This Right Whale I take to have been a Sto-ic the Sperm Whale a Pla-to-ni-an who might have tak-en up Spinoza in his lat-ter years CHAPTER 76 The Bat-ter-ing Ram Ere quit-ting for the non-ce the Sperm Whale s head I would have you as a sen-si-ble phys-i-ol-o-gist sim-ply par-tic-u-lar-ly re-mark its front as-pect in all its com-pact-ed col-lect-ed-ness I would have you in-ves-ti-gate it now with the sole view of form-ing to your-self some un-ex-ag-ger-at-ed in-tel-li-gent es-ti-mate of what-ev-er bat-ter-ing ram pow-er may be lodged there Here is a vi-tal point for you must ei-ther sat-is-fac-to-ri-ly set-tle this mat-ter with your-self or for ev-er re-main an in-fi-del as to one of the most ap-palling but not the less true even-ts per-haps any-where to be found in all record-ed his-to-ry You ob-serve that in the or-di-nary swim-ming po-si-tion of the Sperm Whale the front of his head pre-sen-ts an al-most whol-ly ver-ti-cal plane to the wa-ter you ob-serve that the low-er part of that front slopes con-sid-er-ably back-wards so as to fur-nish more of a re-treat for the long sock-et which re-ceives the boom like low-er jaw you ob-serve that the mouth is en-tire-ly un-der the head much in the same way in-deed as though your own mouth were en-tire-ly un-der your chin More-over you ob-serve that the whale has no ex-ter-nal nose and that what nose he has his spout hole is on the top of his head you ob-serve that his eyes and ears are at the sides of his head near-ly one third of his en-tire length from the front Where-fore you must now have per-ceived that the front of the Sperm Whale s head is a dead blind wall with-out a sin-gle or-gan or ten-der promi-nence of any sort what-so-ev-er Fur-ther-more you are now to con-sid-er that on-ly in the ex-treme low-er back-ward slop-ing part of the front of the head is there the slight-est ves-tige of bone and not till you get near twen-ty feet from the fore-head do you come to the full cra-nial de-vel-op-ment So that this whole enor-mous bone-less mass is as one wad Fi-nal-ly though as will soon be re-vealed its con-tents part-ly com-prise the most del-i-cate oil yet you are now to be ap-prised of the na-ture of the sub-stance which so im-preg-nably in-vests all that ap-par-ent ef-fem-i-na-cy In some pre-vi-ous place I have de-scribed to you how the blub-ber wraps the body of the whale as the rind wraps an or-ange Just so with the head but with this dif-fer-ence about the head this en-velope though not so thick is of a bone-less tough-ness in-es-timable by any man who has not han-dled it The sever-est point-ed har-poon the sharpest lance dart-ed by the strongest hu-man arm im-po-tent-ly re-bounds from it It is as though the fore-head of the Sperm Whale were paved with hors-es hoofs I do not think that any sen-sa-tion lurks in it Be-think your-self al-so of an-oth-er thing When two large load-ed In-di-a-men chance to crowd and crush to-wards each oth-er in the docks what do the sailors do They do not sus-pend be-tween them at the point of com-ing con-tact any mere-ly hard sub-stance like iron or wood No they hold there a large round wad of tow and cork en-veloped in the thick-est and tough-est of ox hide That brave-ly and un-in-jured takes the jam which would have snapped all their oak-en hand-spikes and iron crow bars By it-self this suf-fi-cient-ly il-lus-trates the ob-vi-ous fact I drive at But sup-ple-men-tary to this it has hy-po-thet-i-cal-ly oc-curred to me that as or-di-nary fish pos-sess what is called a swim-ming blad-der in them ca-pa-ble at will of dis-ten-sion or con-trac-tion and as the Sperm Whale as far as I know has no such pro-vi-sion in him con-sid-er-ing too the oth-er-wise in-ex-pli-ca-ble man-ner in which he now de-press-es his head al-to-geth-er be-neath the sur-face and anon swims with it high el-e-vat-ed out of the wa-ter con-sid-er-ing the un-ob-struct-ed elas-tic-i-ty of its en-velope con-sid-er-ing the unique in-te-ri-or of his head it has hy-po-thet-i-cal-ly oc-curred to me I say that those mys-ti-cal lung celled hon-ey-combs there may pos-si-bly have some hith-er-to un-known and un-sus-pect-ed con-nex-ion with the out-er air so as to be sus-cep-ti-ble to at-mo-spher-ic dis-ten-sion and con-trac-tion If this be so fan-cy the ir-re-sistible-ness of that might to which the most im-pal-pa-ble and de-struc-tive of all el-e-men-ts con-tributes Now mark Un-erring-ly im-pelling this dead im-preg-nable un-in-jurable wall and this most buoy-ant thing with-in there swims be-hind it all a mass of tremen-dous life on-ly to be ad-e-quate-ly es-ti-mat-ed as piled wood is by the cord and all obe-di-ent to one vo-li-tion as the small-est in-sect So that when I shall here-after de-tail to you all the spe-cial-i-ties and con-cen-tra-tions of po-ten-cy ev-ery-where lurk-ing in this ex-pan-sive mon-ster when I shall show you some of his more in-con-sid-er-able brain-ing feats I trust you will have re-nounced all ig-no-rant in-creduli-ty and be ready to abide by this that though the Sperm Whale stove a pas-sage through the Isth-mus of Darien and mixed the At-lantic with the Paci-fic you would not el-e-vate one hair of your eye brow For un-less you own the whale you are but a provin-cial and sen-ti-men-tal-ist in Truth But clear Truth is a thing for sala-man-der gi-ants on-ly to en-coun-ter how small the chances for the provin-cials then What be-fell the weak-ling youth lift-ing the dread god-dess s veil at Lais CHAPTER 77 The Great Hei-del-burgh Tun Now comes the Bal-ing of the Case But to com-pre-hend it aright you must know some-thing of the cu-ri-ous in-ter-nal struc-ture of the thing op-er-at-ed up-on Re-gard-ing the Sperm Whale s head as a solid ob-long you may on an in-clined plane side-ways di-vide it in-to two quoins where-of the low-er is the bony struc-ture form-ing the cra-ni-um and jaws and the up-per an unc-tu-ous mass whol-ly free from bones its broad for-ward end form-ing the ex-pand-ed ver-ti-cal ap-par-ent fore-head of the whale At the mid-dle of the fore-head hor-i-zon-tal-ly sub-di-vide this up-per quoin and then you have two al-most equal parts which be-fore were nat-u-ral-ly di-vid-ed by an in-ter-nal wall of a thick tendi-nous sub-stance Quoin is not a Eu-clidean term It be-longs to the pure nau-ti-cal math-e-mat-ics I know not that it has been de-fined be-fore A quoin is a solid which dif-fers from a wedge in hav-ing its sharp end formed by the steep in-cli-na-tion of one side in-stead of the mu-tu-al ta-per-ing of both sides The low-er sub-di-vid-ed part called the junk is one im-mense hon-ey-comb of oil formed by the cross-ing and re-cross-ing in-to ten thou-sand in-fil-trat-ed cel-ls of tough elas-tic white fi-bres through-out its whole ex-tent The up-per part known as the Case may be re-gard-ed as the great Hei-del-burgh Tun of the Sperm Whale And as that fa-mous great tierce is mys-ti-cal-ly carved in front so the whale s vast plait-ed fore-head for-ms in-nu-mer-able strange de-vices for the em-blem-at-i-cal adorn-ment of his won-drous tun More-over as that of Hei-del-burgh was al-ways re-plen-ished with the most ex-cel-lent of the wines of the Rhen-ish val-leys so the tun of the whale con-tains by far the most pre-cious of all his oily vin-tages name-ly the high-ly prized sper-ma-ceti in its ab-so-lute-ly pure limpid and odor-if-er-ous state Nor is this pre-cious sub-stance found un-al-loyed in any oth-er part of the crea-ture Though in life it re-mains per-fect-ly flu-id yet up-on ex-po-sure to the air af-ter death it soon be-gins to con-crete send-ing forth beau-ti-ful crys-talline shoots as when the first thin del-i-cate ice is just form-ing in wa-ter A large whale s case gen-er-al-ly yields about five hun-dred gal-lons of sperm though from un-avoid-able cir-cum-stances con-sid-er-able of it is spilled leaks and drib-bles away or is oth-er-wise ir-re-vo-ca-bly lost in the tick-lish busi-ness of se-cur-ing what you can I know not with what fine and cost-ly ma-te-ri-al the Hei-del-burgh Tun was coat-ed with-in but in su-perla-tive rich-ness that coat-ing could not pos-si-bly have com-pared with the silken pearl coloured mem-brane like the lin-ing of a fine pelis-se form-ing the in-ner sur-face of the Sperm Whale s case It will have been seen that the Hei-del-burgh Tun of the Sperm Whale em-braces the en-tire length of the en-tire top of the head and since as has been else-where set forth the head em-braces one third of the whole length of the crea-ture then set-ting that length down at eighty feet for a good sized whale you have more than twen-ty six feet for the depth of the tun when it is length-wise hoist-ed up and down again-st a ship s side As in de-cap-i-tat-ing the whale the op-er-a-tor s in-stru-ment is brought close to the spot where an en-trance is sub-se-quent-ly forced in-to the sper-ma-ceti mag-a-zine he has there-fore to be un-com-mon-ly heed-ful lest a care-less un-time-ly stroke should in-vade the sanc-tu-ary and wast-ing-ly let out its in-valu-able con-tents It is this de-cap-i-tat-ed end of the head al-so which is at last el-e-vat-ed out of the wa-ter and re-tained in that po-si-tion by the enor-mous cut-ting tack-les whose hempen com-bi-na-tions on one side make quite a wilder-ness of ropes in that quar-ter Thus much be-ing said at-tend now I pray you to that mar-vel-lous and in this par-tic-u-lar in-stance al-most fa-tal op-er-a-tion where-by the Sperm Whale s great Hei-del-burgh Tun is tapped CHAPTER 78 Cis-tern and Buck-ets Nim-ble as a cat Tashte-go moun-ts aloft and with-out al-ter-ing his erect pos-ture runs straight out up-on the over-hang-ing main-yard arm to the part where it ex-act-ly pro-jec-ts over the hoist-ed Tun He has car-ried with him a light tack-le called a whip con-sist-ing of on-ly two parts trav-el-ling through a sin-gle sheaved block Se-cur-ing this block so that it hangs down from the yard arm he swings one end of the rope till it is caught and firm-ly held by a hand on deck Then hand over hand down the oth-er part the In-di-an drops through the air till dex-ter-ous-ly he lands on the sum-mit of the head There still high el-e-vat-ed above the rest of the com-pa-ny to whom he vi-va-cious-ly cries he seems some Turk-ish Muezzin call-ing the good peo-ple to prayers from the top of a tow-er A short han-dled sharp spade be-ing sent up to him he dili-gent-ly search-es for the prop-er place to be-gin break-ing in-to the Tun In this busi-ness he pro-ceeds very heed-ful-ly like a trea-sure hunter in some old house sound-ing the wal-ls to find where the gold is ma-soned in By the time this cau-tious search is over a stout iron bound buck-et pre-cise-ly like a well buck-et has been at-tached to one end of the whip while the oth-er end be-ing stretched across the deck is there held by two or three alert hands Th-e-se last now hoist the buck-et with-in grasp of the In-di-an to whom an-oth-er per-son has reached up a very long pole Insert-ing this pole in-to the buck-et Tashte-go down-ward guides the buck-et in-to the Tun till it en-tire-ly dis-ap-pears then giv-ing the word to the sea-men at the whip up comes the buck-et again all bub-bling like a dairy maid s pail of new milk Care-ful-ly low-ered from its height the full freight-ed ves-sel is caught by an ap-point-ed hand and quick-ly emp-tied in-to a large tub Then re-mount-ing aloft it again goes through the same round un-til the deep cis-tern will yield no more Towards the end Tashte-go has to ram his long pole hard-er and hard-er and deep-er and deep-er in-to the Tun un-til some twen-ty feet of the pole have gone down Now the peo-ple of the Pe-quod had been bal-ing some time in this way sev-er-al tubs had been filled with the fra-grant sperm when all at on-ce a queer ac-ci-dent hap-pened Whether it was that Tashte-go that wild In-di-an was so heed-less and reck-less as to let go for a mo-ment his one hand-ed hold on the great ca-bled tack-les sus-pend-ing the head or whether the place where he stood was so treach-er-ous and oozy or whether the Evil One him-self would have it to fall out so with-out stat-ing his par-tic-u-lar rea-sons how it was ex-act-ly there is no telling now but on a sud-den as the eight-i-eth or nineti-eth buck-et came suck-ing-ly up my God poor Tashte-go like the twin re-cip-ro-cat-ing buck-et in a ver-i-ta-ble well dropped head fore-most down in-to this great Tun of Hei-del-burgh and with a hor-ri-ble oily gur-gling went clean out of sight  Man over-board  cried Dag-goo who amid the gen-er-al con-ster-na-tion first came to his sens-es  Swing the buck-et this way  and putting one foot in-to it so as the bet-ter to se-cure his slip-pery hand hold on the whip it-self the hois-ters ran him high up to the top of the head al-most be-fore Tashte-go could have reached its in-te-ri-or bot-tom Mean-time there was a ter-ri-ble tu-mult Look-ing over the side they saw the be-fore life-less head throb-bing and heav-ing just be-low the sur-face of the sea as if that mo-ment seized with some mo-men-tous idea where-as it was on-ly the poor In-di-an un-con-scious-ly re-veal-ing by those strug-gles the per-ilous depth to which he had sunk At this in-stant while Dag-goo on the sum-mit of the head was clear-ing the whip which had some-how got foul of the great cut-ting tack-les a sharp crack-ing noise was heard and to the un-speak-able hor-ror of all one of the two enor-mous hooks sus-pend-ing the head tore out and with a vast vi-bra-tion the enor-mous mass side-ways swung till the drunk ship reeled and shook as if smit-ten by an ice-berg The one re-main-ing hook up-on which the en-tire strain now de-pend-ed seemed ev-ery in-stant to be on the point of giv-ing way an event still more like-ly from the vi-o-lent mo-tions of the head  Come down come down  yelled the sea-men to Dag-goo but with one hand hold-ing on to the heavy tack-les so that if the head should drop he would still re-main sus-pend-ed the ne-gro hav-ing cleared the foul line rammed down the buck-et in-to the now col-lapsed well mean-ing that the buried har-pooneer should grasp it and so be hoist-ed out  In heav-en s name man  cried Stubb  are you ram-ming home a car-tridge there  Avast How will that help him jam-ming that iron bound buck-et on top of his head Avast will ye   Stand clear of the tack-le  cried a voice like the burst-ing of a rock-et Al-most in the same in-stant with a thun-der boom the enor-mous mass dropped in-to the sea like Ni-a-gara s Table Rock in-to the whirlpool the sud-den-ly re-lieved hull rolled away from it to far down her glit-ter-ing cop-per and all caught their breath as half swing-ing now over the sailors heads and now over the wa-ter Dag-goo through a thick mist of spray was dim-ly be-held cling-ing to the pen-du-lous tack-les while poor buried alive Tashte-go was sink-ing ut-ter-ly down to the bot-tom of the sea But hard-ly had the blind-ing va-por cleared away when a naked fig-ure with a board-ing sword in his hand was for one swift mo-ment seen hov-er-ing over the bul-warks The next a loud splash an-nounced that my brave Quee-queg had dived to the res-cue One packed rush was made to the side and ev-ery eye count-ed ev-ery rip-ple as mo-ment fol-lowed mo-ment and no sign of ei-ther the sinker or the di-ver could be seen Some hands now jumped in-to a boat alongside and pushed a lit-tle off from the ship  Ha ha  cried Dag-goo all at on-ce from his now qui-et swing-ing per-ch over-head and look-ing fur-ther off from the side we saw an arm thrust up-right from the blue waves a sight strange to see as an arm thrust forth from the grass over a grave  Both both  it is both   cried Dag-goo again with a joy-ful shout and soon af-ter Quee-queg was seen bold-ly strik-ing out with one hand and with the oth-er clutch-ing the long hair of the In-di-an Drawn in-to the wait-ing boat they were quick-ly brought to the deck but Tashte-go was long in com-ing to and Quee-queg did not look very brisk Now how had this no-ble res-cue been ac-com-plished Why div-ing af-ter the slow-ly de-scend-ing head Quee-queg with his keen sword had made side lunges near its bot-tom so as to scut-tle a large hole there then drop-ping his sword had thrust his long arm far in-wards and up-wards and so hauled out poor Tash by the head He averred that up-on first thrust-ing in for him a leg was pre-sent-ed but well know-ing that that was not as it ought to be and might oc-ca-sion great trou-ble  he had thrust back the leg and by a dex-ter-ous heave and toss had wrought a som-er-set up-on the In-di-an so that with the next tri-al he came forth in the good old way head fore-most As for the great head it-self that was do-ing as well as could be ex-pect-ed And thus through the courage and great skill in ob-stet-rics of Quee-queg the de-liv-er-ance or rather de-liv-ery of Tashte-go was suc-cess-ful-ly ac-com-plished in the teeth too of the most un-to-ward and ap-par-ent-ly hope-less im-ped-i-men-ts which is a lesson by no means to be for-got-ten Mid-wifery should be taught in the same course with fenc-ing and box-ing rid-ing and row-ing I know that this queer ad-ven-ture of the Gay Head-er s will be sure to seem in-cred-i-ble to some lands-men though they them-selves may have ei-ther seen or heard of some one s falling in-to a cis-tern ashore an ac-ci-dent which not sel-dom hap-pens and with much less rea-son too than the In-di-an s con-sid-er-ing the ex-ceed-ing slip-per-i-ness of the curb of the Sperm Whale s well But per-ad-ven-ture it may be saga-cious-ly urged how is this We thought the tis-sued in-fil-trat-ed head of the Sperm Whale was the light-est and most corky part about him and yet thou makest it sink in an el-e-ment of a far greater speci-fic grav-i-ty than it-self We have thee there Not at all but I have ye for at the time poor Tash fell in the case had been near-ly emp-tied of its lighter con-tents leav-ing lit-tle but the dense tendi-nous wall of the well a dou-ble weld-ed ham-mered sub-stance as I have be-fore said much heav-ier than the sea wa-ter and a lump of which sinks in it like lead al-most But the ten-den-cy to rapid sink-ing in this sub-stance was in the pre-sent in-stance ma-te-ri-al-ly coun-ter-act-ed by the oth-er parts of the head re-main-ing un-de-tached from it so that it sank very slow-ly and de-lib-er-ate-ly in-deed af-ford-ing Quee-queg a fair chance for per-form-ing his ag-ile ob-stet-rics on the run as you may say Yes it was a run-ning de-liv-ery so it was Now had Tashte-go per-ished in that head it had been a very pre-cious per-ish-ing smoth-ered in the very whitest and dain-ti-est of fra-grant sper-ma-ceti coffined hearsed and tombed in the se-cret in-ner cham-ber and sanc-tum sanc-to-rum of the whale On-ly one sweet-er end can read-i-ly be re-called the de-li-cious death of an Ohio hon-ey hunter who seek-ing hon-ey in the crotch of a hol-low tree found such ex-ceed-ing store of it that lean-ing too far over it sucked him in so that he died em-balmed How many think ye have like-wise fal-l-en in-to Pla-to s hon-ey head and sweet-ly per-ished there CHAPTER 79 The Prair-ie To scan the lines of his face or feel the bumps on the head of this Le-viathan this is a thing which no Phys-iog-nomist or Phre-nol-o-gist has as yet un-der-tak-en Such an en-ter-prise would seem al-most as hope-ful as for La-vater to have scru-ti-nized the wrin-kles on the Rock of Gi-bral-tar or for Gall to have mount-ed a lad-der and ma-nip-u-lat-ed the Dome of the Pan-theon Still in that fa-mous work of his La-vater not on-ly treats of the var-i-ous faces of men but al-so at-ten-tive-ly stud-ies the faces of hors-es birds ser-pen-ts and fish and dwells in de-tail up-on the mod-i-fi-ca-tions of ex-pres-sion dis-cernible there-in Nor have Gall and his dis-ci-ple Spurzheim failed to throw out some hin-ts touch-ing the phreno-log-i-cal char-ac-ter-is-tics of oth-er be-ings than man There-fore though I am but ill qual-i-fied for a pi-o-neer in the ap-pli-ca-tion of the-se two semi sci-ences to the whale I will do my en-deav-or I try all things I achieve what I can Phys-iog-nom-i-cal-ly re-gard-ed the Sperm Whale is an anoma-lous crea-ture He has no prop-er nose And since the nose is the cen-tral and most con-spic-u-ous of the fea-tures and since it per-haps most mod-i-fies and fi-nal-ly con-trols their com-bined ex-pres-sion hence it would seem that its en-tire ab-sence as an ex-ter-nal ap-pendage must very large-ly af-fect the coun-te-nance of the whale For as in land-scape gar-den-ing a spire cupo-la mon-u-ment or tow-er of some sort is deemed al-most in-dis-pens-able to the com-ple-tion of the scene so no face can be phys-iog-nom-i-cal-ly in keep-ing with-out the el-e-vat-ed open work bel-fry of the nose Dash the nose from Phidi-as s mar-ble Jove and what a sor-ry re-main-der Nev-er-the-less Le-viathan is of so mighty a mag-ni-tude all his pro-por-tions are so state-ly that the same de-fi-cien-cy which in the sculp-tured Jove were hideous in him is no blem-ish at all Nay it is an added grandeur A nose to the whale would have been im-per-ti-nent As on your phys-iog-nom-i-cal voy-age you sail round his vast head in your jol-ly boat your no-ble con-cep-tions of him are nev-er in-sult-ed by the re-flec-tion that he has a nose to be pulled A pesti-lent con-ceit which so of-ten will in-sist up-on ob-trud-ing even when be-hold-ing the might-i-est roy-al beadle on his throne In some par-tic-u-lars per-haps the most im-pos-ing phys-iog-nom-i-cal view to be had of the Sperm Whale is that of the full front of his head This as-pect is sub-lime In thought a fine hu-man brow is like the East when trou-bled with the morn-ing In the re-pose of the pas-ture the curled brow of the bull has a touch of the grand in it Push-ing heavy can-non up moun-tain de-files the ele-phan-t s brow is ma-jes-tic Hu-man or an-i-mal the mys-ti-cal brow is as that great gold-en seal af-fixed by the Ger-man em-per-ors to their de-crees It sig-ni-fies  God done this day by my hand  But in most crea-tures nay in man him-self very of-ten the brow is but a mere strip of alpine land ly-ing along the snow line Few are the fore-heads which like Shake-speare s or Me-lanc-thon s rise so high and de-scend so low that the eyes them-selves seem clear eter-nal tide-less moun-tain lakes and all above them in the fore-head s wrin-kles you seem to track the antlered thoughts de-scend-ing there to drink as the High-land hunters track the snow prints of the deer But in the great Sperm Whale this high and mighty god like dig-ni-ty in-her-ent in the brow is so im-mense-ly am-pli-fied that gaz-ing on it in that full front view you feel the De-ity and the dread pow-ers more forcibly than in be-hold-ing any oth-er ob-ject in liv-ing na-ture For you see no one point pre-cise-ly not one dis-tinct fea-ture is re-vealed no nose eyes ears or mouth no face he has none prop-er noth-ing but that one broad fir-ma-ment of a fore-head pleat-ed with rid-dles dumb-ly low-er-ing with the doom of boats and ships and men Nor in pro-file does this won-drous brow di-min-ish though that way viewed its grandeur does not dom-i-neer up-on you so In pro-file you plain-ly per-ceive that hor-i-zon-tal semi cres-cen-tic de-pres-sion in the fore-head s mid-dle which in man is La-vater s mark of ge-nius But how Ge-nius in the Sperm Whale Has the Sperm Whale ev-er writ-ten a book spo-ken a speech No his great ge-nius is de-clared in his do-ing noth-ing par-tic-u-lar to prove it It is more-over de-clared in his pyra-midi-cal si-lence And this re-minds me that had the great Sperm Whale been known to the young Ori-ent World he would have been de-i-fied by their child ma-gian thoughts They de-i-fied the crocodile of the Nile be-cause the crocodile is tongue-less and the Sperm Whale has no tongue or at least it is so ex-ceed-ing-ly small as to be in-ca-pable of pro-tru-sion If here-after any high-ly cul-tured po-et-i-cal na-tion shall lure back to their birth right the mer-ry May day gods of old and liv-ing-ly en-throne them again in the now ego-tis-ti-cal sky in the now un-haunt-ed hill then be sure ex-alt-ed to Jove s high seat the great Sperm Whale shall lord it Cham-pol-lion de-ci-phered the wrin-kled gran-ite hi-ero-glyph-ics But there is no Cham-pol-lion to de-ci-pher the Egypt of ev-ery man s and ev-ery be-ing s face Phys-iog-no-my like ev-ery oth-er hu-man sci-ence is but a pass-ing fa-ble If then Sir Wil-liam Jones who read in thir-ty lan-guages could not read the sim-plest peas-an-t s face in its pro-founder and more sub-tle mean-ings how may un-let-tered Ish-mael hope to read the aw-ful Chaldee of the Sperm Whale s brow I but put that brow be-fore you Read it if you can CHAPTER 8 The Nut If the Sperm Whale be phys-iog-nom-i-cal-ly a Sphinx to the phre-nol-o-gist his brain seems that ge-o-met-ri-cal cir-cle which it is im-pos-si-ble to square In the full grown crea-ture the skull will mea-sure at least twen-ty feet in length Un-hinge the low-er jaw and the side view of this skull is as the side of a mod-er-ate-ly in-clined plane rest-ing through-out on a lev-el base But in life as we have else-where seen this in-clined plane is an-gu-lar-ly filled up and al-most squared by the enor-mous su-per-in-cum-bent mass of the junk and sperm At the high end the skull for-ms a crater to bed that part of the mass while un-der the long floor of this crater in an-oth-er cav-i-ty sel-dom ex-ceed-ing ten inch-es in length and as many in depth re-pos-es the mere hand-ful of this mon-ster s brain The brain is at least twen-ty feet from his ap-par-ent fore-head in life it is hid-den away be-hind its vast out-works like the in-ner-most citadel with-in the am-pli-fied for-ti-fi-ca-tions of Que-bec So like a choice cas-ket is it se-cret-ed in him that I have known some whale-men who peremp-to-ri-ly deny that the Sperm Whale has any oth-er brain than that pal-pa-ble sem-blance of one formed by the cu-bic yards of his sperm mag-a-zine Ly-ing in strange folds cours-es and con-vo-lu-tions to their ap-pre-hen-sions it seems more in keep-ing with the idea of his gen-er-al might to re-gard that mys-tic part of him as the seat of his in-tel-li-gence It is plain then that phreno-log-i-cal-ly the head of this Le-viathan in the crea-ture s liv-ing in-tact state is an en-tire delu-sion As for his true brain you can then see no in-di-ca-tions of it nor feel any The whale like all things that are mighty wears a false brow to the com-mon world If you un-load his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view of its rear end which is the high end you will be struck by its re-sem-blance to the hu-man skull be-held in the same sit-u-a-tion and from the same point of view In-deed place this re-versed skull scaled down to the hu-man mag-ni-tude among a plate of men s skul-ls and you would in-vol-un-tar-i-ly con-found it with them and re-mark-ing the de-pres-sions on one part of its sum-mit in phreno-log-i-cal phrase you would say This man had no self es-teem and no ven-er-a-tion And by those nega-tions con-sid-ered along with the af-fir-ma-tive fact of his prodi-gious bulk and pow-er you can best form to your-self the truest though not the most ex-hil-a-rat-ing con-cep-tion of what the most ex-alt-ed po-ten-cy is But if from the com-par-a-tive di-men-sions of the whale s prop-er brain you deem it in-ca-pable of be-ing ad-e-quate-ly chart-ed then I have an-oth-er idea for you If you at-ten-tive-ly re-gard al-most any quadruped s spine you will be struck with the re-sem-blance of its ver-te-br to a strung neck-lace of dwarfed skul-ls all bear-ing rudi-men-tal re-sem-blance to the skull prop-er It is a Ger-man con-ceit that the ver-te-br are ab-so-lute-ly un-de-vel-oped skul-ls But the cu-ri-ous ex-ter-nal re-sem-blance I take it the Ger-mans were not the first men to per-ceive A for-eign friend on-ce point-ed it out to me in the skele-ton of a foe he had slain and with the ver-te-br of which he was in-lay-ing in a sort of bas-so re-lievo the beaked prow of his ca-noe Now I con-sid-er that the phre-nol-o-gists have omit-ted an im-por-tant thing in not push-ing their in-ves-ti-ga-tions from the cere-bel-lum through the spinal canal For I be-lieve that much of a man s char-ac-ter will be found be-to-kened in his back-bone I would rather feel your spine than your skull who-ev-er you are A thin joist of a spine nev-er yet up-held a full and no-ble soul I re-joice in my spine as in the firm au-da-cious staff of that flag which I fling half out to the world Ap-ply this spinal branch of phrenol-o-gy to the Sperm Whale His cra-nial cav-i-ty is con-tin-u-ous with the first neck ver-te-bra and in that ver-te-bra the bot-tom of the spinal canal will mea-sure ten inch-es across be-ing eight in height and of a tri-an-gu-lar fig-ure with the base down-wards As it pass-es through the re-main-ing ver-te-br the canal ta-pers in size but for a con-sid-er-able dis-tance re-mains of large ca-pac-i-ty Now of course this canal is filled with much the same strange-ly fi-brous sub-stance the spinal cord as the brain and di-rect-ly com-mu-ni-cates with the brain And what is still more for many feet af-ter emerg-ing from the brain s cav-i-ty the spinal cord re-mains of an un-de-creas-ing girth al-most equal to that of the brain Un-der all the-se cir-cum-stances would it be un-rea-son-able to sur-vey and map out the whale s spine phreno-log-i-cal-ly For viewed in this light the won-der-ful com-par-a-tive small-ness of his brain prop-er is more than com-pen-sat-ed by the won-der-ful com-par-a-tive mag-ni-tude of his spinal cord But leav-ing this hint to op-er-ate as it may with the phre-nol-o-gists I would mere-ly as-sume the spinal the-o-ry for a mo-ment in ref-er-ence to the Sperm Whale s hump This au-gust hump if I mis-take not ris-es over one of the larg-er ver-te-br and is there-fore in some sort the out-er con-vex mould of it From its rel-a-tive sit-u-a-tion then I should call this high hump the or-gan of firm-ness or in-domitable-ness in the Sperm Whale And that the great mon-ster is in-domitable you will yet have rea-son to know CHAPTER 81 The Pe-quod Meets The Vir-gin The pre-des-ti-nat-ed day ar-rived and we du-ly met the ship Jungfrau Der-ick De Deer mas-ter of Bre-men At one time the great-est whal-ing peo-ple in the world the Dutch and Ger-mans are now among the least but here and there at very wide in-ter-vals of lat-i-tude and lon-gi-tude you still oc-ca-sion-al-ly meet with their flag in the Paci-fic For some rea-son the Jungfrau seemed quite ea-ger to pay her re-spec-ts While yet some dis-tance from the Pe-quod she round-ed to and drop-ping a boat her cap-tain was im-pelled to-wards us im-pa-tient-ly stand-ing in the bows in-stead of the stern  What has he in his hand there  cried Star-buck point-ing to some-thing wav-ing-ly held by the Ger-man  Im-pos-si-ble  a lamp feed-er   Not that  said Stubb  no no it s a cof-fee pot Mr Star-buck he s com-ing off to make us our cof-fee is the Yar-man don t you see that big tin can there alongside of him  that s his boil-ing wa-ter Oh he s all right is the Yar-man   Go along with you  cried Flask  it s a lamp feed-er and an oil can He s out of oil and has come a beg-ging  How-ev-er cu-ri-ous it may seem for an oil ship to be bor-row-ing oil on the whale ground and how-ev-er much it may in-vert-ed-ly con-tra-dict the old proverb about car-ry-ing coals to New-castle yet some-times such a thing re-al-ly hap-pens and in the pre-sent case Cap-tain Der-ick De Deer did in-du-bitably con-duct a lamp feed-er as Flask did de-clare As he mount-ed the deck Ahab abrupt-ly ac-cost-ed him with-out at all heed-ing what he had in his hand but in his bro-ken lin-go the Ger-man soon evinced his com-plete ig-no-rance of the White Whale im-me-di-ate-ly turn-ing the con-ver-sa-tion to his lamp feed-er and oil can with some re-marks touch-ing his hav-ing to turn in-to his ham-mock at night in pro-found dark-ness his last drop of Bre-men oil be-ing gone and not a sin-gle fly-ing fish yet cap-tured to sup-ply the de-fi-cien-cy con-clud-ing by hint-ing that his ship was in-deed what in the Fish-ery is tech-ni-cal-ly called a clean one that is an emp-ty one well de-serv-ing the name of Jungfrau or the Vir-gin His ne-ces-si-ties sup-plied Der-ick de-part-ed but he had not gained his ship s side when whales were al-most si-mul-ta-ne-ous-ly raised from the mast heads of both ves-sels and so ea-ger for the chase was Der-ick that with-out paus-ing to put his oil can and lamp feed-er aboard he slewed round his boat and made af-ter the leviathan lamp feed-ers Now the game hav-ing risen to lee-ward he and the oth-er three Ger-man boats that soon fol-lowed him had con-sid-er-ably the start of the Pe-quod s keels There were eight whales an av-er-age pod Aware of their dan-ger they were go-ing all abreast with great speed straight be-fore the wind rub-bing their flanks as close-ly as so many spans of hors-es in har-ness They left a great wide wake as though con-tin-u-al-ly un-rolling a great wide parch-ment up-on the sea Full in this rapid wake and many fath-oms in the rear swam a huge humped old bull which by his com-par-a-tive-ly slow pro-gress as well as by the un-usu-al yel-low-ish in-crus-ta-tions over-grow-ing him seemed af-flict-ed with the jaun-dice or some oth-er in-fir-mi-ty Whether this whale be-longed to the pod in ad-vance seemed ques-tion-able for it is not cus-tom-ary for such ven-er-a-ble leviathans to be at all so-cial Nev-er-the-less he stuck to their wake though in-deed their back wa-ter must have re-tard-ed him be-cause the white bone or swell at his broad muz-zle was a dashed one like the swell formed when two hos-tile cur-ren-ts meet His spout was short slow and la-bo-ri-ous com-ing forth with a chok-ing sort of gush and spend-ing it-self in torn shreds fol-lowed by strange sub-ter-ranean com-mo-tions in him which seemed to have egress at his oth-er buried ex-trem-i-ty caus-ing the wa-ters be-hind him to up-bub-ble  Who s got some pare-goric  said Stubb  he has the stom-ach ache I m afraid Lord think of hav-ing half an acre of stom-ach ache Ad-verse winds are hold-ing mad Christ-mas in him boys It s the first foul wind I ev-er knew to blow from astern but look did ev-er whale yaw so be-fore it must be he s lost his tiller  As an over-laden In-dia-man bear-ing down the Hin-dostan coast with a deck load of fright-ened hors-es ca-reens buries rol-ls and wal-lows on her way so did this old whale heave his aged bulk and now and then part-ly turn-ing over on his cum-brous rib ends ex-pose the cause of his de-vi-ous wake in the un-nat-u-ral stump of his star-board fin Whether he had lost that fin in bat-tle or had been born with-out it it were hard to say  On-ly wait a bit old chap and I ll give ye a sling for that wound-ed arm  cried cru-el Flask point-ing to the whale line near him  Mind he don t sling thee with it  cried Star-buck  Give way or the Ger-man will have him  With one in-tent all the com-bined ri-val boats were point-ed for this one fish be-cause not on-ly was he the largest and there-fore the most valu-able whale but he was near-est to them and the oth-er whales were go-ing with such great ve-loc-i-ty more-over as al-most to de-fy pur-suit for the time At this junc-ture the Pe-quod s keels had shot by the three Ger-man boats last low-ered but from the great start he had had Der-ick s boat still led the chase though ev-ery mo-ment neared by his for-eign ri-vals The on-ly thing they feared was that from be-ing al-ready so nigh to his mark he would be en-abled to dart his iron be-fore they could com-plete-ly over-take and pass him As for Der-ick he seemed quite con-fi-dent that this would be the case and oc-ca-sion-al-ly with a de-rid-ing ges-ture shook his lamp feed-er at the oth-er boats  The un-gra-cious and un-grate-ful dog  cried Star-buck  he mocks and dares me with the very poor box I filled for him not five min-utes ago   then in his old in-tense whis-per  Give way grey-hounds Dog to it   I tell ye what it is men  cried Stubb to his crew  it s again-st my re-li-gion to get mad but I d like to eat that vil-lain-ous Yar-man Pul-l won t ye Are ye go-ing to let that ras-cal beat ye Do ye love brandy A hogshead of brandy then to the best man Come why don t some of ye burst a blood ves-sel Who s that been drop-ping an an-chor over-board we don t budge an inch we re be-calmed Hal-loo here s grass grow-ing in the boat s bot-tom and by the Lord the mast there s bud-ding This won t do boys Look at that Yar-man The short and long of it is men will ye spit fire or not   Oh see the suds he makes  cried Flask danc-ing up and down  What a hump Oh do pile on the beef lays like a log Oh my lads do spring slap jacks and qua-hogs for sup-per you know my lad-s baked clams and muffin-s oh do do spring  he s a hun-dred bar-reller don t lose him now don t oh don t  see that Yar-man Oh won t ye pull for your duff my lad-s such a sog such a sog-ger Don t ye love sperm There goes three thou-sand dol-lars men  a bank  a whole bank The bank of Eng-land  Oh do do do  What s that Yar-man about now  At this mo-ment Der-ick was in the act of pitch-ing his lamp feed-er at the ad-vanc-ing boats and al-so his oil can per-haps with the dou-ble view of re-tard-ing his ri-val-s way and at the same time eco-nom-i-cal-ly ac-cel-er-at-ing his own by the mo-men-tary im-pe-tus of the back-ward toss  The un-man-ner-ly Dutch dog-ger  cried Stubb  Pull now men like fifty thou-sand line of bat-tle ship loads of red haired dev-ils What d ye say Tashte-go are you the man to snap your spine in two and twen-ty pieces for the hon-or of old Gay-head What d ye say   I say pull like god dam   cried the In-di-an Fierce-ly but even-ly in-cit-ed by the taunts of the Ger-man the Pe-quod s three boats now be-gan rang-ing al-most abreast and so dis-posed mo-men-tar-i-ly neared him In that fine loose chival-rous at-ti-tude of the heads-man when draw-ing near to his prey the three mates stood up proud-ly oc-ca-sion-al-ly back-ing the af-ter oars-man with an ex-hil-a-rat-ing cry of  There she slides now Hur-rah for the white ash breeze Down with the Yar-man Sail over him  But so de-cid-ed an orig-i-nal start had Der-ick had that spite of all their gal-lantry he would have proved the vic-tor in this race had not a righ-teous judg-ment de-scend-ed up-on him in a crab which caught the blade of his mid-ship oars-man While this clum-sy lub-ber was striv-ing to free his white ash and while in con-se-quence Der-ick s boat was nigh to cap-siz-ing and he thun-der-ing away at his men in a mighty rage  that was a good time for Star-buck Stubb and Flask With a shout they took a mor-tal start for-wards and slant-ing-ly ranged up on the Ger-man s quar-ter An in-stant more and all four boats were di-ag-o-ni-cal-ly in the whale s im-me-di-ate wake while stretch-ing from them on both sides was the foam-ing swell that he made It was a ter-ri-fic most pitiable and mad-den-ing sight The whale was now go-ing head out and send-ing his spout be-fore him in a con-tin-u-al tor-ment-ed jet while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of fright Now to this hand now to that he yawed in his fal-ter-ing flight and still at ev-ery bil-low that he broke he spas-mod-i-cal-ly sank in the sea or side-ways rolled to-wards the sky his one beat-ing fin So have I seen a bird with clipped wing mak-ing af-fright-ed bro-ken cir-cles in the air vain-ly striv-ing to es-cape the pi-rat-i-cal hawks But the bird has a voice and with plain-tive cries will make known her fear but the fear of this vast dumb brute of the sea was chained up and en-chant-ed in him he had no voice save that chok-ing res-pi-ra-tion through his spir-a-cle and this made the sight of him un-speak-ably pitiable while still in his amaz-ing bulk portcullis jaw and om-nipo-tent tail there was enough to ap-pal the stoutest man who so pitied See-ing now that but a very few mo-men-ts more would give the Pe-quod s boats the ad-van-tage and rather than be thus foiled of his game Der-ick chose to haz-ard what to him must have seemed a most un-usu-al-ly long dart ere the last chance would for ev-er es-cape But no soon-er did his har-pooneer stand up for the stroke than all three tiger-s Quee-queg Tashte-go Dag-goo in-stinc-tive-ly sprang to their feet and stand-ing in a di-ag-o-nal row si-mul-ta-ne-ous-ly point-ed their bar-bs and dart-ed over the head of the Ger-man har-pooneer their three Nan-tuck-et irons en-tered the whale Blind-ing va-pors of foam and white fire The three boats in the first fury of the whale s head-long rush bumped the Ger-man s aside with such force that both Der-ick and his baf-fled har-pooneer were spilled out and sailed over by the three fly-ing keels  Don t be afraid my but-ter box-es  cried Stubb cast-ing a pass-ing glance up-on them as he shot by  ye ll be picked up present-ly all right I saw some sharks aster-n St Bernard s dogs you know re-lieve dis-tressed trav-ellers Hur-rah this is the way to sail now Every keel a sun-beam Hur-rah  Here we go like three tin ket-tles at the tail of a mad cougar This puts me in mind of fas-ten-ing to an ele-phant in a tilbury on a plain makes the wheel spokes fly boys when you fas-ten to him that way and there s dan-ger of be-ing pitched out too when you strike a hill Hur-rah this is the way a fel-low feels when he s go-ing to Davy Jones all a rush down an end-less in-clined plane Hur-rah this whale car-ries the ev-er-last-ing mail  But the mon-ster s run was a brief one Giv-ing a sud-den gasp he tu-mul-tuous-ly sound-ed With a grat-ing rush the three lines flew round the log-ger-heads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them while so fear-ful were the har-pooneers that this rapid sound-ing would soon ex-haust the lines that us-ing all their dex-ter-ous might they caught re-peat-ed smok-ing turns with the rope to hold on till at last ow-ing to the per-pen-dic-u-lar strain from the lead lined chocks of the boats whence the three ropes went straight down in-to the blue the gun-wales of the bows were al-most even with the wa-ter while the three sterns tilt-ed high in the air And the whale soon ceas-ing to sound for some time they re-mained in that at-ti-tude fear-ful of ex-pend-ing more line though the po-si-tion was a lit-tle tick-lish But though boats have been tak-en down and lost in this way yet it is this  hold-ing on  as it is called this hook-ing up by the sharp bar-bs of his live flesh from the back this it is that of-ten tor-men-ts the Le-viathan in-to soon ris-ing again to meet the sharp lance of his foes Yet not to speak of the per-il of the thing it is to be doubt-ed whether this course is al-ways the best for it is but rea-son-able to pre-sume that the longer the strick-en whale stays un-der wa-ter the more he is ex-haust-ed Be-cause ow-ing to the enor-mous sur-face of him in a full grown sperm whale some-thing less than 2 square feet the pres-sure of the wa-ter is im-mense We all know what an as-ton-ish-ing at-mo-spher-ic weight we our-selves stand up un-der even here above ground in the air how vast then the bur-den of a whale bear-ing on his back a column of two hun-dred fath-oms of ocean It must at least equal the weight of fifty at-mo-spheres One whale-man has es-ti-mat-ed it at the weight of twen-ty line of bat-tle ships with all their guns and stores and men on board As the three boats lay there on that gen-tly rolling sea gaz-ing down in-to its eter-nal blue noon and as not a sin-gle groan or cry of any sort nay not so much as a rip-ple or a bub-ble came up from its depths what lands-man would have thought that be-neath all that si-lence and placid-i-ty the ut-most mon-ster of the seas was writhing and wrench-ing in agony Not eight inch-es of per-pen-dic-u-lar rope were vis-i-ble at the bows Seems it cred-i-ble that by three such thin threads the great Le-viathan was sus-pend-ed like the big weight to an eight day clock Sus-pend-ed and to what To three bits of board Is this the crea-ture of whom it was on-ce so tri-umphant-ly said  Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons or his head with fish spears The sword of him that layeth at him can-not hold the spear the dart nor the haber-geon he es-teemeth iron as straw the ar-row can-not make him flee darts are count-ed as stub-ble he laugh-eth at the shak-ing of a spear  This the crea-ture this he Oh that un-ful-fil-men-ts should fol-low the prophets For with the strength of a thou-sand thighs in his tail Le-viathan had run his head un-der the moun-tains of the sea to hide him from the Pe-quod s fish spears In that slop-ing af-ter-noon sun-light the shad-ows that the three boats sent down be-neath the sur-face must have been long enough and broad enough to shade half Xerx-es army Who can tell how ap-palling to the wound-ed whale must have been such huge phan-toms flit-ting over his head  Stand by men he stirs  cried Star-buck as the three lines sud-den-ly vi-brat-ed in the wa-ter dis-tinct-ly con-duct-ing up-wards to them as by mag-net-ic wires the life and death throbs of the whale so that ev-ery oars-man felt them in his seat The next mo-ment re-lieved in great part from the down-ward strain at the bows the boats gave a sud-den bounce up-wards as a small ice-field will when a dense herd of white bears are scared from it in-to the sea  Haul in Haul in  cried Star-buck again  he s ris-ing  The lines of which hard-ly an in-stant be-fore not one hand s breadth could have been gained were now in long quick coils flung back all drip-ping in-to the boats and soon the whale broke wa-ter with-in two ship s lengths of the hunters His mo-tions plain-ly de-not-ed his ex-treme ex-haus-tion In most land an-i-mals there are cer-tain valves or flood gates in many of their veins where-by when wound-ed the blood is in some de-gree at least in-stant-ly shut off in cer-tain di-rec-tions Not so with the whale one of whose pe-cu-liar-i-ties it is to have an en-tire non valvu-lar struc-ture of the blood ves-sels so that when pierced even by so small a point as a har-poon a dead-ly drain is at on-ce be-gun up-on his whole ar-te-ri-al sys-tem and when this is height-ened by the ex-traor-di-nary pres-sure of wa-ter at a great dis-tance be-low the sur-face his life may be said to pour from him in in-ces-sant streams Yet so vast is the quan-ti-ty of blood in him and so dis-tant and nu-mer-ous its in-te-ri-or foun-tains that he will keep thus bleed-ing and bleed-ing for a con-sid-er-able pe-ri-od even as in a drought a river will flow whose source is in the well springs of far off and undis-cernible hills Even now when the boats pulled up-on this whale and per-ilous-ly drew over his sway-ing flukes and the lances were dart-ed in-to him they were fol-lowed by steady jets from the new made wound which kept con-tin-u-al-ly play-ing while the nat-u-ral spout hole in his head was on-ly at in-ter-vals how-ev-er rapid send-ing its af-fright-ed mois-ture in-to the air From this last vent no blood yet came be-cause no vi-tal part of him had thus far been struck His life as they sig-nif-i-cant-ly call it was un-touched As the boats now more close-ly sur-round-ed him the whole up-per part of his form with much of it that is or-di-nar-i-ly sub-merged was plain-ly re-vealed His eyes or rather the places where his eyes had been were be-held As strange mis-grown mass-es gath-er in the knot holes of the no-blest oaks when pros-trate so from the points which the whale s eyes had on-ce oc-cu-pied now pro-trud-ed blind bul-bs hor-ri-bly pitiable to see But pity there was none For all his old age and his one arm and his blind eyes he must die the death and be mur-dered in or-der to light the gay bridals and oth-er mer-ry mak-ings of men and al-so to il-lu-mi-nate the solemn church-es that preach un-con-di-tion-al in-of-fen-sive-ness by all to all Still rolling in his blood at last he par-tial-ly dis-closed a strange-ly dis-coloured bunch or pro-tu-ber-ance the size of a bushel low down on the flank  A nice spot  cried Flask  just let me prick him there on-ce   Avast  cried Star-buck  there s no need of that  But hu-mane Star-buck was too late At the in-stant of the dart an ul-cer-ous jet shot from this cru-el wound and goad-ed by it in-to more than suf-fer-able an-guish the whale now spout-ing thick blood with swift fury blind-ly dart-ed at the craft be-spat-ter-ing them and their glo-ry-ing crews all over with show-ers of gore cap-siz-ing Flask s boat and mar-ring the bows It was his death stroke For by this time so spent was he by loss of blood that he help-less-ly rolled away from the wreck he had made lay pant-ing on his side im-po-tent-ly flapped with his stumped fin then over and over slow-ly re-volved like a wan-ing world turned up the white se-crets of his bel-ly lay like a log and died It was most piteous that last ex-pir-ing spout As when by un-seen hands the wa-ter is grad-u-al-ly drawn off from some mighty foun-tain and with half sti-fled melan-choly gur-glings the spray column low-ers and low-ers to the ground so the last long dy-ing spout of the whale Soon while the crews were await-ing the ar-rival of the ship the body showed symp-toms of sink-ing with all its trea-sures un-ri-fled Im-me-di-ate-ly by Star-buck s or-ders lines were se-cured to it at dif-fer-ent points so that ere long ev-ery boat was a buoy the sunken whale be-ing sus-pend-ed a few inch-es be-neath them by the cords By very heed-ful man-age-ment when the ship drew nigh the whale was trans-ferred to her side and was strong-ly se-cured there by the stiffest fluke chains for it was plain that un-less ar-ti-fi-cial-ly up-held the body would at on-ce sink to the bot-tom It so chanced that al-most up-on first cut-ting in-to him with the spade the en-tire length of a cor-rod-ed har-poon was found imbed-ded in his flesh on the low-er part of the bunch be-fore de-scribed But as the stumps of har-poons are fre-quent-ly found in the dead bod-ies of cap-tured whales with the flesh per-fect-ly healed around them and no promi-nence of any kind to de-note their place there-fore there must needs have been some oth-er un-known rea-son in the pre-sent case ful-ly to ac-count for the ul-cer-a-tion al-lud-ed to But still more cu-ri-ous was the fact of a lance head of stone be-ing found in him not far from the buried iron the flesh per-fect-ly firm about it Who had dart-ed that stone lance And when It might have been dart-ed by some Nor West In-di-an long be-fore Amer-i-ca was dis-cov-ered What oth-er mar-vels might have been rum-maged out of this mon-strous cab-i-net there is no telling But a sud-den stop was put to fur-ther dis-cov-er-ies by the ship s be-ing un-prece-dent-ed-ly dragged over side-ways to the sea ow-ing to the body s im-mense-ly in-creas-ing ten-den-cy to sink How-ev-er Star-buck who had the or-der-ing of af-fairs hung on to it to the last hung on to it so res-o-lute-ly in-deed that when at length the ship would have been cap-sized if still per-sist-ing in lock-ing ar-ms with the body then when the com-mand was given to break clear from it such was the im-mov-able strain up-on the tim-ber heads to which the fluke chains and ca-bles were fas-tened that it was im-pos-si-ble to cast them off Mean-time ev-ery-thing in the Pe-quod was aslant To cross to the oth-er side of the deck was like walk-ing up the steep gabled roof of a house The ship groaned and gasped Many of the ivory in-lay-ings of her bul-warks and cab-ins were start-ed from their places by the un-nat-u-ral dis-lo-ca-tion In vain hand-spikes and crows were brought to bear up-on the im-mov-able fluke chains to pry them adrift from the tim-ber-heads and so low had the whale now set-tled that the sub-merged ends could not be at all ap-proached while ev-ery mo-ment whole tons of pon-deros-i-ty seemed added to the sink-ing bulk and the ship seemed on the point of go-ing over  Hold on hold on won t ye  cried Stubb to the body  don t be in such a dev-il of a hur-ry to sink By thun-der men we must do some-thing or go for it No use pry-ing there avast I say with your hand-spikes and run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen knife and cut the big chains   Knife Aye aye  cried Quee-queg and seiz-ing the car-pen-ter s heavy hatch-et he leaned out of a port-hole and steel to iron be-gan slash-ing at the largest fluke chains But a few strokes full of sparks were given when the ex-ceed-ing strain ef-fect-ed the rest With a ter-ri-fic snap ev-ery fas-ten-ing went adrift the ship right-ed the car-case sank Now this oc-ca-sion-al in-evitable sink-ing of the re-cent-ly killed Sperm Whale is a very cu-ri-ous thing nor has any fish-er-man yet ad-e-quate-ly ac-count-ed for it Usu-al-ly the dead Sperm Whale floats with great buoy-an-cy with its side or bel-ly con-sid-er-ably el-e-vat-ed above the sur-face If the on-ly whales that thus sank were old mea-gre and bro-ken heart-ed crea-tures their pads of lard di-min-ished and all their bones heavy and rheumat-ic then you might with some rea-son as-sert that this sink-ing is caused by an un-com-mon speci-fic grav-i-ty in the fish so sink-ing con-se-quent up-on this ab-sence of buoy-ant mat-ter in him But it is not so For young whales in the high-est health and swelling with no-ble as-pi-ra-tions pre-ma-ture-ly cut off in the warm flush and May of life with all their pant-ing lard about them even the-se brawny buoy-ant heroes do some-times sink Be it said how-ev-er that the Sperm Whale is far less li-able to this ac-ci-dent than any oth-er species Where one of that sort go down twen-ty Right Whales do This dif-fer-ence in the species is no doubt im-putable in no small de-gree to the greater quan-ti-ty of bone in the Right Whale his Vene-tian blinds alone some-times weigh-ing more than a ton from this in-cum-brance the Sperm Whale is whol-ly free But there are in-stances where af-ter the lapse of many hours or sev-er-al days the sunken whale again ris-es more buoy-ant than in life But the rea-son of this is ob-vi-ous Gas-es are gen-er-at-ed in him he swells to a prodi-gious mag-ni-tude be-comes a sort of an-i-mal bal-loon A line of bat-tle ship could hard-ly keep him un-der then In the Shore Whal-ing on sound-ings among the Bays of New Zealand when a Right Whale gives to-ken of sink-ing they fas-ten buoys to him with plen-ty of rope so that when the body has gone down they know where to look for it when it shall have as-cend-ed again It was not long af-ter the sink-ing of the body that a cry was heard from the Pe-quod s mast heads an-nounc-ing that the Jungfrau was again low-er-ing her boats though the on-ly spout in sight was that of a Fin Back be-long-ing to the species of un-cap-turable whales be-cause of its in-cred-i-ble pow-er of swim-ming Nev-er-the-less the Fin Back s spout is so sim-i-lar to the Sperm Whale s that by un-skil-ful fish-er-men it is of-ten mis-tak-en for it And con-se-quent-ly Der-ick and all his host were now in valiant chase of this un-n-ear-able brute The Vir-gin crowd-ing all sail made af-ter her four young keels and thus they all dis-ap-peared far to lee-ward still in bold hope-ful chase Oh many are the Fin Backs and many are the Der-icks my friend CHAPTER 82 The Honor and Glo-ry of Whal-ing There are some en-ter-pris-es in which a care-ful dis-or-der-li-ness is the true method The more I di-ve in-to this mat-ter of whal-ing and push my re-search-es up to the very spring head of it so much the more am I im-pressed with its great hon-or-able-ness and an-tiq-ui-ty and es-pe-cial-ly when I find so many great demi gods and heroes prophets of all sorts who one way or oth-er have shed dis-tinc-tion up-on it I am trans-port-ed with the re-flec-tion that I my-self be-long though but sub-or-di-nate-ly to so em-bla-zoned a fra-ter-ni-ty The gal-lant Perseus a son of Jupiter was the first whale-man and to the eter-nal hon-or of our call-ing be it said that the first whale at-tacked by our broth-er-hood was not killed with any sor-did in-tent Those were the knight-ly days of our pro-fes-sion when we on-ly bore ar-ms to suc-cor the dis-tressed and not to fill men s lamp feed-ers Every one knows the fine sto-ry of Perseus and An-dromeda how the love-ly An-dromeda the daugh-ter of a king was tied to a rock on the sea coast and as Le-viathan was in the very act of car-ry-ing her off Perseus the prince of whale-men in-trepid-ly ad-vanc-ing har-pooned the mon-ster and de-liv-ered and mar-ried the maid It was an ad-mirable artis-tic ex-ploit rarely achieved by the best har-pooneers of the pre-sent day inas-much as this Le-viathan was slain at the very first dart And let no man doubt this Arkite sto-ry for in the an-cient Jop-pa now Jaf-fa on the Syr-i-an coast in one of the Pa-gan tem-ples there stood for many ages the vast skele-ton of a whale which the city s leg-ends and all the in-hab-i-tan-ts as-sert-ed to be the iden-ti-cal bones of the mon-ster that Perseus slew When the Ro-mans took Jop-pa the same skele-ton was car-ried to Italy in tri-umph What seems most sin-gu-lar and sug-ges-tive-ly im-por-tant in this sto-ry is this it was from Jop-pa that Jon-ah set sail Ak-in to the ad-ven-ture of Perseus and An-dromeda in-deed by some sup-posed to be in-di-rect-ly de-rived from it is that fa-mous sto-ry of St Ge-orge and the Dragon which drag-on I main-tain to have been a whale for in many old chron-i-cles whales and drag-ons are strange-ly jum-bled to-geth-er and of-ten stand for each oth-er  Thou art as a li-on of the wa-ters and as a drag-on of the sea  saith Ezekiel here-by plain-ly mean-ing a whale in truth some ver-sions of the Bi-ble use that word it-self Be-sides it would much sub-tract from the glo-ry of the ex-ploit had St Ge-orge but en-coun-tered a crawl-ing rep-tile of the land in-stead of do-ing bat-tle with the great mon-ster of the deep Any man may kill a snake but on-ly a Perseus a St Ge-orge a Coffin have the heart in them to march bold-ly up to a whale Let not the mod-ern paint-ings of this scene mis-lead us for though the crea-ture en-coun-tered by that valiant whale-man of old is vague-ly rep-re-sent-ed of a griffin like shape and though the bat-tle is de-pict-ed on land and the saint on horse-back yet con-sid-er-ing the great ig-no-rance of those times when the true form of the whale was un-known to artists and con-sid-er-ing that as in Perseus case St Ge-orge s whale might have crawled up out of the sea on the beach and con-sid-er-ing that the an-i-mal rid-den by St Ge-orge might have been on-ly a large seal or sea horse bear-ing all this in mind it will not ap-pear al-to-geth-er in-com-pat-i-ble with the sa-cred leg-end and the an-cien-test draugh-ts of the scene to hold this so called drag-on no oth-er than the great Le-viathan him-self In fact placed be-fore the strict and pierc-ing truth this whole sto-ry will fare like that fish flesh and fowl idol of the Philisti-nes Dagon by name who be-ing plant-ed be-fore the ark of Is-rael his horse s head and both the palms of his hands fell off from him and on-ly the stump or fishy part of him re-mained Thus then one of our own no-ble stamp even a whale-man is the tute-lary guardian of Eng-land and by good rights we har-pooneers of Nan-tuck-et should be en-rolled in the most no-ble or-der of St Ge-orge And there-fore let not the knights of that hon-or-able com-pa-ny none of whom I ven-ture to say have ev-er had to do with a whale like their great pa-tron let them nev-er eye a Nan-tuck-eter with dis-dain since even in our wool-len frocks and tarred trowsers we are much bet-ter en-ti-tled to St Ge-orge s dec-o-ra-tion than they Whether to ad-mit Her-cules among us or not con-cern-ing this I long re-mained du-bi-ous for though ac-cord-ing to the Greek mytholo-gies that an-tique Crock-ett and Kit Car-son that brawny do-er of re-joic-ing good deeds was swal-lowed down and thrown up by a whale still whether that strict-ly makes a whale-man of him that might be moot-ed It nowhere ap-pears that he ev-er ac-tu-al-ly har-pooned his fish un-less in-deed from the in-side Nev-er-the-less he may be deemed a sort of in-vol-un-tary whale-man at any rate the whale caught him if he did not the whale I claim him for one of our clan But by the best con-tra-dic-to-ry au-thor-i-ties this Gre-cian sto-ry of Her-cules and the whale is con-sid-ered to be de-rived from the still more an-cient He-brew sto-ry of Jon-ah and the whale and vice ver-s cer-tain-ly they are very sim-i-lar If I claim the demi god then why not the prophet Nor do heroes sain-ts demigods and prophets alone com-prise the whole roll of our or-der Our grand mas-ter is still to be named for like roy-al kings of old times we find the head wa-ters of our fra-ter-ni-ty in noth-ing short of the great gods them-selves That won-drous ori-en-tal sto-ry is now to be re-hearsed from the Shaster which gives us the dread Vish-noo one of the three per-sons in the god-head of the Hin-doos gives us this di-vine Vish-noo him-self for our Lord  Vish-noo who by the first of his ten earth-ly in-car-na-tions has for ev-er set apart and sanc-ti-fied the whale When Brah-ma or the God of Gods saith the Shaster re-solved to recre-ate the world af-ter one of its pe-ri-od-i-cal dis-so-lu-tions he gave birth to Vish-noo to preside over the work but the Vedas or mys-ti-cal books whose pe-rusal would seem to have been in-dis-pens-able to Vish-noo be-fore be-gin-ning the cre-ation and which there-fore must have con-tained some-thing in the shape of prac-ti-cal hin-ts to young ar-chi-tec-ts the-se Vedas were ly-ing at the bot-tom of the wa-ters so Vish-noo be-came in-car-nate in a whale and sound-ing down in him to the ut-ter-most depths res-cued the sa-cred vol-umes Was not this Vish-noo a whale-man then even as a man who rides a horse is called a horse-man Perseus St Ge-orge Her-cules Jon-ah and Vish-noo there s a mem-ber roll for you What club but the whale-man s can head off like that CHAPTER 83 Jon-ah His-tor-i-cal-ly Re-gard-ed Ref-er-ence was made to the his-tor-i-cal sto-ry of Jon-ah and the whale in the pre-ced-ing chap-ter Now some Nan-tuck-eters rather dis-trust this his-tor-i-cal sto-ry of Jon-ah and the whale But then there were some scep-ti-cal Greeks and Ro-mans who stand-ing out from the or-tho-dox pa-gans of their times equal-ly doubt-ed the sto-ry of Her-cules and the whale and Ari-on and the dol-phin and yet their doubt-ing those tra-di-tions did not make those tra-di-tions one whit the less fac-ts for all that One old Sag Har-bor whale-man s chief rea-son for ques-tion-ing the He-brew sto-ry was this  He had one of those quaint old fash-ioned Bi-bles em-bel-lished with cu-ri-ous un-sci-en-tific plates one of which rep-re-sent-ed Jon-ah s whale with two spouts in his head a pe-cu-liar-i-ty on-ly true with re-spect to a species of the Le-viathan the Right Whale and the va-ri-eties of that or-der con-cern-ing which the fish-er-men have this say-ing  A pen-ny roll would choke him his swal-low is so very small But to this Bish-op Jeb-b s an-tic-i-pa-tive an-swer is ready It is not nec-es-sary hin-ts the Bish-op that we con-sid-er Jon-ah as tombed in the whale s bel-ly but as tem-porar-i-ly lodged in some part of his mouth And this seems rea-son-able enough in the good Bish-op For tru-ly the Right Whale s mouth would ac-com-mo-date a cou-ple of whist ta-bles and com-fort-ably seat all the play-ers Pos-si-bly too Jon-ah might have en-scon-ced him-self in a hol-low tooth but on sec-ond thoughts the Right Whale is tooth-less Another rea-son which Sag Har-bor he went by that name urged for his want of faith in this mat-ter of the prophet was some-thing ob-scure-ly in ref-er-ence to his in-car-cer-at-ed body and the whale s gas-tric juices But this ob-jec-tion like-wise fal-ls to the ground be-cause a Ger-man ex-egetist sup-pos-es that Jon-ah must have tak-en refuge in the float-ing body of a dead whale even as the French sol-diers in the Rus-sian cam-paign turned their dead hors-es in-to ten-ts and crawled in-to them Be-sides it has been di-vined by oth-er con-ti-nen-tal com-men-ta-tors that when Jon-ah was thrown over-board from the Jop-pa ship he straight-way ef-fect-ed his es-cape to an-oth-er ves-sel near by some ves-sel with a whale for a fig-ure head and I would add pos-si-bly called  The Whale  as some craft are nowa-days chris-tened the  Shark  the  Gull  the  Ea-gle  Nor have there been want-ing learned ex-egetists who have opined that the whale men-tioned in the book of Jon-ah mere-ly meant a life pre-server an in-flat-ed bag of wind which the en-dan-gered prophet swam to and so was saved from a wa-tery doom Poor Sag Har-bor there-fore seems worsted all round But he had still an-oth-er rea-son for his want of faith It was this if I re-mem-ber right Jon-ah was swal-lowed by the whale in the Mediter-ranean Sea and af-ter three days he was vom-it-ed up some-where with-in three days jour-ney of Nin-eveh a city on the Ti-gris very much more than three days jour-ney across from the near-est point of the Mediter-ranean coast How is that But was there no oth-er way for the whale to land the prophet with-in that short dis-tance of Nin-eveh Yes He might have car-ried him round by the way of the Cape of Good Hope But not to speak of the pas-sage through the whole length of the Mediter-ranean and an-oth-er pas-sage up the Per-sian Gulf and Red Sea such a sup-po-si-tion would in-volve the com-plete cir-cum-nav-i-ga-tion of all Africa in three days not to speak of the Ti-gris wa-ters near the site of Nin-eveh be-ing too shal-low for any whale to swim in Be-sides this idea of Jon-ah s weath-er-ing the Cape of Good Hope at so ear-ly a day would wrest the hon-or of the dis-cov-ery of that great head-land from Bartholomew Di-az its re-put-ed dis-cov-erer and so make mod-ern his-to-ry a liar But all the-se fool-ish ar-gu-men-ts of old Sag Har-bor on-ly evinced his fool-ish pride of rea-son a thing still more rep-re-hen-si-ble in him see-ing that he had but lit-tle learn-ing ex-cept what he had picked up from the sun and the sea I say it on-ly shows his fool-ish im-pi-ous pride and abom-inable dev-il-ish re-bel-lion again-st the rev-erend cler-gy For by a Por-tugue-se Catholic priest this very idea of Jon-ah s go-ing to Nin-eveh via the Cape of Good Hope was ad-vanced as a sig-nal mag-ni-fi-ca-tion of the gen-er-al mir-a-cle And so it was Be-sides to this day the high-ly en-light-ened Turks de-vout-ly be-lieve in the his-tor-i-cal sto-ry of Jon-ah And some three cen-turies ago an English trav-eller in old Har-ris s Voy-ages speaks of a Turk-ish Mosque built in hon-or of Jon-ah in which Mosque was a mirac-u-lous lamp that burnt with-out any oil CHAPTER 84 Pitch-pol-ing To make them run eas-i-ly and swift-ly the axles of car-riages are anoint-ed and for much the same pur-pose some whalers per-form an anal-o-gous op-er-a-tion up-on their boat they grease the bot-tom Nor is it to be doubt-ed that as such a pro-ce-dure can do no harm it may pos-si-bly be of no con-temptible ad-van-tage con-sid-er-ing that oil and wa-ter are hos-tile that oil is a slid-ing thing and that the ob-ject in view is to make the boat slide brave-ly Quee-queg be-lieved strong-ly in anoint-ing his boat and one morn-ing not long af-ter the Ger-man ship Jungfrau dis-ap-peared took more than cus-tom-ary pains in that oc-cu-pa-tion crawl-ing un-der its bot-tom where it hung over the side and rub-bing in the unc-tu-ous-ness as though dili-gent-ly seek-ing to in-sure a crop of hair from the craft s bald keel He seemed to be work-ing in obe-di-ence to some par-tic-u-lar pre-sen-ti-ment Nor did it re-main un-war-rant-ed by the event Towards noon whales were raised but so soon as the ship sailed down to them they turned and fled with swift pre-cip-i-tan-cy a dis-or-dered flight as of Cleopa-tra s barges from Ac-tium Nev-er-the-less the boats pur-sued and Stub-b s was fore-most By great ex-er-tion Tashte-go at last suc-ceed-ed in plant-ing one iron but the strick-en whale with-out at all sound-ing still con-tin-ued his hor-i-zon-tal flight with added fleet-ness Such un-in-ter-mit-ted strain-ings up-on the plant-ed iron must soon-er or lat-er in-evitably ex-tract it It be-came im-per-a-tive to lance the fly-ing whale or be con-tent to lose him But to haul the boat up to his flank was im-pos-si-ble he swam so fast and fu-ri-ous What then re-mained Of all the won-drous de-vices and dex-ter-i-ties the sleights of hand and count-less sub-tleties to which the vet-er-an whale-man is so of-ten forced none ex-ceed that fine man uvre with the lance called pitch-pol-ing Small sword or broad sword in all its ex-er-cis-es boasts noth-ing like it It is on-ly in-dis-pens-able with an in-vet-er-ate run-ning whale its grand fact and fea-ture is the won-der-ful dis-tance to which the long lance is ac-cu-rate-ly dart-ed from a vi-o-lent-ly rock-ing jerk-ing boat un-der ex-treme head-way Steel and wood in-clud-ed the en-tire spear is some ten or twelve feet in length the staff is much slighter than that of the har-poon and al-so of a lighter ma-te-ri-al pine It is fur-nished with a small rope called a warp of con-sid-er-able length by which it can be hauled back to the hand af-ter dart-ing But be-fore go-ing fur-ther it is im-por-tant to men-tion here that though the har-poon may be pitch-poled in the same way with the lance yet it is sel-dom done and when done is still less fre-quent-ly suc-cess-ful on ac-count of the greater weight and in-fe-ri-or length of the har-poon as com-pared with the lance which in ef-fect be-come se-ri-ous draw-backs As a gen-er-al thing there-fore you must first get fast to a whale be-fore any pitch-pol-ing comes in-to play Look now at Stubb a man who from his hu-mor-ous de-lib-er-ate cool-ness and equa-nim-i-ty in the direst emer-gen-cies was spe-cial-ly qual-i-fied to ex-cel in pitch-pol-ing Look at him he stands up-right in the tossed bow of the fly-ing boat wrapt in fleecy foam the tow-ing whale is forty feet ahead Han-dling the long lance light-ly glanc-ing twice or thrice along its length to see if it be ex-act-ly straight Stubb whistling-ly gath-ers up the coil of the warp in one hand so as to se-cure its free end in his grasp leav-ing the rest un-ob-struct-ed Then hold-ing the lance full be-fore his waist-band s mid-dle he lev-els it at the whale when cov-er-ing him with it he steadi-ly de-press-es the butt end in his hand there-by el-e-vat-ing the point till the weapon stands fair-ly bal-anced up-on his palm fif-teen feet in the air He minds you some-what of a jug-gler bal-anc-ing a long staff on his chin Next mo-ment with a rapid name-less im-pulse in a su-perb lofty arch the bright steel spans the foam-ing dis-tance and quiv-ers in the life spot of the whale In-stead of sparkling wa-ter he now spouts red blood  That drove the spig-ot out of him  cried Stubb   Tis Ju-ly s im-mor-tal Fourth all foun-tains must run wine to-day Would now it were old Or-leans whiskey or old Ohio or un-speak-able old Monon-ga-he-la Then Tashte-go lad I d have ye hold a canakin to the jet and we d drink round it Yea ver-i-ly hearts alive we d brew choice punch in the spread of his spout hole there and from that live punch bowl quaff the liv-ing stuff  Again and again to such game-some talk the dex-ter-ous dart is re-peat-ed the spear re-turn-ing to its mas-ter like a grey-hound held in skil-ful leash The ag-o-nized whale goes in-to his flur-ry the tow line is slack-ened and the pitch-pol-er drop-ping astern folds his hands and mute-ly watch-es the mon-ster die CHAPTER 85 The Foun-tain That for six thou-sand years and no one knows how many mil-lions of ages be-fore the great whales should have been spout-ing all over the sea and sprin-kling and mist-i-fy-ing the gar-dens of the deep as with so many sprin-kling or mist-i-fy-ing pots and that for some cen-turies back thou-sands of hunters should have been close by the foun-tain of the whale watch-ing the-se sprin-klings and spout-ings that all this should be and yet that down to this blessed min-ute fif-teen and a quar-ter min-utes past one o clock P M of this six-teen-th day of De-cem-ber A D 1851 it should still re-main a prob-lem whether the-se spout-ings are af-ter all re-al-ly wa-ter or noth-ing but va-por this is sure-ly a note-wor-thy thing Let us then look at this mat-ter along with some in-ter-est-ing items con-tin-gent Every one knows that by the pe-cu-liar cun-ning of their gills the finny tribes in gen-er-al breathe the air which at all times is com-bined with the el-e-ment in which they swim hence a her-ring or a cod might live a cen-tu-ry and nev-er on-ce raise its head above the sur-face But ow-ing to his marked in-ter-nal struc-ture which gives him reg-u-lar lungs like a hu-man be-ing s the whale can on-ly live by in-hal-ing the dis-en-gaged air in the open at-mo-sphere Where-fore the ne-ces-si-ty for his pe-ri-od-i-cal vis-its to the up-per world But he can-not in any de-gree breathe through his mouth for in his or-di-nary at-ti-tude the Sperm Whale s mouth is buried at least eight feet be-neath the sur-face and what is still more his wind-pipe has no con-nex-ion with his mouth No he breathes through his spir-a-cle alone and this is on the top of his head If I say that in any crea-ture breath-ing is on-ly a func-tion in-dis-pens-able to vi-tal-i-ty inas-much as it with-draws from the air a cer-tain el-e-ment which be-ing sub-se-quent-ly brought in-to con-tact with the blood im-parts to the blood its viv-i-fy-ing prin-ci-ple I do not think I shall err though I may pos-si-bly use some su-per-flu-ous sci-en-tific words As-sume it and it fol-lows that if all the blood in a man could be aer-at-ed with one breath he might then seal up his nos-trils and not fetch an-oth-er for a con-sid-er-able time That is to say he would then live with-out breath-ing Ano-ma-lous as it may seem this is pre-cise-ly the case with the whale who sys-tem-at-i-cal-ly lives by in-ter-vals his full hour and more when at the bot-tom with-out draw-ing a sin-gle breath or so much as in any way in-hal-ing a par-ti-cle of air for re-mem-ber he has no gills How is this Between his ribs and on each side of his spine he is sup-plied with a re-mark-able in-volved Cre-tan labyrinth of ver-mi-cel-li like ves-sels which ves-sels when he quits the sur-face are com-plete-ly dis-tend-ed with oxy-genat-ed blood So that for an hour or more a thou-sand fath-oms in the sea he car-ries a sur-plus stock of vi-tal-i-ty in him just as the camel cross-ing the wa-ter-less de-sert car-ries a sur-plus sup-ply of drink for fu-ture use in its four sup-ple-men-tary stom-achs The anatom-i-cal fact of this labyrinth is in-dis-putable and that the sup-po-si-tion found-ed up-on it is rea-son-able and true seems the more co-gent to me when I con-sid-er the oth-er-wise in-ex-pli-ca-ble ob-sti-na-cy of that leviathan in hav-ing his spout-ings out as the fish-er-men phrase it This is what I mean If un-mo-lest-ed up-on ris-ing to the sur-face the Sperm Whale will con-tin-ue there for a pe-ri-od of time ex-act-ly uni-form with all his oth-er un-mo-lest-ed ris-ings Say he stays eleven min-utes and jets sev-en-ty times that is respires sev-en-ty breaths then when-ev-er he ris-es again he will be sure to have his sev-en-ty breaths over again to a min-ute Now if af-ter he fetch-es a few breaths you alarm him so that he sounds he will be al-ways dodg-ing up again to make good his reg-u-lar al-lowance of air And not till those sev-en-ty breaths are told will he fi-nal-ly go down to stay out his full term be-low Re-mark how-ev-er that in dif-fer-ent in-di-vid-u-als the-se rates are dif-fer-ent but in any one they are alike Now why should the whale thus in-sist up-on hav-ing his spout-ings out un-less it be to re-plen-ish his reser-voir of air ere de-scend-ing for good How ob-vi-ous is it too that this ne-ces-si-ty for the whale s ris-ing ex-pos-es him to all the fa-tal haz-ards of the chase For not by hook or by net could this vast leviathan be caught when sail-ing a thou-sand fath-oms be-neath the sun-light Not so much thy skill then O hunter as the great ne-ces-si-ties that strike the vic-to-ry to thee In man breath-ing is in-ces-sant-ly go-ing on one breath on-ly serv-ing for two or three pul-sa-tions so that what-ev-er oth-er busi-ness he has to at-tend to wak-ing or sleep-ing breathe he must or die he will But the Sperm Whale on-ly breathes about one sev-en-th or Sun-day of his time It has been said that the whale on-ly breathes through his spout hole if it could truth-ful-ly be added that his spouts are mixed with wa-ter then I opine we should be fur-nished with the rea-son why his sense of smell seems oblit-er-at-ed in him for the on-ly thing about him that at all an-swers to his nose is that iden-ti-cal spout hole and be-ing so clogged with two el-e-men-ts it could not be ex-pect-ed to have the pow-er of smelling But ow-ing to the mys-tery of the spout whether it be wa-ter or whether it be va-por no ab-so-lute cer-tain-ty can as yet be ar-rived at on this head Sure it is nev-er-the-less that the Sperm Whale has no prop-er ol-fac-to-ries But what does he want of them No ros-es no vi-o-lets no Cologne wa-ter in the sea Fur-ther-more as his wind-pipe sole-ly opens in-to the tube of his spout-ing canal and as that long canal like the grand Erie Canal is fur-nished with a sort of locks that open and shut for the down-ward re-ten-tion of air or the up-ward ex-clu-sion of wa-ter there-fore the whale has no voice un-less you in-sult him by say-ing that when he so strange-ly rum-bles he talks through his nose But then again what has the whale to say Sel-dom have I known any pro-found be-ing that had any-thing to say to this world un-less forced to stam-mer out some-thing by way of get-ting a liv-ing Oh hap-py that the world is such an ex-cel-lent lis-ten-er Now the spout-ing canal of the Sperm Whale chiefly in-tend-ed as it is for the con-veyance of air and for sev-er-al feet laid along hor-i-zon-tal-ly just be-neath the up-per sur-face of his head and a lit-tle to one side this cu-ri-ous canal is very much like a gas pipe laid down in a city on one side of a street But the ques-tion re-turns whether this gas pipe is al-so a wa-ter pipe in oth-er words whether the spout of the Sperm Whale is the mere va-por of the ex-haled breath or whether that ex-haled breath is mixed with wa-ter tak-en in at the mouth and dis-charged through the spir-a-cle It is cer-tain that the mouth in-di-rect-ly com-mu-ni-cates with the spout-ing canal but it can-not be proved that this is for the pur-pose of dis-charg-ing wa-ter through the spir-a-cle Be-cause the great-est ne-ces-si-ty for so do-ing would seem to be when in feed-ing he ac-ci-den-tal-ly takes in wa-ter But the Sperm Whale s food is far be-neath the sur-face and there he can-not spout even if he would Be-sides if you re-gard him very close-ly and time him with your watch you will find that when un-mo-lest-ed there is an un-de-vi-at-ing rhyme be-tween the pe-ri-ods of his jets and the or-di-nary pe-ri-ods of res-pi-ra-tion But why pester one with all this rea-son-ing on the sub-ject Speak out You have seen him spout then de-clare what the spout is can you not tell wa-ter from air My dear sir in this world it is not so easy to set-tle the-se plain things I have ev-er found your plain things the knot-ti-est of all And as for this whale spout you might al-most stand in it and yet be un-de-cid-ed as to what it is pre-cise-ly The cen-tral body of it is hid-den in the snowy sparkling mist en-velop-ing it and how can you cer-tain-ly tell whether any wa-ter fal-ls from it when al-ways when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view of his spout he is in a prodi-gious com-mo-tion the wa-ter cas-cad-ing all around him And if at such times you should think that you re-al-ly per-ceived drops of mois-ture in the spout how do you know that they are not mere-ly con-densed from its va-por or how do you know that they are not those iden-ti-cal drops su-per-fi-cial-ly lodged in the spout hole fis-sure which is coun-ter-sunk in-to the sum-mit of the whale s head For even when tran-quil-ly swim-ming through the mid day sea in a calm with his el-e-vat-ed hump sun dried as a dromedary s in the de-sert even then the whale al-ways car-ries a small bas-in of wa-ter on his head as un-der a blaz-ing sun you will some-times see a cav-i-ty in a rock filled up with rain Nor is it at all pru-dent for the hunter to be over cu-ri-ous touch-ing the pre-cise na-ture of the whale spout It will not do for him to be peer-ing in-to it and putting his face in it You can-not go with your pitcher to this foun-tain and fill it and bring it away For even when com-ing in-to slight con-tact with the out-er va-pory shreds of the jet which will of-ten hap-pen your skin will fever-ish-ly smart from the acrid-ness of the thing so touch-ing it And I know one who com-ing in-to still closer con-tact with the spout whether with some sci-en-tific ob-ject in view or oth-er-wise I can-not say the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm Where-fore among whale-men the spout is deemed poi-sonous they try to evade it Another thing I have heard it said and I do not much doubt it that if the jet is fair-ly spout-ed in-to your eyes it will blind you The wis-est thing the in-ves-ti-ga-tor can do then it seems to me is to let this dead-ly spout alone Still we can hy-poth-e-size even if we can-not prove and es-tab-lish My hy-poth-e-sis is this that the spout is noth-ing but mist And be-sides oth-er rea-sons to this con-clu-sion I am im-pelled by con-sid-er-a-tions touch-ing the great in-her-ent dig-ni-ty and sub-lim-i-ty of the Sperm Whale I ac-count him no com-mon shal-low be-ing inas-much as it is an undis-put-ed fact that he is nev-er found on sound-ings or near shores all oth-er whales some-times are He is both pon-der-ous and pro-found And I am con-vinced that from the heads of all pon-der-ous pro-found be-ings such as Pla-to Pyrrho the Devil Jupiter Dan-te and so on there al-ways goes up a cer-tain semi vis-i-ble steam while in the act of think-ing deep thoughts While com-pos-ing a lit-tle trea-tise on Eter-ni-ty I had the cu-rios-i-ty to place a mir-ror be-fore me and ere long saw re-flect-ed there a cu-ri-ous in-volved worm-ing and un-du-la-tion in the at-mo-sphere over my head The in-vari-able mois-ture of my hair while plunged in deep thought af-ter six cups of hot tea in my thin shin-gled at-tic of an Au-gust noon this seems an ad-di-tion-al ar-gu-ment for the above sup-po-si-tion And how nobly it rais-es our con-ceit of the mighty misty mon-ster to be-hold him solemn-ly sail-ing through a calm trop-i-cal sea his vast mild head over-hung by a canopy of va-por en-gen-dered by his in-com-mu-ni-ca-ble con-tem-pla-tions and that va-por as you will some-times see it glo-ri-fied by a rain-bow as if Heav-en it-self had put its seal up-on his thoughts For d ye see rain-bows do not vis-it the clear air they on-ly ir-ra-di-ate va-por And so through all the thick mis-ts of the dim doubts in my mind di-vine in-tu-itions now and then shoot enkin-dling my fog with a heav-en-ly ray And for this I thank God for all have doubts many deny but doubts or de-nials few along with them have in-tu-itions Doubts of all things earth-ly and in-tu-itions of some things heav-en-ly this com-bi-na-tion makes nei-ther be-liev-er nor in-fi-del but makes a man who re-gards them both with equal eye CHAPTER 86 The Tail Other po-ets have war-bled the prais-es of the soft eye of the an-telope and the love-ly plumage of the bird that nev-er alights less ce-les-tial I cel-e-brate a tail Reck-on-ing the largest sized Sperm Whale s tail to be-gin at that point of the trunk where it ta-pers to about the girth of a man it com-pris-es up-on its up-per sur-face alone an area of at least fifty square feet The com-pact round body of its root ex-pands in-to two broad firm flat palms or flukes grad-u-al-ly shoal-ing away to less than an inch in thick-ness At the crotch or junc-tion the-se flukes slight-ly over-lap then side-ways re-cede from each oth-er like wings leav-ing a wide va-can-cy be-tween In no liv-ing thing are the lines of beau-ty more exquisite-ly de-fined than in the cres-cen-tic bor-ders of the-se flukes At its ut-most ex-pan-sion in the full grown whale the tail will con-sid-er-ably ex-ceed twen-ty feet across The en-tire mem-ber seems a dense webbed bed of weld-ed sinews but cut in-to it and you find that three dis-tinct strata com-pose it  up-per mid-dle and low-er The fi-bres in the up-per and low-er lay-ers are long and hor-i-zon-tal those of the mid-dle one very short and run-ning cross-wise be-tween the out-side lay-ers This tri-une struc-ture as much as any-thing else im-parts pow-er to the tail To the stu-dent of old Ro-man wal-ls the mid-dle lay-er will fur-nish a cu-ri-ous par-al-lel to the thin course of tiles al-ways al-ter-nat-ing with the stone in those won-der-ful relics of the an-tique and which un-doubt-ed-ly con-tribute so much to the great strength of the ma-son-ry But as if this vast lo-cal pow-er in the tendi-nous tail were not enough the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of mus-cu-lar fi-bres and fil-a-men-ts which pass-ing on ei-ther side the loins and run-ning down in-to the flukes in-sen-si-bly blend with them and large-ly con-tribute to their might so that in the tail the con-flu-ent mea-sure-less force of the whole whale seems con-cen-trat-ed to a point Could an-ni-hi-la-tion oc-cur to mat-ter this were the thing to do it Nor does this its amaz-ing strength at all tend to crip-ple the grace-ful flex-ion of its mo-tions where in-fan-tile-ness of ease un-du-lates through a Ti-tanism of pow-er On the con-trary those mo-tions de-rive their most ap-palling beau-ty from it Real strength nev-er im-pairs beau-ty or har-mony but it of-ten be-stows it and in ev-ery-thing im-pos-ing-ly beau-ti-ful strength has much to do with the mag-ic Take away the tied ten-dons that all over seem burst-ing from the mar-ble in the carved Her-cules and its charm would be gone As de-vout Eck-er-man lift-ed the linen sheet from the naked corpse of Goethe he was over-whelmed with the mas-sive chest of the man that seemed as a Ro-man tri-umphal arch When An-gelo paints even God the Father in hu-man form mark what ro-bust-ness is there And what-ev-er they may re-veal of the di-vine love in the Son the soft curled hermaphrodit-i-cal Ital-ian pic-tures in which his idea has been most suc-cess-ful-ly em-bod-ied the-se pic-tures so des-ti-tute as they are of all brawni-ness hint noth-ing of any pow-er but the mere neg-a-tive fem-i-nine one of sub-mis-sion and en-durance which on all hands it is con-ced-ed form the pe-cu-liar prac-ti-cal virtues of his teach-ings Such is the sub-tle elas-tic-i-ty of the or-gan I treat of that whether wield-ed in sport or in earnest or in anger what-ev-er be the mood it be in its flex-ions are in-vari-ably marked by ex-ceed-ing grace There-in no fairy s arm can tran-scend it Five great mo-tions are pe-cu-liar to it First when used as a fin for pro-gres-sion Se-cond when used as a mace in bat-tle Third in sweep-ing Fourth in lob-tail-ing Fifth in peak-ing flukes First Be-ing hor-i-zon-tal in its po-si-tion the Le-viathan s tail ac-ts in a dif-fer-ent man-ner from the tails of all oth-er sea crea-tures It nev-er wrig-gles In man or fish wrig-gling is a sign of in-fe-ri-or-i-ty To the whale his tail is the sole means of propul-sion Scroll wise coiled for-wards be-neath the body and then rapid-ly sprung back-wards it is this which gives that sin-gu-lar dart-ing leap-ing mo-tion to the mon-ster when fu-ri-ous-ly swim-ming His side fins on-ly serve to steer by Se-cond It is a lit-tle sig-nif-i-cant that while one sperm whale on-ly fights an-oth-er sperm whale with his head and jaw nev-er-the-less in his con-flic-ts with man he chiefly and con-temp-tu-ous-ly us-es his tail In strik-ing at a boat he swift-ly curves away his flukes from it and the blow is on-ly in-flict-ed by the re-coil If it be made in the un-ob-struct-ed air es-pe-cial-ly if it de-scend to its mark the stroke is then sim-ply ir-re-sistible No ribs of man or boat can with-stand it Your on-ly sal-va-tion lies in elud-ing it but if it comes side-ways through the op-pos-ing wa-ter then part-ly ow-ing to the light buoy-an-cy of the whale boat and the elas-tic-i-ty of its ma-te-ri-als a cracked rib or a dashed plank or two a sort of stitch in the side is gen-er-al-ly the most se-ri-ous re-sult Th-e-se sub-merged side blows are so of-ten re-ceived in the fish-ery that they are ac-count-ed mere child s play Some one strips off a frock and the hole is stopped Third I can-not demon-strate it but it seems to me that in the whale the sense of touch is con-cen-trat-ed in the tail for in this re-spect there is a del-i-ca-cy in it on-ly equalled by the dain-ti-ness of the ele-phan-t s trunk This del-i-ca-cy is chiefly evinced in the ac-tion of sweep-ing when in maid-en-ly gen-tle-ness the whale with a cer-tain soft slow-ness moves his im-mense flukes from side to side up-on the sur-face of the sea and if he feel but a sailor s whisker woe to that sailor whiskers and all What ten-der-ness there is in that pre-lim-i-nary touch Had this tail any pre-hen-sile pow-er I should straight-way be-think me of Dar-mon-odes ele-phant that so fre-quent-ed the flow-er mar-ket and with low salu-ta-tions pre-sent-ed nosegays to damsels and then ca-ressed their zones On more ac-coun-ts than one a pity it is that the whale does not pos-sess this pre-hen-sile virtue in his tail for I have heard of yet an-oth-er ele-phant that when wound-ed in the fight curved round his trunk and ex-tract-ed the dart Fourth Steal-ing un-awares up-on the whale in the fan-cied se-cu-ri-ty of the mid-dle of soli-tary seas you find him un-bent from the vast cor-pu-lence of his dig-ni-ty and kit-ten like he plays on the ocean as if it were a hearth But still you see his pow-er in his play The broad palms of his tail are flirt-ed high in-to the air then smit-ing the sur-face the thun-der-ous con-cus-sion re-sounds for miles You would al-most think a great gun had been dis-charged and if you no-ticed the light wreath of va-por from the spir-a-cle at his oth-er ex-trem-i-ty you would think that that was the smoke from the touch hole Fifth As in the or-di-nary float-ing pos-ture of the leviathan the flukes lie con-sid-er-ably be-low the lev-el of his back they are then com-plete-ly out of sight be-neath the sur-face but when he is about to plunge in-to the deeps his en-tire flukes with at least thir-ty feet of his body are tossed erect in the air and so re-main vi-brat-ing a mo-ment till they down-wards shoot out of view Ex-cept-ing the sub-lime breach  some-where else to be de-scribed this peak-ing of the whale s flukes is per-haps the grandest sight to be seen in all an-i-mat-ed na-ture Out of the bot-tom-less pro-fun-di-ties the gi-gan-tic tail seems spas-mod-i-cal-ly snatch-ing at the high-est heav-en So in dreams have I seen ma-jes-tic Satan thrust-ing forth his tor-ment-ed colos-sal claw from the flame Baltic of Hell But in gaz-ing at such sce-nes it is all in all what mood you are in if in the Dan-tean the dev-ils will oc-cur to you if in that of Isa-iah the archangels Stand-ing at the mast head of my ship dur-ing a sun-rise that crim-soned sky and sea I on-ce saw a large herd of whales in the east all head-ing to-wards the sun and for a mo-ment vi-brat-ing in con-cert with peaked flukes As it seemed to me at the time such a grand em-bod-i-ment of ado-ra-tion of the gods was nev-er be-held even in Per-sia the home of the fire wor-ship-pers As Ptole-my Philopa-ter tes-ti-fied of the African ele-phant I then tes-ti-fied of the whale pro-nounc-ing him the most de-vout of all be-ings For ac-cord-ing to King Juba the mil-i-tary ele-phan-ts of an-tiq-ui-ty of-ten hailed the morn-ing with their trunks up-lift-ed in the pro-foundest si-lence The chance com-par-ison in this chap-ter be-tween the whale and the ele-phant so far as some as-pec-ts of the tail of the one and the trunk of the oth-er are con-cerned should not tend to place those two op-po-site or-gans on an equal-i-ty much less the crea-tures to which they re-spec-tive-ly be-long For as the might-i-est ele-phant is but a ter-ri-er to Le-viathan so com-pared with Le-viathan s tail his trunk is but the stalk of a lily The most dire-ful blow from the ele-phan-t s trunk were as the play-ful tap of a fan com-pared with the mea-sure-less crush and crash of the sperm whale s pon-der-ous flukes which in re-peat-ed in-stances have one af-ter the oth-er hurled en-tire boats with all their oars and crews in-to the air very much as an In-di-an jug-gler toss-es his bal-ls Though all com-par-ison in the way of gen-er-al bulk be-tween the whale and the ele-phant is pre-pos-ter-ous inas-much as in that par-tic-u-lar the ele-phant stands in much the same re-spect to the whale that a dog does to the ele-phant nev-er-the-less there are not want-ing some points of cu-ri-ous simil-i-tude among the-se is the spout It is well known that the ele-phant will of-ten draw up wa-ter or dust in his trunk and then el-e-vat-ing it jet it forth in a stream The more I con-sid-er this mighty tail the more do I de-plore my in-abil-i-ty to ex-press it At times there are ges-tures in it which though they would well grace the hand of man re-main whol-ly in-ex-pli-ca-ble In an ex-ten-sive herd so re-mark-able oc-ca-sion-al-ly are the-se mys-tic ges-tures that I have heard hunters who have de-clared them ak-in to Free Ma-son signs and sym-bols that the whale in-deed by the-se meth-ods in-tel-li-gent-ly con-versed with the world Nor are there want-ing oth-er mo-tions of the whale in his gen-er-al body full of strangeness and un-ac-count-able to his most ex-pe-ri-enced as-sailant Dis-sect him how I may then I but go skin deep I know him not and nev-er will But if I know not even the tail of this whale how un-der-stand his head much more how com-pre-hend his face when face he has none Thou shalt see my back parts my tail he seems to say but my face shall not be seen But I can-not com-plete-ly make out his back parts and hint what he will about his face I say again he has no face CHAPTER 87 The Grand Ar-mada The long and nar-row penin-su-la of Malac-ca ex-tend-ing south east-ward from the ter-ri-to-ries of Birmah for-ms the most souther-ly point of all Asia In a con-tin-u-ous line from that penin-su-la stretch the long is-lands of Su-ma-tra Java Bal-ly and Ti-mor which with many oth-ers form a vast mole or ram-part length-wise con-nect-ing Asia with Aus-tralia and di-vid-ing the long un-bro-ken In-di-an ocean from the thick-ly stud-ded ori-en-tal archipela-goes This ram-part is pierced by sev-er-al sal-ly ports for the con-ve-nience of ships and whales con-spic-u-ous among which are the straits of Sun-da and Malac-ca By the straits of Sun-da chiefly ves-sels bound to Chi-na from the west emerge in-to the Chi-na seas Those nar-row straits of Sun-da di-vide Su-ma-tra from Java and stand-ing mid-way in that vast ram-part of is-lands but-tressed by that bold green promon-to-ry known to sea-men as Java Head they not a lit-tle cor-re-spond to the cen-tral gate-way open-ing in-to some vast walled em-pire and con-sid-er-ing the in-ex-haustible wealth of spices and silks and jew-els and gold and ivory with which the thou-sand is-lands of that ori-en-tal sea are en-riched it seems a sig-nif-i-cant pro-vi-sion of na-ture that such trea-sures by the very for-ma-tion of the land should at least bear the ap-pear-ance how-ev-er in-ef-fec-tu-al of be-ing guard-ed from the all grasp-ing west-ern world The shores of the Straits of Sun-da are un-sup-plied with those dom-i-neer-ing fortress-es which guard the en-trances to the Mediter-ranean the Baltic and the Pro-pon-tis Un-like the Danes the-se Ori-en-tals do not de-mand the ob-se-quious homage of low-ered top sails from the end-less pro-ces-sion of ships be-fore the wind which for cen-turies past by night and by day have passed be-tween the is-lands of Su-ma-tra and Java freight-ed with the costli-est car-goes of the east But while they freely waive a cer-e-mo-ni-al like this they do by no means re-nounce their claim to more solid trib-ute Time out of mind the pi-rat-i-cal proas of the Malays lurk-ing among the low shad-ed coves and islets of Su-ma-tra have sal-lied out up-on the ves-sels sail-ing through the straits fierce-ly de-mand-ing trib-ute at the point of their spears Though by the re-peat-ed bloody chas-tise-men-ts they have re-ceived at the hands of Euro-pean cruis-ers the au-dac-i-ty of the-se cor-sairs has of late been some-what re-pressed yet even at the pre-sent day we oc-ca-sion-al-ly hear of English and Amer-i-can ves-sels which in those wa-ters have been re-morse-less-ly board-ed and pil-laged With a fair fresh wind the Pe-quod was now draw-ing nigh to the-se straits Ahab pur-pos-ing to pass through them in-to the Ja-van sea and thence cruis-ing north-wards over wa-ters known to be fre-quent-ed here and there by the Sperm Whale sweep in-shore by the Philip-pine Is-lands and gain the far coast of Ja-pan in time for the great whal-ing sea-son there By the-se means the cir-cum-nav-i-gat-ing Pe-quod would sweep al-most all the known Sperm Whale cruis-ing grounds of the world pre-vi-ous to de-scend-ing up-on the Line in the Paci-fic where Ahab though ev-ery-where else foiled in his pur-suit firm-ly count-ed up-on giv-ing bat-tle to Moby Dick in the sea he was most known to fre-quent and at a sea-son when he might most rea-son-ably be pre-sumed to be haunt-ing it But how now in this zoned quest does Ahab touch no land does his crew drink air Sure-ly he will stop for wa-ter Nay For a long time now the cir-cus run-ning sun has raced with-in his fiery ring and needs no sus-te-nance but what s in him-self So Ahab Mark this too in the whaler While oth-er hul-ls are load-ed down with alien stuff to be trans-ferred to for-eign wharves the world wan-der-ing whale ship car-ries no car-go but her-self and crew their weapons and their wan-ts She has a whole lake s con-tents bot-tled in her am-ple hold She is bal-last-ed with util-i-ties not al-to-geth-er with un-us-able pig lead and ken-tledge She car-ries years wa-ter in her Clear old prime Nan-tuck-et wa-ter which when three years afloat the Nan-tuck-eter in the Paci-fic prefers to drink be-fore the brack-ish flu-id but yes-ter-day raft-ed off in casks from the Peru-vian or In-di-an streams Hence it is that while oth-er ships may have gone to Chi-na from New York and back again touch-ing at a score of ports the whale ship in all that in-ter-val may not have sight-ed one grain of soil her crew hav-ing seen no man but float-ing sea-men like them-selves So that did you car-ry them the news that an-oth-er flood had come they would on-ly an-swer  Well boys here s the ark  Now as many Sperm Whales had been cap-tured off the west-ern coast of Java in the near vicin-i-ty of the Straits of Sun-da in-deed as most of the ground round-about was gen-er-al-ly recog-nised by the fish-er-men as an ex-cel-lent spot for cruis-ing there-fore as the Pe-quod gained more and more up-on Java Head the look outs were re-peat-ed-ly hailed and ad-mon-ished to keep wide awake But though the green palmy cliffs of the land soon loomed on the star-board bow and with de-light-ed nos-trils the fresh cin-na-mon was snuffed in the air yet not a sin-gle jet was de-scried Al-most re-nounc-ing all thought of falling in with any game here-abouts the ship had well nigh en-tered the straits when the cus-tom-ary cheer-ing cry was heard from aloft and ere long a spec-ta-cle of sin-gu-lar mag-nif-i-cence salut-ed us But here be it premised that ow-ing to the un-wea-ried ac-tiv-i-ty with which of late they have been hunt-ed over all four oceans the Sperm Whales in-stead of al-most in-vari-ably sail-ing in small de-tached com-pa-nies as in for-mer times are now fre-quent-ly met with in ex-ten-sive herds some-times em-brac-ing so great a mul-ti-tude that it would al-most seem as if nu-mer-ous na-tions of them had sworn solemn league and covenant for mu-tu-al as-sis-tance and pro-tec-tion To this ag-gre-ga-tion of the Sperm Whale in-to such im-mense car-a-vans may be im-put-ed the cir-cum-stance that even in the best cruis-ing grounds you may now some-times sail for weeks and months to-geth-er with-out be-ing greet-ed by a sin-gle spout and then be sud-den-ly salut-ed by what some-times seems thou-sands on thou-sands Broad on both bows at the dis-tance of some two or three miles and form-ing a great semi-cir-cle em-brac-ing one half of the lev-el hori-zon a con-tin-u-ous chain of whale jets were up play-ing and sparkling in the noon day air Un-like the straight per-pen-dic-u-lar twin jets of the Right Whale which di-vid-ing at top fall over in two branch-es like the cleft droop-ing boughs of a wil-low the sin-gle for-ward slant-ing spout of the Sperm Whale pre-sen-ts a thick curled bush of white mist con-tin-u-al-ly ris-ing and falling away to lee-ward Seen from the Pe-quod s deck then as she would rise on a high hill of the sea this host of va-pory spouts in-di-vid-u-al-ly curling up in-to the air and be-held through a blend-ing at-mo-sphere of bluish haze showed like the thou-sand cheer-ful chim-neys of some dense metropolis de-scried of a balmy au-tum-nal morn-ing by some horse-man on a height As march-ing armies ap-proach-ing an un-friend-ly de-file in the moun-tains ac-cel-er-ate their march all ea-ger-ness to place that per-ilous pas-sage in their rear and on-ce more ex-pand in com-par-a-tive se-cu-ri-ty up-on the plain even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hur-ry-ing for-ward through the straits grad-u-al-ly con-tract-ing the wings of their semi-cir-cle and swim-ming on in one solid but still cres-cen-tic cen-tre Crowd-ing all sail the Pe-quod pressed af-ter them the har-pooneers han-dling their weapons and loud-ly cheer-ing from the heads of their yet sus-pend-ed boats If the wind on-ly held lit-tle doubt had they that chased through the-se Straits of Sun-da the vast host would on-ly de-ploy in-to the Ori-en-tal seas to wit-ness the cap-ture of not a few of their num-ber And who could tell whether in that con-gre-gat-ed car-a-van Moby Dick him-self might not tem-porar-i-ly be swim-ming like the wor-shipped white ele-phant in the coro-na-tion pro-ces-sion of the Si-ame-se So with stun sail piled on stun sail we sailed along driv-ing the-se leviathans be-fore us when of a sud-den the voice of Tashte-go was heard loud-ly di-rect-ing at-ten-tion to some-thing in our wake Cor-re-spond-ing to the cres-cent in our van we be-held an-oth-er in our rear It seemed formed of de-tached white va-pors ris-ing and falling some-thing like the spouts of the whales on-ly they did not so com-plete-ly come and go for they con-stant-ly hov-ered with-out fi-nal-ly dis-ap-pear-ing Lev-el-ling his glass at this sight Ahab quick-ly re-volved in his piv-ot hole cry-ing  Aloft there and rig whips and buck-ets to wet the sails  Malays sir and af-ter us  As if too long lurk-ing be-hind the head-lands till the Pe-quod should fair-ly have en-tered the straits the-se ras-cal-ly Asi-at-ics were now in hot pur-suit to make up for their over cau-tious de-lay But when the swift Pe-quod with a fresh lead-ing wind was her-self in hot chase how very kind of the-se tawny phi-lan-thropists to as-sist in speed-ing her on to her own cho-sen pur-suit  mere rid-ing whips and row-els to her that they were As with glass un-der arm Ahab to and fro paced the deck in his for-ward turn be-hold-ing the mon-sters he chased and in the af-ter one the blood-thirsty pi-rates chas-ing him some such fan-cy as the above seemed his And when he glanced up-on the green wal-ls of the wa-tery de-file in which the ship was then sail-ing and bethought him that through that gate lay the route to his vengeance and be-held how that through that same gate he was now both chas-ing and be-ing chased to his dead-ly end and not on-ly that but a herd of re-morse-less wild pi-rates and in-hu-man athe-is-ti-cal dev-ils were in-fer-nal-ly cheer-ing him on with their curs-es  when all the-se con-ceits had passed through his brain Ahab s brow was left gaunt and ribbed like the black sand beach af-ter some stormy tide has been gnaw-ing it with-out be-ing able to drag the firm thing from its place But thoughts like the-se trou-bled very few of the reck-less crew and when af-ter steadi-ly drop-ping and drop-ping the pi-rates astern the Pe-quod at last shot by the vivid green Cock-a-too Point on the Su-ma-tra side emerg-ing at last up-on the broad wa-ters be-yond then the har-pooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been gain-ing up-on the ship than to re-joice that the ship had so vic-to-ri-ous-ly gained up-on the Malays But still driv-ing on in the wake of the whales at length they seemed abat-ing their speed grad-u-al-ly the ship neared them and the wind now dy-ing away word was passed to spring to the boats But no soon-er did the herd by some pre-sumed won-der-ful in-stinct of the Sperm Whale be-come no-ti-fied of the three keels that were af-ter them  though as yet a mile in their rear  than they ral-lied again and form-ing in close ranks and bat-tal-ions so that their spouts all looked like flash-ing lines of stacked bay-o-nets moved on with re-dou-bled ve-loc-i-ty Stripped to our shirts and draw-ers we sprang to the white ash and af-ter sev-er-al hours pulling were al-most dis-posed to re-nounce the chase when a gen-er-al paus-ing com-mo-tion among the whales gave an-i-mat-ing to-ken that they were now at last un-der the in-flu-ence of that strange per-plex-i-ty of in-ert ir-res-o-lu-tion which when the fish-er-men per-ceive it in the whale they say he is gal-lied The com-pact mar-tial colum-ns in which they had been hith-er-to rapid-ly and steadi-ly swim-ming were now bro-ken up in one mea-sure-less rout and like King Porus ele-phan-ts in the In-di-an bat-tle with Alexan-der they seemed go-ing mad with con-ster-na-tion In all di-rec-tions ex-pand-ing in vast ir-reg-u-lar cir-cles and aim-less-ly swim-ming hith-er and thith-er by their short thick spout-ings they plain-ly be-trayed their dis-trac-tion of pan-ic This was still more strange-ly evinced by those of their num-ber who com-plete-ly paral-ysed as it were help-less-ly float-ed like wa-ter logged dis-man-tled ships on the sea Had the-se Le-viathans been but a flock of sim-ple sheep pur-sued over the pas-ture by three fierce wolves they could not pos-si-bly have evinced such ex-ces-sive dis-may But this oc-ca-sion-al timid-i-ty is char-ac-ter-is-tic of al-most all herd-ing crea-tures Though band-ing to-geth-er in tens of thou-sands the li-on maned buf-faloes of the West have fled be-fore a soli-tary horse-man Wit-ness too all hu-man be-ings how when herd-ed to-geth-er in the sheep-fold of a the-atre s pit they will at the slight-est alarm of fire rush hel-ter skel-ter for the out-lets crowd-ing tram-pling jam-ming and re-morse-less-ly dash-ing each oth-er to death Best there-fore with-hold any amaze-ment at the strange-ly gal-lied whales be-fore us for there is no fol-ly of the beasts of the earth which is not in-finite-ly out-done by the mad-ness of men Though many of the whales as has been said were in vi-o-lent mo-tion yet it is to be ob-served that as a whole the herd nei-ther ad-vanced nor re-treat-ed but col-lec-tive-ly re-mained in one place As is cus-tom-ary in those cas-es the boats at on-ce sep-a-rat-ed each mak-ing for some one lone whale on the out-skirts of the shoal In about three min-utes time Quee-queg s har-poon was flung the strick-en fish dart-ed blind-ing spray in our faces and then run-ning away with us like light steered straight for the heart of the herd Though such a move-ment on the part of the whale struck un-der such cir-cum-stances is in no wise un-prece-dent-ed and in-deed is al-most al-ways more or less an-tic-i-pat-ed yet does it pre-sent one of the more per-ilous vi-cis-si-tudes of the fish-ery For as the swift mon-ster drags you deep-er and deep-er in-to the fran-tic shoal you bid adieu to cir-cum-spect life and on-ly ex-ist in a deliri-ous throb As blind and deaf the whale plunged for-ward as if by sheer pow-er of speed to rid him-self of the iron leech that had fas-tened to him as we thus tore a white gash in the sea on all sides men-aced as we flew by the crazed crea-tures to and fro rush-ing about us our be-set boat was like a ship mobbed by ice isles in a tem-pest and striv-ing to steer through their com-pli-cat-ed chan-nels and straits know-ing not at what mo-ment it may be locked in and crushed But not a bit daunt-ed Quee-queg steered us man-ful-ly now sheer-ing off from this mon-ster di-rect-ly across our route in ad-vance now edg-ing away from that whose colos-sal flukes were sus-pend-ed over-head while all the time Star-buck stood up in the bows lance in hand prick-ing out of our way what-ev-er whales he could reach by short darts for there was no time to make long ones Nor were the oars-men quite idle though their wont-ed du-ty was now al-to-geth-er dis-pensed with They chiefly at-tend-ed to the shout-ing part of the busi-ness  Out of the way Com-modore  cried one to a great dromedary that of a sud-den rose bod-i-ly to the sur-face and for an in-stant threat-ened to swamp us  Hard down with your tail there  cried a sec-ond to an-oth-er which close to our gun-wale seemed calm-ly cool-ing him-self with his own fan like ex-trem-i-ty All whale-boats car-ry cer-tain cu-ri-ous con-trivances orig-i-nal-ly in-vent-ed by the Nan-tuck-et In-di-ans called drug-gs Two thick squares of wood of equal size are stout-ly clenched to-geth-er so that they cross each oth-er s grain at right an-gles a line of con-sid-er-able length is then at-tached to the mid-dle of this block and the oth-er end of the line be-ing looped it can in a mo-ment be fas-tened to a har-poon It is chiefly among gal-lied whales that this drugg is used For then more whales are close round you than you can pos-si-bly chase at one time But sperm whales are not ev-ery day en-coun-tered while you may then you must kill all you can And if you can-not kill them all at on-ce you must wing them so that they can be af-ter-wards killed at your leisure Hence it is that at times like the-se the drugg comes in-to req-ui-si-tion Our boat was fur-nished with three of them The first and sec-ond were suc-cess-ful-ly dart-ed and we saw the whales stag-ger-ing-ly run-ning off fet-tered by the enor-mous side-long re-sis-tance of the tow-ing drugg They were cramped like male-fac-tors with the chain and ball But up-on fling-ing the third in the act of toss-ing over-board the clum-sy wood-en block it caught un-der one of the seats of the boat and in an in-stant tore it out and car-ried it away drop-ping the oars-man in the boat s bot-tom as the seat slid from un-der him On both sides the sea came in at the wound-ed planks but we stuffed two or three draw-ers and shirts in and so stopped the leaks for the time It had been next to im-pos-si-ble to dart the-se drugged har-poons were it not that as we ad-vanced in-to the herd our whale s way great-ly di-min-ished more-over that as we went still fur-ther and fur-ther from the cir-cum-fer-ence of com-mo-tion the dire-ful dis-or-ders seemed wan-ing So that when at last the jerk-ing har-poon drew out and the tow-ing whale side-ways van-ished then with the ta-per-ing force of his part-ing mo-men-tum we glid-ed be-tween two whales in-to the in-ner-most heart of the shoal as if from some moun-tain tor-rent we had slid in-to a serene val-ley lake Here the stor-ms in the roar-ing glens be-tween the out-er-most whales were heard but not felt In this cen-tral ex-panse the sea pre-sent-ed that smooth sat-in like sur-face called a sleek pro-duced by the sub-tle mois-ture thrown off by the whale in his more qui-et moods Yes we were now in that en-chant-ed calm which they say lurks at the heart of ev-ery com-mo-tion And still in the dis-tract-ed dis-tance we be-held the tu-mults of the out-er con-cen-tric cir-cles and saw suc-ces-sive pods of whales eight or ten in each swift-ly go-ing round and round like mul-ti-plied spans of hors-es in a ring and so close-ly shoul-der to shoul-der that a Ti-tan-ic cir-cus rid-er might eas-i-ly have over arched the mid-dle ones and so have gone round on their backs Owing to the den-si-ty of the crowd of repos-ing whales more im-me-di-ate-ly sur-round-ing the em-bayed ax-is of the herd no pos-si-ble chance of es-cape was at pre-sent af-ford-ed us We must watch for a breach in the liv-ing wall that hemmed us in the wall that had on-ly ad-mit-ted us in or-der to shut us up Keep-ing at the cen-tre of the lake we were oc-ca-sion-al-ly vis-it-ed by small tame cows and calves the wom-en and chil-dren of this rout-ed host Now in-clu-sive of the oc-ca-sion-al wide in-ter-vals be-tween the re-volv-ing out-er cir-cles and in-clu-sive of the spaces be-tween the var-i-ous pods in any one of those cir-cles the en-tire area at this junc-ture em-braced by the whole mul-ti-tude must have con-tained at least two or three square miles At any rate though in-deed such a test at such a time might be de-cep-tive spout-ings might be dis-cov-ered from our low boat that seemed play-ing up al-most from the rim of the hori-zon I men-tion this cir-cum-stance be-cause as if the cows and calves had been pur-pose-ly locked up in this in-ner-most fold and as if the wide ex-tent of the herd had hith-er-to pre-vent-ed them from learn-ing the pre-cise cause of its stop-ping or pos-si-bly be-ing so young un-so-phis-ti-cat-ed and ev-ery way in-no-cent and in-ex-pe-ri-enced how-ev-er it may have been the-se small-er whales now and then vis-it-ing our be-calmed boat from the margin of the lake evinced a won-drous fear-less-ness and con-fi-dence or else a still becharmed pan-ic which it was im-pos-si-ble not to mar-vel at Like house-hold dogs they came snuf-fling round us right up to our gun-wales and touch-ing them till it al-most seemed that some spell had sud-den-ly do-mes-ti-cat-ed them Quee-queg pat-ted their fore-heads Star-buck scratched their backs with his lance but fear-ful of the con-se-quences for the time re-frained from dart-ing it But far be-neath this won-drous world up-on the sur-face an-oth-er and still stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side For sus-pend-ed in those wa-tery vaults float-ed the for-ms of the nurs-ing moth-ers of the whales and those that by their enor-mous girth seemed short-ly to be-come moth-ers The lake as I have hint-ed was to a con-sid-er-able depth ex-ceed-ing-ly trans-par-ent and as hu-man in-fan-ts while suck-ling will calm-ly and fixed-ly gaze away from the breast as if lead-ing two dif-fer-ent lives at the time and while yet draw-ing mor-tal nour-ish-ment be still spir-i-tu-al-ly feast-ing up-on some un-earth-ly rem-i-nis-cence  even so did the young of the-se whales seem look-ing up to-wards us but not at us as if we were but a bit of Gulfweed in their new born sight Float-ing on their sides the moth-ers al-so seemed qui-et-ly eye-ing us One of the-se lit-tle in-fan-ts that from cer-tain queer to-kens seemed hard-ly a day old might have mea-sured some four-teen feet in length and some six feet in girth He was a lit-tle frisky though as yet his body seemed scarce yet re-cov-ered from that irk-some po-si-tion it had so late-ly oc-cu-pied in the ma-ter-nal retic-ule where tail to head and all ready for the fi-nal spring the un-born whale lies bent like a Tar-tar s bow The del-i-cate side fins and the palms of his flukes still fresh-ly re-tained the plait-ed crum-pled ap-pear-ance of a baby s ears new-ly ar-rived from for-eign parts  Line line  cried Quee-queg look-ing over the gun-wale  him fast him fast  Who line him Who struck  Two whale one big one lit-tle   What ails ye man  cried Star-buck  Look e here  said Quee-queg point-ing down As when the strick-en whale that from the tub has reeled out hun-dreds of fath-oms of rope as af-ter deep sound-ing he floats up again and shows the slack-ened curling line buoy-ant-ly ris-ing and spi-ralling to-wards the air so now Star-buck saw long coils of the um-bil-i-cal cord of Madame Le-viathan by which the young cub seemed still teth-ered to its dam Not sel-dom in the rapid vi-cis-si-tudes of the chase this nat-u-ral line with the ma-ter-nal end loose be-comes en-tan-gled with the hempen one so that the cub is there-by trapped Some of the sub-tlest se-crets of the seas seemed di-vulged to us in this en-chant-ed pond We saw young Le-viathan amours in the deep The sperm whale as with all oth-er species of the Le-viathan but un-like most oth-er fish breeds in-dif-fer-ent-ly at all sea-sons af-ter a ges-ta-tion which may prob-a-bly be set down at nine months pro-duc-ing but one at a time though in some few known in-stances giv-ing birth to an Esau and Ja-cob  a con-tin-gen-cy pro-vid-ed for in suck-ling by two teats cu-ri-ous-ly sit-u-at-ed one on each side of the anus but the breasts them-selves ex-tend up-wards from that When by chance the-se pre-cious parts in a nurs-ing whale are cut by the hunter s lance the moth-er s pour-ing milk and blood ri-valling-ly dis-colour the sea for rods The milk is very sweet and rich it has been tast-ed by man it might do well with straw-ber-ries When over-flow-ing with mu-tu-al es-teem the whales salute more hominum And thus though sur-round-ed by cir-cle up-on cir-cle of con-ster-na-tions and af-frights did the-se in-scrutable crea-tures at the cen-tre freely and fear-less-ly in-dul-ge in all peace-ful con-cern-men-ts yea serene-ly rev-elled in dal-liance and de-light But even so amid the tor-na-doed At-lantic of my be-ing do I my-self still for ev-er cen-tral-ly dis-port in mute calm and while pon-der-ous plan-ets of un-wan-ing woe re-volve round me deep down and deep in-land there I still bathe me in eter-nal mild-ness of joy Mean-while as we thus lay en-tranced the oc-ca-sion-al sud-den fran-tic spec-ta-cles in the dis-tance evinced the ac-tiv-i-ty of the oth-er boats still en-gaged in drug-ging the whales on the fron-tier of the host or pos-si-bly car-ry-ing on the war with-in the first cir-cle where abun-dance of room and some con-ve-nient re-treats were af-ford-ed them But the sight of the en-raged drugged whales now and then blind-ly dart-ing to and fro across the cir-cles was noth-ing to what at last met our eyes It is some-times the cus-tom when fast to a whale more than com-mon-ly pow-er-ful and alert to seek to ham-string him as it were by sun-der-ing or maim-ing his gi-gan-tic tail ten-don It is done by dart-ing a short han-dled cut-ting spade to which is at-tached a rope for haul-ing it back again A whale wound-ed as we af-ter-wards learned in this part but not ef-fec-tu-al-ly as it seemed had bro-ken away from the boat car-ry-ing along with him half of the har-poon line and in the ex-traor-di-nary agony of the wound he was now dash-ing among the re-volv-ing cir-cles like the lone mount-ed des-per-ado Arnold at the bat-tle of Sarato-ga car-ry-ing dis-may wherever he went But ag-o-niz-ing as was the wound of this whale and an ap-palling spec-ta-cle enough any way yet the pe-cu-liar hor-ror with which he seemed to in-spire the rest of the herd was ow-ing to a cause which at first the in-ter-ven-ing dis-tance ob-scured from us But at length we per-ceived that by one of the unimag-in-able ac-ci-den-ts of the fish-ery this whale had be-come en-tan-gled in the har-poon line that he towed he had al-so run away with the cut-ting spade in him and while the free end of the rope at-tached to that weapon had per-ma-nent-ly caught in the coils of the har-poon line round his tail the cut-ting spade it-self had worked loose from his flesh So that tor-ment-ed to mad-ness he was now churn-ing through the wa-ter vi-o-lent-ly flail-ing with his flex-i-ble tail and toss-ing the keen spade about him wound-ing and mur-der-ing his own com-rades This ter-ri-fic ob-ject seemed to re-call the whole herd from their sta-tion-ary fright First the whales form-ing the margin of our lake be-gan to crowd a lit-tle and tum-ble again-st each oth-er as if lift-ed by half spent bil-lows from afar then the lake it-self be-gan faint-ly to heave and swell the sub-marine bridal cham-bers and nurs-eries van-ished in more and more con-tract-ing or-bits the whales in the more cen-tral cir-cles be-gan to swim in thick-en-ing clus-ters Yes the long calm was de-part-ing A low ad-vanc-ing hum was soon heard and then like to the tu-mul-tuous mass-es of block ice when the great river Hud-son breaks up in Spring the en-tire host of whales came tum-bling up-on their in-ner cen-tre as if to pile them-selves up in one com-mon moun-tain In-stant-ly Star-buck and Quee-queg changed places Star-buck tak-ing the stern  Oars Oars  he in-tense-ly whis-pered seiz-ing the helm  gripe your oars and clutch your souls now My God men stand by Shove him off you Quee-queg the whale there  prick him  hit him Stand up stand up and stay so Spring men pull men nev-er mind their back-s scrape them  scrape away  The boat was now all but jammed be-tween two vast black bulks leav-ing a nar-row Dar-danelles be-tween their long lengths But by des-per-ate en-deav-or we at last shot in-to a tem-po-rary open-ing then giv-ing way rapid-ly and at the same time earnest-ly watch-ing for an-oth-er out-let After many sim-i-lar hair breadth es-capes we at last swift-ly glid-ed in-to what had just been one of the out-er cir-cles but now crossed by ran-dom whales all vi-o-lent-ly mak-ing for one cen-tre This lucky sal-va-tion was cheap-ly pur-chased by the loss of Quee-queg s hat who while stand-ing in the bows to prick the fugi-tive whales had his hat tak-en clean from his head by the air ed-dy made by the sud-den toss-ing of a pair of broad flukes close by Riotous and dis-or-dered as the uni-ver-sal com-mo-tion now was it soon re-solved it-self in-to what seemed a sys-tem-at-ic move-ment for hav-ing clumped to-geth-er at last in one dense body they then re-newed their on-ward flight with aug-ment-ed fleet-ness Fur-ther pur-suit was use-less but the boats still lin-gered in their wake to pick up what drugged whales might be dropped astern and like-wise to se-cure one which Flask had killed and waifed The waif is a pen-noned pole two or three of which are car-ried by ev-ery boat and which when ad-di-tion-al game is at hand are in-sert-ed up-right in-to the float-ing body of a dead whale both to mark its place on the sea and al-so as to-ken of pri-or pos-ses-sion should the boats of any oth-er ship draw near The re-sult of this low-er-ing was some-what il-lus-tra-tive of that saga-cious say-ing in the Fish-ery  the more whales the less fish Of all the drugged whales on-ly one was cap-tured The rest con-trived to es-cape for the time but on-ly to be tak-en as will here-after be seen by some oth-er craft than the Pe-quod CHAPTER 88 Schools and School-mas-ters The pre-vi-ous chap-ter gave ac-count of an im-mense body or herd of Sperm Whales and there was al-so then given the prob-a-ble cause in-duc-ing those vast ag-gre-ga-tions Now though such great bod-ies are at times en-coun-tered yet as must have been seen even at the pre-sent day small de-tached bands are oc-ca-sion-al-ly ob-served em-brac-ing from twen-ty to fifty in-di-vid-u-als each Such bands are known as schools They gen-er-al-ly are of two sorts those com-posed al-most en-tire-ly of fe-males and those mus-ter-ing none but young vig-or-ous males or bul-ls as they are fa-mil-iar-ly des-ig-nat-ed In cav-a-lier at-ten-dance up-on the school of fe-males you in-vari-ably see a male of full grown mag-ni-tude but not old who up-on any alarm evinces his gal-lantry by falling in the rear and cov-er-ing the flight of his ladies In truth this gen-tle-man is a lux-u-ri-ous Ot-toman swim-ming about over the wa-tery world sur-round-ing-ly ac-com-pa-nied by all the so-laces and en-dear-men-ts of the harem The con-trast be-tween this Ot-toman and his con-cu-bi-nes is strik-ing be-cause while he is al-ways of the largest leviathanic pro-por-tions the ladies even at full growth are not more than one third of the bulk of an av-er-age sized male They are com-par-a-tive-ly del-i-cate in-deed I dare say not to ex-ceed half a dozen yards round the waist Nev-er-the-less it can-not be de-nied that up-on the whole they are hered-i-tar-i-ly en-ti-tled to en bon point It is very cu-ri-ous to watch this harem and its lord in their in-do-lent ram-blings Like fash-ion-ables they are for ev-er on the move in leisure-ly search of va-ri-ety You meet them on the Line in time for the full flow-er of the Equa-to-ri-al feed-ing sea-son hav-ing just re-turned per-haps from spend-ing the sum-mer in the North-ern seas and so cheat-ing sum-mer of all un-pleas-ant weari-ness and warmth By the time they have lounged up and down the prom-e-nade of the Equa-tor awhile they start for the Ori-en-tal wa-ters in an-tic-i-pa-tion of the cool sea-son there and so evade the oth-er ex-ces-sive tem-per-a-ture of the year When serene-ly ad-vanc-ing on one of the-se jour-neys if any strange sus-pi-cious sights are seen my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his in-ter-est-ing fam-i-ly Should any un-war-rantably pert young Le-viathan com-ing that way pre-sume to draw con-fi-den-tial-ly close to one of the ladies with what prodi-gious fury the Bashaw as-sails him and chas-es him away High times in-deed if un-prin-ci-pled young rakes like him are to be per-mit-ted to in-vade the sanc-ti-ty of do-mes-tic bliss though do what the Bashaw will he can-not keep the most no-to-ri-ous Lothar-io out of his bed for alas all fish bed in com-mon As ashore the ladies of-ten cause the most ter-ri-ble du-els among their ri-val ad-mir-ers just so with the whales who some-times come to dead-ly bat-tle and all for love They fence with their long low-er jaws some-times lock-ing them to-geth-er and so striv-ing for the suprema-cy like elks that war-ring-ly in-ter-weave their antlers Not a few are cap-tured hav-ing the deep scars of the-se en-coun-ters  fur-rowed heads bro-ken teeth scol-loped fins and in some in-stances wrenched and dis-lo-cat-ed mouths But sup-pos-ing the in-vader of do-mes-tic bliss to be-take him-self away at the first rush of the harem s lord then is it very di-vert-ing to watch that lord Gent-ly he in-sin-u-ates his vast bulk among them again and rev-els there awhile still in tan-ta-liz-ing vicin-i-ty to young Lothar-io like pi-ous Solomon de-vout-ly wor-ship-ping among his thou-sand con-cu-bi-nes Grant-ing oth-er whales to be in sight the fish-er-men will sel-dom give chase to one of the-se Grand Turks for the-se Grand Turks are too lav-ish of their strength and hence their unc-tu-ous-ness is small As for the sons and the daugh-ters they beget why those sons and daugh-ters must take care of them-selves at least with on-ly the ma-ter-nal help For like cer-tain oth-er om-niv-o-rous rov-ing lovers that might be named my Lord Whale has no taste for the nurs-ery how-ev-er much for the bow-er and so be-ing a great trav-eller he leaves his anony-mous ba-bies all over the world ev-ery baby an ex-otic In good time nev-er-the-less as the ar-dour of youth de-cli-nes as years and dumps in-crease as re-flec-tion lends her solemn paus-es in short as a gen-er-al las-si-tude over-takes the sat-ed Turk then a love of ease and virtue sup-plan-ts the love for maid-ens our Ot-toman en-ters up-on the im-po-tent re-pen-tant ad-mon-i-to-ry stage of life for-swears dis-bands the harem and grown to an ex-em-plary sulky old soul goes about all alone among the merid-i-ans and par-al-lels say-ing his prayers and warn-ing each young Le-viathan from his amorous er-rors Now as the harem of whales is called by the fish-er-men a school so is the lord and mas-ter of that school tech-ni-cal-ly known as the school-mas-ter It is there-fore not in strict char-ac-ter how-ev-er ad-mirably satir-i-cal that af-ter go-ing to school him-self he should then go abroad in-cul-cat-ing not what he learned there but the fol-ly of it His ti-tle school-mas-ter would very nat-u-ral-ly seem de-rived from the name be-stowed up-on the harem it-self but some have sur-mised that the man who first thus en-ti-tled this sort of Ot-toman whale must have read the mem-oirs of Vi-docq and in-formed him-self what sort of a coun-try school-mas-ter that fa-mous French-man was in his younger days and what was the na-ture of those oc-cult lessons he in-cul-cat-ed in-to some of his pupils The same se-clud-ed-ness and iso-la-tion to which the school-mas-ter whale be-takes him-self in his ad-vanc-ing years is true of all aged Sperm Whales Al-most uni-ver-sal-ly a lone whale as a soli-tary Le-viathan is called proves an an-cient one Like ven-er-a-ble moss beard-ed Daniel Boone he will have no one near him but Na-ture her-self and her he takes to wife in the wilder-ness of wa-ters and the best of wives she is though she keeps so many moody se-crets The schools com-pos-ing none but young and vig-or-ous males pre-vi-ous-ly men-tioned of-fer a strong con-trast to the harem schools For while those fe-male whales are char-ac-ter-is-ti-cal-ly timid the young males or forty bar-rel bul-ls as they call them are by far the most pug-na-cious of all Le-viathans and prover-bial-ly the most dan-ger-ous to en-coun-ter ex-cept-ing those won-drous grey head-ed griz-zled whales some-times met and the-se will fight you like grim fiends ex-as-per-at-ed by a pe-nal gout The Forty bar-rel bull schools are larg-er than the harem schools Like a mob of young col-le-gians they are full of fight fun and wicked-ness tum-bling round the world at such a reck-less rol-lick-ing rate that no pru-dent un-der-writer would in-sure them any more than he would a ri-otous lad at Yale or Har-vard They soon re-lin-quish this tur-bu-lence though and when about three fourths grown break up and sep-a-rate-ly go about in quest of set-tle-men-ts that is harems Another point of dif-fer-ence be-tween the male and fe-male schools is still more char-ac-ter-is-tic of the sex-es Say you strike a Forty bar-rel bul-l poor dev-il all his com-rades quit him But strike a mem-ber of the harem school and her com-pan-ions swim around her with ev-ery to-ken of con-cern some-times lin-ger-ing so near her and so long as them-selves to fall a prey CHAPTER 89 Fast Fish and Loose Fish The al-lu-sion to the waif and waif poles in the last chap-ter but one ne-ces-si-tates some ac-count of the laws and reg-u-la-tions of the whale fish-ery of which the waif may be deemed the grand sym-bol and badge It fre-quent-ly hap-pens that when sev-er-al ships are cruis-ing in com-pa-ny a whale may be struck by one ves-sel then es-cape and be fi-nal-ly killed and cap-tured by an-oth-er ves-sel and here-in are in-di-rect-ly com-prised many mi-nor con-tin-gen-cies all par-tak-ing of this one grand fea-ture For ex-am-ple  af-ter a weary and per-ilous chase and cap-ture of a whale the body may get loose from the ship by rea-son of a vi-o-lent storm and drift-ing far away to lee-ward be re-tak-en by a sec-ond whaler who in a calm snug-ly tows it alongside with-out risk of life or line Thus the most vex-a-tious and vi-o-lent dis-putes would of-ten arise be-tween the fish-er-men were there not some writ-ten or un-writ-ten uni-ver-sal undis-put-ed law ap-pli-ca-ble to all cas-es Per-haps the on-ly for-mal whal-ing code au-tho-rized by leg-isla-tive en-act-ment was that of Hol-land It was de-creed by the States Gen-er-al in A D 1695 But though no oth-er na-tion has ev-er had any writ-ten whal-ing law yet the Amer-i-can fish-er-men have been their own leg-is-la-tors and lawyers in this mat-ter They have pro-vid-ed a sys-tem which for terse com-pre-hen-sive-ness sur-pass-es Jus-tini-an s Pan-dec-ts and the By laws of the Chi-ne-se So-ci-ety for the Sup-pres-sion of Med-dling with oth-er Peo-ple s Busi-ness Yes the-se laws might be en-graven on a Queen An-ne s far-thing or the barb of a har-poon and worn round the neck so small are they I A Fast Fish be-longs to the par-ty fast to it II A Loose Fish is fair game for any-body who can soon-est catch it But what plays the mis-chief with this mas-ter-ly code is the ad-mirable brevi-ty of it which ne-ces-si-tates a vast vol-ume of com-men-taries to ex-pound it First What is a Fast Fish Alive or dead a fish is tech-ni-cal-ly fast when it is con-nect-ed with an oc-cu-pied ship or boat by any medi-um at all con-trol-lable by the oc-cu-pant or oc-cu-pan-ts  a mast an oar a nine inch ca-ble a tele-graph wire or a strand of cob-web it is all the same Like-wise a fish is tech-ni-cal-ly fast when it bears a waif or any oth-er recog-nised sym-bol of pos-ses-sion so long as the par-ty waif-ing it plain-ly evince their abil-i-ty at any time to take it alongside as well as their in-ten-tion so to do Th-e-se are sci-en-tific com-men-taries but the com-men-taries of the whale-men them-selves some-times con-sist in hard words and hard-er knock-s the Coke up-on Lit-tle-ton of the fist True among the more up-right and hon-or-able whale-men al-lowances are al-ways made for pe-cu-liar cas-es where it would be an out-ra-geous moral in-jus-tice for one par-ty to claim pos-ses-sion of a whale pre-vi-ous-ly chased or killed by an-oth-er par-ty But oth-ers are by no means so scrupu-lous Some fifty years ago there was a cu-ri-ous case of whale tro-ver lit-i-gat-ed in Eng-land where-in the plain-tiffs set forth that af-ter a hard chase of a whale in the North-ern seas and when in-deed they the plain-tiffs had suc-ceed-ed in har-poon-ing the fish they were at last through per-il of their lives obliged to for-sake not on-ly their lines but their boat it-self Ul-ti-mate-ly the de-fen-dan-ts the crew of an-oth-er ship came up with the whale struck killed seized and fi-nal-ly ap-pro-pri-at-ed it be-fore the very eyes of the plain-tiffs And when those de-fen-dan-ts were re-mon-strat-ed with their cap-tain snapped his fin-gers in the plain-tiff-s teeth and as-sured them that by way of dox-ol-o-gy to the deed he had done he would now re-tain their line har-poons and boat which had re-mained at-tached to the whale at the time of the seizure Where-fore the plain-tiffs now sued for the re-cov-ery of the val-ue of their whale line har-poons and boat Mr Ersk-ine was coun-sel for the de-fen-dan-ts Lord El-len-bor-ough was the judge In the course of the de-fence the wit-ty Ersk-ine went on to il-lus-trate his po-si-tion by al-lud-ing to a re-cent crim con case where-in a gen-tle-man af-ter in vain try-ing to bri-dle his wife s vi-cious-ness had at last aban-doned her up-on the seas of life but in the course of years re-pent-ing of that step he in-sti-tut-ed an ac-tion to re-cov-er pos-ses-sion of her Ersk-ine was on the oth-er side and he then sup-port-ed it by say-ing that though the gen-tle-man had orig-i-nal-ly har-pooned the la-dy and had on-ce had her fast and on-ly by rea-son of the great stress of her plung-ing vi-cious-ness had at last aban-doned her yet aban-don her he did so that she be-came a loose fish and there-fore when a sub-se-quent gen-tle-man re har-pooned her the la-dy then be-came that sub-se-quent gen-tle-man s prop-er-ty along with what-ev-er har-poon might have been found stick-ing in her Now in the pre-sent case Ersk-ine con-tend-ed that the ex-am-ples of the whale and the la-dy were re-cip-ro-cal-ly il-lus-tra-tive of each oth-er Th-e-se plead-ings and the coun-ter plead-ings be-ing du-ly heard the very learned judge in set ter-ms de-cid-ed to wit  That as for the boat he award-ed it to the plain-tiffs be-cause they had mere-ly aban-doned it to save their lives but that with re-gard to the con-tro-vert-ed whale har-poons and line they be-longed to the de-fen-dan-ts the whale be-cause it was a Loose Fish at the time of the fi-nal cap-ture and the har-poons and line be-cause when the fish made off with them it the fish ac-quired a prop-er-ty in those ar-ti-cles and hence any-body who af-ter-wards took the fish had a right to them Now the de-fen-dan-ts af-ter-wards took the fish er-go the afore-said ar-ti-cles were theirs A com-mon man look-ing at this de-ci-sion of the very learned Judge might pos-si-bly ob-ject to it But ploughed up to the pri-ma-ry rock of the mat-ter the two great prin-ci-ples laid down in the twin whal-ing laws pre-vi-ous-ly quot-ed and ap-plied and elu-ci-dat-ed by Lord El-len-bor-ough in the above cit-ed case the-se two laws touch-ing Fast Fish and Loose Fish I say will on re-flec-tion be found the fun-da-men-tals of all hu-man ju-rispru-dence for notwith-stand-ing its com-pli-cat-ed trac-ery of sculp-ture the Tem-ple of the Law like the Tem-ple of the Philisti-nes has but two props to stand on Is it not a say-ing in ev-ery one s mouth Posses-sion is half of the law that is re-gard-less of how the thing came in-to pos-ses-sion But of-ten pos-ses-sion is the whole of the law What are the sinews and souls of Rus-sian serfs and Repub-li-can slaves but Fast Fish where-of pos-ses-sion is the whole of the law What to the ra-pa-cious land-lord is the wid-ow s last mite but a Fast Fish What is yon-der un-de-tect-ed vil-lain s mar-ble man-sion with a door plate for a waif what is that but a Fast Fish What is the ru-inous dis-count which Morde-cai the bro-ker gets from poor Woe-be-gone the bankrupt on a loan to keep Woe-be-gone s fam-i-ly from star-va-tion what is that ru-inous dis-count but a Fast Fish What is the Arch-bish-op of Savesoul s in-come of  1  seized from the scant bread and cheese of hun-dreds of thou-sands of bro-ken backed la-bor-ers all sure of heav-en with-out any of Savesoul s help what is that glob-u-lar  1  but a Fast Fish What are the Duke of Dun-der s hered-i-tary towns and ham-lets but Fast Fish What to that re-doubt-ed har-pooneer John Bull is poor Ire-land but a Fast Fish What to that apos-tolic lancer Brother Jonathan is Tex-as but a Fast Fish And con-cern-ing all the-se is not Posses-sion the whole of the law But if the doc-trine of Fast Fish be pret-ty gen-er-al-ly ap-pli-ca-ble the kin-dred doc-trine of Loose Fish is still more wide-ly so That is in-ter-na-tion-al-ly and uni-ver-sal-ly ap-pli-ca-ble What was Amer-i-ca in 1492 but a Loose Fish in which Colum-bus struck the Span-ish stan-dard by way of waif-ing it for his roy-al mas-ter and mis-tress What was Poland to the Czar What Greece to the Turk What In-dia to Eng-land What at last will Mex-i-co be to the Unit-ed States All Loose Fish What are the Rights of Man and the Lib-er-ties of the World but Loose Fish What all men s minds and opin-ions but Loose Fish What is the prin-ci-ple of re-li-gious be-lief in them but a Loose Fish What to the os-ten-ta-tious smug-gling ver-bal-ists are the thoughts of thinkers but Loose Fish What is the great globe it-self but a Loose Fish And what are you read-er but a Loose Fish and a Fast Fish too CHAPTER 9 Heads or Tails  De bale-na vero suf-ficit si rex habeat ca-put et regi-na cau-dam  Brac-ton l 3 c 3 Lat-in from the books of the Laws of Eng-land which tak-en along with the con-text means that of all whales cap-tured by any-body on the coast of that land the King as Honorary Grand Har-pooneer must have the head and the Queen be re-spect-ful-ly pre-sent-ed with the tail A di-vi-sion which in the whale is much like halv-ing an ap-ple there is no in-ter-me-di-ate re-main-der Now as this law un-der a mod-i-fied form is to this day in force in Eng-land and as it of-fers in var-i-ous re-spec-ts a strange anoma-ly touch-ing the gen-er-al law of Fast and Loose Fish it is here treat-ed of in a sep-a-rate chap-ter on the same cour-te-ous prin-ci-ple that promp-ts the English rail-ways to be at the ex-pense of a sep-a-rate car spe-cial-ly re-served for the ac-com-mo-da-tion of roy-al-ty In the first place in cu-ri-ous proof of the fact that the above men-tioned law is still in force I pro-ceed to lay be-fore you a cir-cum-stance that hap-pened with-in the last two years It seems that some hon-est mariners of Dover or Sand-wich or some one of the Cin-que Ports had af-ter a hard chase suc-ceed-ed in killing and beach-ing a fine whale which they had orig-i-nal-ly de-scried afar off from the shore Now the Cin-que Ports are par-tial-ly or some-how un-der the ju-ris-dic-tion of a sort of po-lice-man or beadle called a Lord War-den Hold-ing the of-fice di-rect-ly from the crown I be-lieve all the roy-al emol-u-men-ts in-ci-dent to the Cin-que Port ter-ri-to-ries be-come by as-sign-ment his By some writ-ers this of-fice is called a sinecure But not so Be-cause the Lord War-den is busi-ly em-ployed at times in fob-bing his perquisites which are his chiefly by virtue of that same fob-bing of them Now when the-se poor sun burnt mariners bare foot-ed and with their trowsers rolled high up on their eely legs had weari-ly hauled their fat fish high and dry promis-ing them-selves a good  15 from the pre-cious oil and bone and in fan-ta-sy sip-ping rare tea with their wives and good ale with their cronies up-on the strength of their re-spec-tive shares up steps a very learned and most Chris-tian and char-i-ta-ble gen-tle-man with a copy of Black-stone un-der his arm and lay-ing it up-on the whale s head he says  Hands off this fish my mas-ters is a Fast Fish I seize it as the Lord War-den s  Upon this the poor mariners in their re-spect-ful con-ster-na-tion so tru-ly English know-ing not what to say fall to vig-or-ous-ly scratch-ing their heads all round mean-while rue-ful-ly glanc-ing from the whale to the stranger But that did in no-wise mend the mat-ter or at all soft-en the hard heart of the learned gen-tle-man with the copy of Black-stone At length one of them af-ter long scratch-ing about for his ideas made bold to speak  Please sir who is the Lord War-den   The Duke   But the duke had noth-ing to do with tak-ing this fish   It is his   We have been at great trou-ble and per-il and some ex-pense and is all that to go to the Duke s ben-e-fit we get-ting noth-ing at all for our pains but our blis-ters   It is his   Is the Duke so very poor as to be forced to this des-per-ate mode of get-ting a liveli-hood   It is his   I thought to re-lieve my old bed rid-den moth-er by part of my share of this whale   It is his   Won t the Duke be con-tent with a quar-ter or a half   It is his  In a word the whale was seized and sold and his Grace the Duke of Welling-ton re-ceived the mon-ey Think-ing that viewed in some par-tic-u-lar lights the case might by a bare pos-si-bil-i-ty in some small de-gree be deemed un-der the cir-cum-stances a rather hard one an hon-est cler-gy-man of the town re-spect-ful-ly ad-dressed a note to his Grace beg-ging him to take the case of those un-for-tu-nate mariners in-to full con-sid-er-a-tion To which my Lord Duke in sub-stance replied both let-ters were pub-lished that he had al-ready done so and re-ceived the mon-ey and would be obliged to the rev-erend gen-tle-man if for the fu-ture he the rev-erend gen-tle-man would de-cline med-dling with oth-er peo-ple s busi-ness Is this the still mil-i-tant old man stand-ing at the cor-ners of the three king-doms on all hands co-erc-ing alms of beg-gars It will read-i-ly be seen that in this case the al-leged right of the Duke to the whale was a del-e-gat-ed one from the Sovereign We must needs in-quire then on what prin-ci-ple the Sovereign is orig-i-nal-ly in-vest-ed with that right The law it-self has al-ready been set forth But Plow-don gives us the rea-son for it Says Plow-don the whale so caught be-longs to the King and Queen  be-cause of its su-pe-ri-or ex-cel-lence  And by the soundest com-men-ta-tors this has ev-er been held a co-gent ar-gu-ment in such mat-ters But why should the King have the head and the Queen the tail A rea-son for that ye lawyers In his trea-tise on  Queen Gold  or Queen pin-money an old King s Bench au-thor one Wil-liam Pryn-ne thus dis-courseth  Ye tail is ye Queen s that ye Queen s wardrobe may be sup-plied with ye whale-bone  Now this was writ-ten at a time when the black lim-ber bone of the Green-land or Right whale was large-ly used in ladies bodices But this same bone is not in the tail it is in the head which is a sad mis-take for a saga-cious lawyer like Pryn-ne But is the Queen a mer-maid to be pre-sent-ed with a tail An al-le-gor-i-cal mean-ing may lurk here There are two roy-al fish so styled by the English law writ-er-s the whale and the stur-geon both roy-al prop-er-ty un-der cer-tain lim-i-ta-tions and nom-i-nal-ly sup-ply-ing the ten-th branch of the crown s or-di-nary rev-enue I know not that any oth-er au-thor has hint-ed of the mat-ter but by in-fer-ence it seems to me that the stur-geon must be di-vid-ed in the same way as the whale the King re-ceiv-ing the high-ly dense and elas-tic head pe-cu-liar to that fish which sym-bol-i-cal-ly re-gard-ed may pos-si-bly be hu-mor-ous-ly ground-ed up-on some pre-sumed con-ge-nial-i-ty And thus there seems a rea-son in all things even in law CHAPTER 91 The Pe-quod Meets The Rose Bud  In vain it was to rake for Am-ber-griese in the paunch of this Le-viathan in-suf-fer-able fe-tor deny-ing not in-quiry  Sir T Browne V E It was a week or two af-ter the last whal-ing scene re-count-ed and when we were slow-ly sail-ing over a sleepy va-pory mid day sea that the many noses on the Pe-quod s deck proved more vig-i-lant dis-cov-er-ers than the three pairs of eyes aloft A pe-cu-liar and not very pleas-ant smell was smelt in the sea  I will bet some-thing now  said Stubb  that some-where here-abouts are some of those drugged whales we tick-led the oth-er day I thought they would keel up be-fore long  Present-ly the va-pors in ad-vance slid aside and there in the dis-tance lay a ship whose furled sails be-to-kened that some sort of whale must be alongside As we glid-ed nearer the stranger showed French colours from his peak and by the ed-dy-ing cloud of vul-ture sea fowl that cir-cled and hov-ered and swooped around him it was plain that the whale alongside must be what the fish-er-men call a blast-ed whale that is a whale that has died un-mo-lest-ed on the sea and so float-ed an un-ap-pro-pri-at-ed corpse It may well be con-ceived what an un-sa-vory odor such a mass must ex-hale worse than an Assyr-i-an city in the plague when the liv-ing are in-com-pe-tent to bury the de-part-ed So in-tol-er-a-ble in-deed is it re-gard-ed by some that no cu-pid-i-ty could per-suade them to moor alongside of it Yet are there those who will still do it notwith-stand-ing the fact that the oil ob-tained from such sub-jec-ts is of a very in-fe-ri-or qual-i-ty and by no means of the na-ture of at-tar of rose Com-ing still nearer with the ex-pir-ing breeze we saw that the French-man had a sec-ond whale alongside and this sec-ond whale seemed even more of a nosegay than the first In truth it turned out to be one of those prob-lem-at-i-cal whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort of prodi-gious dys-pep-sia or in-di-ges-tion leav-ing their de-funct bod-ies al-most en-tire-ly bankrupt of any-thing like oil Nev-er-the-less in the prop-er place we shall see that no know-ing fish-er-man will ev-er turn up his nose at such a whale as this how-ev-er much he may shun blast-ed whales in gen-er-al The Pe-quod had now swept so nigh to the stranger that Stubb vowed he recog-nised his cut-ting spade pole en-tan-gled in the lines that were knot-ted round the tail of one of the-se whales  There s a pret-ty fel-low now  he ban-ter-ing-ly laughed stand-ing in the ship s bows  there s a jack-al for ye I well know that the-se Crap-poes of French-men are but poor dev-ils in the fish-ery some-times low-er-ing their boats for break-ers mis-tak-ing them for Sperm Whale spouts yes and some-times sail-ing from their port with their hold full of box-es of tal-low can-dles and cas-es of snuffers fore-see-ing that all the oil they will get won t be enough to dip the Cap-tain s wick in-to aye we all know the-se things but look ye here s a Crap-po that is con-tent with our leav-ings the drugged whale there I mean aye and is con-tent too with scrap-ing the dry bones of that oth-er pre-cious fish he has there Poor dev-il I say pass round a hat some one and let s make him a pre-sent of a lit-tle oil for dear char-i-ty s sake For what oil he ll get from that drugged whale there would-n t be fit to burn in a jail no not in a con-demned cell And as for the oth-er whale why I ll agree to get more oil by chop-ping up and try-ing out the-se three mas-ts of ours than he ll get from that bundle of bones though now that I think of it it may con-tain some-thing worth a good deal more than oil yes am-ber-gris I won-der now if our old man has thought of that It s worth try-ing Yes I m for it  and so say-ing he start-ed for the quar-ter deck By this time the faint air had be-come a com-plete calm so that whether or no the Pe-quod was now fair-ly en-trapped in the smell with no hope of es-cap-ing ex-cept by its breez-ing up again Is-su-ing from the cab-in Stubb now called his boat s crew and pulled off for the stranger Draw-ing across her bow he per-ceived that in ac-cor-dance with the fan-ci-ful French taste the up-per part of her stem piece was carved in the like-ness of a huge droop-ing stalk was paint-ed green and for thorns had cop-per spikes pro-ject-ing from it here and there the whole ter-mi-nat-ing in a sym-met-ri-cal fold-ed bulb of a bright red colour Upon her head boards in large gilt let-ters he read  Bou-ton de Rose   Rose but-ton or Rose bud and this was the ro-man-tic name of this aro-mat-ic ship Though Stubb did not un-der-stand the Bou-ton part of the in-scrip-tion yet the word rose and the bul-bous fig-ure head put to-geth-er suf-fi-cient-ly ex-plained the whole to him  A wood-en rose bud eh  he cried with his hand to his nose  that will do very well but how like all cre-ation it smells  Now in or-der to hold di-rect com-mu-ni-ca-tion with the peo-ple on deck he had to pull round the bows to the star-board side and thus come close to the blast-ed whale and so talk over it Ar-rived then at this spot with one hand still to his nose he bawled  Bou-ton de Rose ahoy are there any of you Bou-ton de Ros-es that speak English   Yes  re-joined a Guernsey man from the bul-warks who turned out to be the chief mate  Well then my Bou-ton de Rose bud have you seen the White Whale   What whale   The White Whale a Sperm Whale Moby Dick have ye seen him  Nev-er heard of such a whale Cachalot Blanche White Whale no   Very good then good bye now and I ll call again in a min-ute  Then rapid-ly pulling back to-wards the Pe-quod and see-ing Ahab lean-ing over the quar-ter deck rail await-ing his re-port he mould-ed his two hands in-to a trum-pet and shout-ed  No Sir No  Upon which Ahab re-tired and Stubb re-turned to the French-man He now per-ceived that the Guernsey man who had just got in-to the chains and was us-ing a cut-ting spade had slung his nose in a sort of bag  What s the mat-ter with your nose there  said Stubb  Broke it   I wish it was bro-ken or that I did-n t have any nose at all  an-swered the Guernsey man who did not seem to rel-ish the job he was at very much  But what are you hold-ing yours for   Oh noth-ing It s a wax nose I have to hold it on Fine day ain t it Air rather gar-den-ny I should say throw us a bunch of posies will ye Bou-ton de Rose   What in the dev-il s name do you want here  roared the Guernsey-man fly-ing in-to a sud-den pas-sion  Oh keep cool cool yes that s the word why don t you pack those whales in ice while you re work-ing at  em But jok-ing aside though do you know Rose bud that it s all non-sense try-ing to get any oil out of such whales As for that dried up one there he has-n t a gill in his whole car-case   I know that well enough but d ye see the Cap-tain here won t be-lieve it this is his first voy-age he was a Cologne man-u-fac-turer be-fore But come aboard and may-hap he ll be-lieve you if he won t me and so I ll get out of this dirty scrape   Any-thing to oblige ye my sweet and pleas-ant fel-low  re-joined Stubb and with that he soon mount-ed to the deck There a queer scene pre-sent-ed it-self The sailors in tas-selled caps of red worsted were get-ting the heavy tack-les in readi-ness for the whales But they worked rather slow and talked very fast and seemed in any-thing but a good hu-mor All their noses up-ward-ly pro-ject-ed from their faces like so many jib booms Now and then pairs of them would drop their work and run up to the mast head to get some fresh air Some think-ing they would catch the plague dipped oakum in coal tar and at in-ter-vals held it to their nos-trils Others hav-ing bro-ken the stems of their pipes al-most short off at the bowl were vig-or-ous-ly puff-ing to-bac-co smoke so that it con-stant-ly filled their ol-fac-to-ries Stubb was struck by a show-er of out-cries and anath-e-mas pro-ceed-ing from the Cap-tain s round house abaft and look-ing in that di-rec-tion saw a fiery face thrust from be-hind the door which was held ajar from with-in This was the tor-ment-ed sur-geon who af-ter in vain re-mon-strat-ing again-st the pro-ceed-ings of the day had be-tak-en him-self to the Cap-tain s round house cab-i-net he called it to avoid the pest but still could not help yelling out his en-treaties and in-dig-na-tions at times Mark-ing all this Stubb ar-gued well for his scheme and turn-ing to the Guernsey man had a lit-tle chat with him dur-ing which the stranger mate ex-pressed his de-tes-ta-tion of his Cap-tain as a con-ceit-ed ig-no-ra-mus who had brought them all in-to so un-sa-vory and un-prof-itable a pick-le Sound-ing him care-ful-ly Stubb fur-ther per-ceived that the Guernsey man had not the slight-est sus-pi-cion con-cern-ing the am-ber-gris He there-fore held his peace on that head but oth-er-wise was quite frank and con-fi-den-tial with him so that the two quick-ly con-coct-ed a lit-tle plan for both cir-cum-vent-ing and sat-i-riz-ing the Cap-tain with-out his at all dream-ing of dis-trust-ing their sin-cer-i-ty Ac-cord-ing to this lit-tle plan of theirs the Guernsey man un-der cov-er of an in-ter-preter s of-fice was to tell the Cap-tain what he pleased but as com-ing from Stubb and as for Stubb he was to ut-ter any non-sense that should come up-per-most in him dur-ing the in-ter-view By this time their des-tined vic-tim ap-peared from his cab-in He was a small and dark but rather del-i-cate look-ing man for a sea cap-tain with large whiskers and mous-tache how-ev-er and wore a red cot-ton velvet vest with watch seals at his side To this gen-tle-man Stubb was now po-lite-ly in-tro-duced by the Guernsey man who at on-ce os-ten-ta-tious-ly put on the as-pect of in-ter-pret-ing be-tween them  What shall I say to him first  said he  Why  said Stubb eye-ing the velvet vest and the watch and seals  you may as well be-gin by telling him that he looks a sort of baby-ish to me though I don t pre-tend to be a judge   He says Mon-sieur  said the Guernsey man in French turn-ing to his cap-tain  that on-ly yes-ter-day his ship spoke a ves-sel whose cap-tain and chief mate with six sailors had all died of a fever caught from a blast-ed whale they had brought alongside  Upon this the cap-tain start-ed and ea-ger-ly de-sired to know more  What now  said the Guernsey man to Stubb  Why since he takes it so easy tell him that now I have eyed him care-ful-ly I m quite cer-tain that he s no more fit to com-mand a whale ship than a St Jago mon-key In fact tell him from me he s a ba-boon   He vows and de-clares Mon-sieur that the oth-er whale the dried one is far more dead-ly than the blast-ed one in fine Mon-sieur he con-jures us as we val-ue our lives to cut loose from the-se fish  In-stant-ly the cap-tain ran for-ward and in a loud voice com-mand-ed his crew to de-sist from hoist-ing the cut-ting tack-les and at on-ce cast loose the ca-bles and chains con-fin-ing the whales to the ship  What now  said the Guernsey man when the Cap-tain had re-turned to them  Why let me see yes you may as well tell him now that that in fact tell him I ve did-dled him and aside to him-self per-haps some-body else   He says Mon-sieur that he s very hap-py to have been of any ser-vice to us  Hear-ing this the cap-tain vowed that they were the grate-ful par-ties mean-ing him-self and mate and con-clud-ed by invit-ing Stubb down in-to his cab-in to drink a bot-tle of Bordeaux  He wan-ts you to take a glass of wine with him  said the in-ter-preter  Thank him hearti-ly but tell him it s again-st my prin-ci-ples to drink with the man I ve did-dled In fact tell him I must go   He says Mon-sieur that his prin-ci-ples won t ad-mit of his drink-ing but that if Mon-sieur wan-ts to live an-oth-er day to drink then Mon-sieur had best drop all four boats and pull the ship away from the-se whales for it s so calm they won t drift  By this time Stubb was over the side and get-ting in-to his boat hailed the Guernsey man to this ef-fect  that hav-ing a long tow line in his boat he would do what he could to help them by pulling out the lighter whale of the two from the ship s side While the French-man s boats then were en-gaged in tow-ing the ship one way Stubb benev-o-lent-ly towed away at his whale the oth-er way os-ten-ta-tious-ly slack-ing out a most un-usu-al-ly long tow line Present-ly a breeze sprang up Stubb feigned to cast off from the whale hoist-ing his boats the French-man soon in-creased his dis-tance while the Pe-quod slid in be-tween him and Stub-b s whale Where-upon Stubb quick-ly pulled to the float-ing body and hail-ing the Pe-quod to give no-tice of his in-ten-tions at on-ce pro-ceed-ed to reap the fruit of his un-righ-teous cun-ning Seiz-ing his sharp boat spade he com-menced an ex-ca-va-tion in the body a lit-tle be-hind the side fin You would al-most have thought he was dig-ging a cel-lar there in the sea and when at length his spade struck again-st the gaunt ribs it was like turn-ing up old Ro-man tiles and pot-tery buried in fat English loam His boat s crew were all in high ex-cite-ment ea-ger-ly help-ing their chief and look-ing as anx-ious as gold hunters And all the time num-ber-less fowls were div-ing and duck-ing and scream-ing and yelling and fight-ing around them Stubb was be-gin-ning to look dis-ap-point-ed es-pe-cial-ly as the hor-ri-ble nosegay in-creased when sud-den-ly from out the very heart of this plague there stole a faint stream of per-fume which flowed through the tide of bad smells with-out be-ing ab-sorbed by it as one river will flow in-to and then along with an-oth-er with-out at all blend-ing with it for a time  I have it I have it  cried Stubb with de-light strik-ing some-thing in the sub-ter-ranean re-gions  a purse a purse  Drop-ping his spade he thrust both hands in and drew out hand-fuls of some-thing that looked like ripe Wind-sor soap or rich mot-tled old cheese very unc-tu-ous and sa-vory with-al You might eas-i-ly dent it with your thumb it is of a hue be-tween yel-low and ash colour And this good friends is am-ber-gris worth a gold guinea an ounce to any drug-gist Some six hand-fuls were ob-tained but more was un-avoid-ably lost in the sea and still more per-haps might have been se-cured were it not for im-pa-tient Ahab s loud com-mand to Stubb to de-sist and come on board else the ship would bid them good bye CHAPTER 92 Am-ber-gris Now this am-ber-gris is a very cu-ri-ous sub-stance and so im-por-tant as an ar-ti-cle of com-merce that in 1791 a cer-tain Nan-tuck-et born Cap-tain Coffin was ex-am-ined at the bar of the English House of Com-mons on that sub-ject For at that time and in-deed un-til a com-par-a-tive-ly late day the pre-cise orig-in of am-ber-gris re-mained like am-ber it-self a prob-lem to the learned Though the word am-ber-gris is but the French com-pound for grey am-ber yet the two sub-stances are quite dis-tinct For am-ber though at times found on the sea coast is al-so dug up in some far in-land soils where-as am-ber-gris is nev-er found ex-cept up-on the sea Be-sides am-ber is a hard trans-par-ent brit-tle odor-less sub-stance used for mouth pieces to pipes for beads and or-na-men-ts but am-ber-gris is soft waxy and so high-ly fra-grant and spicy that it is large-ly used in per-fumery in pastiles pre-cious can-dles hair pow-ders and po-ma-tum The Turks use it in cook-ing and al-so car-ry it to Mec-ca for the same pur-pose that frank-in-cense is car-ried to St Peter s in Rome Some wine mer-chan-ts drop a few grains in-to claret to fla-vor it Who would think then that such fine ladies and gen-tle-men should re-gale them-selves with an essence found in the in-glo-ri-ous bow-els of a sick whale Yet so it is By some am-ber-gris is sup-posed to be the cause and by oth-ers the ef-fect of the dys-pep-sia in the whale How to cure such a dys-pep-sia it were hard to say un-less by ad-min-is-ter-ing three or four boat loads of Bran-dreth s pil-ls and then run-ning out of har-m s way as la-bor-ers do in blast-ing rocks I have for-got-ten to say that there were found in this am-ber-gris cer-tain hard round bony plates which at first Stubb thought might be sailors trowsers but-tons but it af-ter-wards turned out that they were noth-ing more than pieces of small squid bones em-balmed in that man-ner Now that the in-cor-rup-tion of this most fra-grant am-ber-gris should be found in the heart of such de-cay is this noth-ing Be-think thee of that say-ing of St Paul in Corinthi-ans about cor-rup-tion and in-cor-rup-tion how that we are sown in dis-hon-or but raised in glo-ry And like-wise call to mind that say-ing of Paracel-sus about what it is that maketh the best musk Al-so for-get not the strange fact that of all things of ill sa-vor Cologne wa-ter in its rudi-men-tal man-u-fac-tur-ing stages is the worst I should like to con-clude the chap-ter with the above ap-peal but can-not ow-ing to my anx-i-ety to re-pel a charge of-ten made again-st whale-men and which in the es-ti-ma-tion of some al-ready bi-ased minds might be con-sid-ered as in-di-rect-ly sub-stan-ti-at-ed by what has been said of the French-man s two whales Else-where in this vol-ume the slan-der-ous as-per-sion has been dis-proved that the vo-ca-tion of whal-ing is through-out a slat-tern-ly un-tidy busi-ness But there is an-oth-er thing to re-but They hint that all whales al-ways smell bad Now how did this odi-ous stig-ma orig-i-nate I opine that it is plain-ly trace-able to the first ar-rival of the Green-land whal-ing ships in Lon-don more than two cen-turies ago Be-cause those whale-men did not then and do not now try out their oil at sea as the South-ern ships have al-ways done but cut-ting up the fresh blub-ber in small bits thrust it through the bung holes of large casks and car-ry it home in that man-ner the short-ness of the sea-son in those Icy Seas and the sud-den and vi-o-lent stor-ms to which they are ex-posed for-bid-ding any oth-er course The con-se-quence is that up-on break-ing in-to the hold and un-load-ing one of the-se whale ceme-ter-ies in the Green-land dock a sa-vor is given forth some-what sim-i-lar to that aris-ing from ex-ca-vat-ing an old city grave yard for the foun-da-tions of a Ly-ing in Hospi-tal I part-ly sur-mise al-so that this wicked charge again-st whalers may be like-wise im-put-ed to the ex-is-tence on the coast of Green-land in for-mer times of a Dutch vil-lage called Sch-meren-burgh or Smeeren-berg which lat-ter name is the one used by the learned Fo-go Von Slack in his great work on Smel-ls a text book on that sub-ject As its name im-ports smeer fat berg to put up this vil-lage was found-ed in or-der to af-ford a place for the blub-ber of the Dutch whale fleet to be tried out with-out be-ing tak-en home to Hol-land for that pur-pose It was a col-lec-tion of fur-naces fat ket-tles and oil sheds and when the works were in full op-er-a-tion cer-tain-ly gave forth no very pleas-ant sa-vor But all this is quite dif-fer-ent with a South Sea Sperm Whaler which in a voy-age of four years per-haps af-ter com-plete-ly fill-ing her hold with oil does not per-haps con-sume fifty days in the busi-ness of boil-ing out and in the state that it is casked the oil is near-ly scent-less The truth is that liv-ing or dead if but de-cent-ly treat-ed whales as a species are by no means crea-tures of ill odor nor can whale-men be recog-nised as the peo-ple of the mid-dle ages af-fect-ed to de-tect a Jew in the com-pa-ny by the nose Nor in-deed can the whale pos-si-bly be oth-er-wise than fra-grant when as a gen-er-al thing he en-joys such high health tak-ing abun-dance of ex-er-cise al-ways out of doors though it is true sel-dom in the open air I say that the mo-tion of a Sperm Whale s flukes above wa-ter dis-pens-es a per-fume as when a musk scent-ed la-dy rustles her dress in a warm par-lor What then shall I liken the Sperm Whale to for fra-grance con-sid-er-ing his mag-ni-tude Must it not be to that fa-mous ele-phant with jew-elled tusks and redo-lent with myrrh which was led out of an In-di-an town to do hon-or to Alexan-der the Great CHAPTER 93 The Cast-away It was but some few days af-ter en-coun-ter-ing the French-man that a most sig-nif-i-cant event be-fell the most in-signif-i-cant of the Pe-quod s crew an event most lamentable and which end-ed in pro-vid-ing the some-times mad-ly mer-ry and pre-des-ti-nat-ed craft with a liv-ing and ev-er ac-com-pa-ny-ing prophe-cy of what-ev-er shat-tered se-quel might prove her own Now in the whale ship it is not ev-ery one that goes in the boats Some few hands are re-served called ship keep-ers whose province it is to work the ves-sel while the boats are pur-su-ing the whale As a gen-er-al thing the-se ship keep-ers are as hardy fel-lows as the men com-pris-ing the boat-s crews But if there hap-pen to be an un-du-ly slen-der clum-sy or tim-o-rous wight in the ship that wight is cer-tain to be made a ship keep-er It was so in the Pe-quod with the lit-tle ne-gro Pip-pin by nick name Pip by ab-bre-vi-a-tion Poor Pip ye have heard of him be-fore ye must re-mem-ber his tam-bourine on that dra-mat-ic mid-night so gloomy jol-ly In out-er as-pect Pip and Dough Boy made a match like a black pony and a white one of equal de-vel-op-men-ts though of dis-sim-i-lar colour driven in one ec-cen-tric span But while hap-less Dough Boy was by na-ture dull and tor-pid in his in-tel-lec-ts Pip though over ten-der heart-ed was at bot-tom very bright with that pleas-ant ge-nial jol-ly bright-ness pe-cu-liar to his tribe a tribe which ev-er en-joy all hol-i-days and fes-tiv-i-ties with fin-er freer rel-ish than any oth-er race For blacks the year s cal-en-dar should show naught but three hun-dred and six-ty five Fourth of Ju-lys and New Year s Days Nor smile so while I write that this lit-tle black was bril-liant for even black-ness has its bril-lian-cy be-hold yon lus-trous ebony pan-elled in king s cab-i-nets But Pip loved life and all life s peace-able se-cu-ri-ties so that the pan-ic strik-ing busi-ness in which he had some-how un-ac-count-ably be-come en-trapped had most sad-ly blurred his bright-ness though as ere long will be seen what was thus tem-porar-i-ly sub-dued in him in the end was des-tined to be lurid-ly il-lu-mined by strange wild fires that fic-ti-tious-ly showed him off to ten times the nat-u-ral lus-tre with which in his na-tive Tol-land Coun-ty in Con-necti-cut he had on-ce en-livened many a fid-dler s frol-ic on the green and at melo-di-ous even tide with his gay ha ha had turned the round hori-zon in-to one star belled tam-bourine So though in the clear air of day sus-pend-ed again-st a blue veined neck the pure wa-tered di-a-mond drop will health-ful glow yet when the cun-ning jew-eller would show you the di-a-mond in its most im-pres-sive lus-tre he lays it again-st a gloomy ground and then lights it up not by the sun but by some un-nat-u-ral gas-es Then come out those fiery ef-ful-gences in-fer-nal-ly su-perb then the evil blaz-ing di-a-mond on-ce the di-vinest sym-bol of the crys-tal skies looks like some crown jew-el stolen from the King of Hell But let us to the sto-ry It came to pass that in the am-ber-gris af-fair Stub-b s af-ter oars-man chanced so to sprain his hand as for a time to be-come quite maimed and tem-porar-i-ly Pip was put in-to his place The first time Stubb low-ered with him Pip evinced much ner-vous-ness but hap-pi-ly for that time es-caped close con-tact with the whale and there-fore came off not al-to-geth-er dis-cred-itably though Stubb ob-serv-ing him took care af-ter-wards to ex-hort him to cher-ish his coura-geous-ness to the ut-most for he might of-ten find it need-ful Now up-on the sec-ond low-er-ing the boat pad-dled up-on the whale and as the fish re-ceived the dart-ed iron it gave its cus-tom-ary rap which hap-pened in this in-stance to be right un-der poor Pip s seat The in-vol-un-tary con-ster-na-tion of the mo-ment caused him to leap pad-dle in hand out of the boat and in such a way that part of the slack whale line com-ing again-st his chest he breast-ed it over-board with him so as to be-come en-tan-gled in it when at last plump-ing in-to the wa-ter That in-stant the strick-en whale start-ed on a fierce run the line swift-ly straight-ened and presto poor Pip came all foam-ing up to the chocks of the boat re-morse-less-ly dragged there by the line which had tak-en sev-er-al turns around his chest and neck Tashte-go stood in the bows He was full of the fire of the hunt He hat-ed Pip for a poltroon Snatch-ing the boat knife from its sheath he sus-pend-ed its sharp edge over the line and turn-ing to-wards Stubb ex-claimed in-ter-rog-a-tive-ly  Cut  Mean-time Pip s blue choked face plain-ly looked Do for God s sake All passed in a flash In less than half a min-ute this en-tire thing hap-pened  Damn him cut  roared Stubb and so the whale was lost and Pip was saved So soon as he re-cov-ered him-self the poor lit-tle ne-gro was as-sailed by yel-ls and ex-e-cra-tions from the crew Tran-quil-ly per-mit-ting the-se ir-reg-u-lar curs-ings to evap-o-rate Stubb then in a plain busi-ness like but still half hu-mor-ous man-ner cursed Pip of-fi-cial-ly and that done un-of-fi-cial-ly gave him much whole-some ad-vice The sub-stance was Nev-er jump from a boat Pip ex-cep-t but all the rest was in-def-i-nite as the soundest ad-vice ev-er is Now in gen-er-al Stick to the boat is your true mot-to in whal-ing but cas-es will some-times hap-pen when Leap from the boat is still bet-ter More-over as if per-ceiv-ing at last that if he should give undi-lut-ed con-sci-en-tious ad-vice to Pip he would be leav-ing him too wide a margin to jump in for the fu-ture Stubb sud-den-ly dropped all ad-vice and con-clud-ed with a peremp-to-ry com-mand  Stick to the boat Pip or by the Lord I won t pick you up if you jump mind that We can t af-ford to lose whales by the likes of you a whale would sell for thir-ty times what you would Pip in Alaba-ma Bear that in mind and don t jump any more  Here-by per-haps Stubb in-di-rect-ly hint-ed that though man loved his fel-low yet man is a mon-ey mak-ing an-i-mal which propen-si-ty too of-ten in-ter-fer-es with his benev-o-lence But we are all in the hands of the Gods and Pip jumped again It was un-der very sim-i-lar cir-cum-stances to the first per-for-mance but this time he did not breast out the line and hence when the whale start-ed to run Pip was left be-hind on the sea like a hur-ried trav-eller s trunk Alas Stubb was but too true to his word It was a beau-ti-ful boun-teous blue day the span-gled sea calm and cool and flat-ly stretch-ing away all round to the hori-zon like gold beat-er s skin ham-mered out to the ex-tremest Bob-bing up and down in that sea Pip s ebon head showed like a head of cloves No boat knife was lift-ed when he fell so rapid-ly astern Stub-b s in-ex-orable back was turned up-on him and the whale was winged In three min-utes a whole mile of shore-less ocean was be-tween Pip and Stubb Out from the cen-tre of the sea poor Pip turned his crisp curling black head to the sun an-oth-er lone-ly cast-away though the lofti-est and the bright-est Now in calm weath-er to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the prac-tised swim-mer as to ride in a spring car-riage ashore But the aw-ful lone-some-ness is in-tol-er-a-ble The in-tense con-cen-tra-tion of self in the mid-dle of such a heart-less im-men-si-ty my God who can tell it Mark how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea mark how close-ly they hug their ship and on-ly coast along her sides But had Stubb re-al-ly aban-doned the poor lit-tle ne-gro to his fate No he did not mean to at least Be-cause there were two boats in his wake and he sup-posed no doubt that they would of course come up to Pip very quick-ly and pick him up though in-deed such con-sid-er-a-tions to-wards oars-men jeop-ar-dized through their own timid-i-ty is not al-ways man-i-fest-ed by the hunters in all sim-i-lar in-stances and such in-stances not un-fre-quent-ly oc-cur al-most in-vari-ably in the fish-ery a cow-ard so called is marked with the same ruth-less de-tes-ta-tion pe-cu-liar to mil-i-tary navies and armies But it so hap-pened that those boats with-out see-ing Pip sud-den-ly spy-ing whales close to them on one side turned and gave chase and Stub-b s boat was now so far away and he and all his crew so in-tent up-on his fish that Pip s ringed hori-zon be-gan to ex-pand around him mis-er-ably By the mer-est chance the ship it-self at last res-cued him but from that hour the lit-tle ne-gro went about the deck an id-iot such at least they said he was The sea had jeer-ing-ly kept his finite body up but drowned the in-finite of his soul Not drowned en-tire-ly though Rather car-ried down alive to won-drous depths where strange shapes of the un-warped pri-mal world glid-ed to and fro be-fore his pas-sive eyes and the mis-er mer-man Wis-dom re-vealed his hoard-ed heaps and among the joy-ous heart-less ev-er ju-ve-nile eter-ni-ties Pip saw the mul-ti-tudi-nous God om-nipresent coral in-sec-ts that out of the fir-ma-ment of wa-ters heaved the colos-sal or-bs He saw God s foot up-on the treadle of the loom and spoke it and there-fore his ship-mates called him mad So man s in-san-i-ty is heav-en s sense and wan-der-ing from all mor-tal rea-son man comes at last to that ce-les-tial thought which to rea-son is ab-surd and fran-tic and weal or woe feels then un-com-pro-mised in-dif-fer-ent as his God For the rest blame not Stubb too hard-ly The thing is com-mon in that fish-ery and in the se-quel of the nar-ra-tive it will then be seen what like aban-don-ment be-fell my-self CHAPTER 94 A Squeeze of the Hand That whale of Stub-b s so dear-ly pur-chased was du-ly brought to the Pe-quod s side where all those cut-ting and hoist-ing op-er-a-tions pre-vi-ous-ly de-tailed were reg-u-lar-ly gone through even to the bal-ing of the Hei-del-burgh Tun or Case While some were oc-cu-pied with this lat-ter du-ty oth-ers were em-ployed in drag-ging away the larg-er tubs so soon as filled with the sperm and when the prop-er time ar-rived this same sperm was care-ful-ly ma-nip-u-lat-ed ere go-ing to the try works of which anon It had cooled and crys-tal-lized to such a de-gree that when with sev-er-al oth-ers I sat down be-fore a large Con-stan-tine s bath of it I found it strange-ly con-cret-ed in-to lumps here and there rolling about in the liq-uid part It was our busi-ness to squeeze the-se lumps back in-to flu-id A sweet and unc-tu-ous du-ty No won-der that in old times this sperm was such a favourite cos-met-ic Such a clearer such a sweet-en-er such a soft-en-er such a de-li-cious mo-lifier After hav-ing my hands in it for on-ly a few min-utes my fin-gers felt like eels and be-gan as it were to ser-pen-tine and spi-ralise As I sat there at my ease cross legged on the deck af-ter the bit-ter ex-er-tion at the wind-lass un-der a blue tran-quil sky the ship un-der in-do-lent sail and glid-ing so serene-ly along as I bathed my hands among those soft gen-tle glob-ules of in-fil-trat-ed tis-sues wo-ven al-most with-in the hour as they rich-ly broke to my fin-gers and dis-charged all their op-u-lence like ful-ly ripe grapes their wine as I snuffed up that un-con-tam-i-nat-ed aro-ma  lit-er-al-ly and tru-ly like the smell of spring vi-o-lets I de-clare to you that for the time I lived as in a musky mead-ow I for-got all about our hor-ri-ble oath in that in-ex-press-ible sperm I washed my hands and my heart of it I al-most be-gan to cred-it the old Paracel-san su-per-sti-tion that sperm is of rare virtue in al-lay-ing the heat of anger while bathing in that bath I felt di-vine-ly free from all ill will or petu-lance or mal-ice of any sort what-so-ev-er Squeeze squeeze squeeze all the morn-ing long I squeezed that sperm till I my-self al-most melt-ed in-to it I squeezed that sperm till a strange sort of in-san-i-ty came over me and I found my-self un-wit-ting-ly squeez-ing my co la-bor-ers hands in it mis-tak-ing their hands for the gen-tle glob-ules Such an abound-ing af-fec-tion-ate friend-ly lov-ing feel-ing did this av-o-ca-tion beget that at last I was con-tin-u-al-ly squeez-ing their hands and look-ing up in-to their eyes sen-ti-men-tal-ly as much as to say  Oh my dear fel-low be-ings why should we longer cher-ish any so-cial acer-bities or know the slight-est ill hu-mor or en-vy Come let us squeeze hands all round nay let us all squeeze our-selves in-to each oth-er let us squeeze our-selves uni-ver-sal-ly in-to the very milk and sperm of kind-ness Would that I could keep squeez-ing that sperm for ev-er For now since by many pro-longed re-peat-ed ex-pe-ri-ences I have per-ceived that in all cas-es man must even-tu-al-ly low-er or at least shift his con-ceit of at-tain-able fe-lic-i-ty not plac-ing it any-where in the in-tel-lect or the fan-cy but in the wife the heart the bed the table the sad-dle the fireside the coun-try now that I have per-ceived all this I am ready to squeeze case eter-nal-ly In thoughts of the vi-sions of the night I saw long rows of an-gels in par-adise each with his hands in a jar of sper-ma-ceti Now while dis-cours-ing of sperm it be-hooves to speak of oth-er things ak-in to it in the busi-ness of prepar-ing the sperm whale for the try works First comes white horse so called which is ob-tained from the ta-per-ing part of the fish and al-so from the thick-er por-tions of his flukes It is tough with con-gealed ten-don-s a wad of mus-cle but still con-tains some oil After be-ing sev-ered from the whale the white horse is first cut in-to portable ob-longs ere go-ing to the min-cer They look much like blocks of Berk-shire mar-ble Plum pud-ding is the term be-stowed up-on cer-tain frag-men-tary parts of the whale s flesh here and there ad-her-ing to the blan-ket of blub-ber and of-ten par-tic-i-pat-ing to a con-sid-er-able de-gree in its unc-tu-ous-ness It is a most re-fresh-ing con-vivial beau-ti-ful ob-ject to be-hold As its name im-ports it is of an ex-ceed-ing-ly rich mot-tled tint with a be-streaked snowy and gold-en ground dot-ted with spots of the deep-est crim-son and pur-ple It is plums of ru-bies in pic-tures of cit-ron Spite of rea-son it is hard to keep your-self from eat-ing it I con-fess that on-ce I stole be-hind the fore-mast to try it It tast-ed some-thing as I should con-ceive a roy-al cut-let from the thigh of Louis le Gros might have tast-ed sup-pos-ing him to have been killed the first day af-ter the venison sea-son and that par-tic-u-lar venison sea-son con-tem-po-rary with an un-usu-al-ly fine vin-tage of the vine-yards of Cham-pag-ne There is an-oth-er sub-stance and a very sin-gu-lar one which turns up in the course of this busi-ness but which I feel it to be very puz-zling ad-e-quate-ly to de-scribe It is called slob-gol-lion an ap-pel-la-tion orig-i-nal with the whale-men and even so is the na-ture of the sub-stance It is an in-ef-fa-bly oozy stringy af-fair most fre-quent-ly found in the tubs of sperm af-ter a pro-longed squeez-ing and sub-se-quent de-cant-ing I hold it to be the won-drous-ly thin rup-tured mem-branes of the case co-a-lesc-ing Gur-ry so called is a term prop-er-ly be-long-ing to right whale-men but some-times in-ci-den-tal-ly used by the sperm fish-er-men It des-ig-nates the dark gluti-nous sub-stance which is scraped off the back of the Green-land or right whale and much of which cov-ers the decks of those in-fe-ri-or souls who hunt that ig-no-ble Le-viathan Nip-pers Strict-ly this word is not in-dige-nous to the whale s vo-cab-u-lary But as ap-plied by whale-men it be-comes so A whale-man s nip-per is a short firm strip of tendi-nous stuff cut from the ta-per-ing part of Le-viathan s tail it av-er-ages an inch in thick-ness and for the rest is about the size of the iron part of a hoe Edge-wise moved along the oily deck it op-er-ates like a leath-ern squil-gee and by name-less blan-dish-men-ts as of mag-ic al-lures along with it all im-pu-ri-ties But to learn all about the-se re-con-dite mat-ters your best way is at on-ce to de-scend in-to the blub-ber room and have a long talk with its in-mates This place has pre-vi-ous-ly been men-tioned as the re-cep-ta-cle for the blan-ket pieces when stript and hoist-ed from the whale When the prop-er time ar-rives for cut-ting up its con-tents this apart-ment is a scene of ter-ror to all ty-ros es-pe-cial-ly by night On one side lit by a dull lantern a space has been left clear for the work-men They gen-er-al-ly go in pairs  a pike and gaffman and a spade man The whal-ing pike is sim-i-lar to a frigate s board-ing weapon of the same name The gaff is some-thing like a boat hook With his gaff the gaffman hooks on to a sheet of blub-ber and strives to hold it from slip-ping as the ship pitch-es and lurch-es about Mean-while the spade man stands on the sheet it-self per-pen-dic-u-lar-ly chop-ping it in-to the portable horse pieces This spade is sharp as hone can make it the spade-man s feet are shoe-less the thing he stands on will some-times ir-re-sistibly slide away from him like a sledge If he cuts off one of his own toes or one of his as-sis-tants would you be very much as-ton-ished Toes are scarce among vet-er-an blub-ber room men CHAPTER 95 The Cas-sock Had you stepped on board the Pe-quod at a cer-tain junc-ture of this post mortem-iz-ing of the whale and had you strolled for-ward nigh the wind-lass pret-ty sure am I that you would have scanned with no small cu-rios-i-ty a very strange enig-mat-i-cal ob-ject which you would have seen there ly-ing along length-wise in the lee scup-pers Not the won-drous cis-tern in the whale s huge head not the prodi-gy of his un-hinged low-er jaw not the mir-a-cle of his sym-met-ri-cal tail none of the-se would so sur-prise you as half a glimpse of that un-ac-count-able cone  longer than a Ken-tuck-ian is tall nigh a foot in di-am-e-ter at the base and jet black as Yo-jo the ebony idol of Quee-queg And an idol in-deed it is or rather in old times its like-ness was Such an idol as that found in the se-cret groves of Queen Maachah in Judea and for wor-ship-ping which King Asa her son did de-pose her and de-stroyed the idol and burnt it for an abom-i-na-tion at the brook Ke-dron as dark-ly set forth in the 15th chap-ter of the First Book of Kings Look at the sailor called the min-cer who now comes along and as-sist-ed by two al-lies heav-i-ly backs the gran-dis-simus as the mariners call it and with bowed shoul-ders stag-gers off with it as if he were a grenadier car-ry-ing a dead com-rade from the field Ex-tend-ing it up-on the fore-castle deck he now pro-ceeds cylin-dri-cal-ly to re-move its dark pelt as an African hunter the pelt of a boa This done he turns the pelt in-side out like a pan-taloon leg gives it a good stretch-ing so as al-most to dou-ble its di-am-e-ter and at last hangs it well spread in the rig-ging to dry Ere long it is tak-en down when re-mov-ing some three feet of it to-wards the point-ed ex-trem-i-ty and then cut-ting two slits for arm holes at the oth-er end he length-wise slips him-self bod-i-ly in-to it The min-cer now stands be-fore you in-vest-ed in the full canon-i-cals of his call-ing Im-memo-ri-al to all his or-der this in-vesti-ture alone will ad-e-quate-ly pro-tect him while em-ployed in the pe-cu-liar func-tions of his of-fice That of-fice con-sists in minc-ing the horse pieces of blub-ber for the pots an op-er-a-tion which is con-duct-ed at a cu-ri-ous wood-en horse plant-ed end-wise again-st the bul-warks and with a ca-pa-cious tub be-neath it in-to which the minced pieces drop fast as the sheets from a rapt or-a-tor s desk Ar-rayed in de-cent black oc-cu-py-ing a con-spic-u-ous pul-pit in-tent on bible leaves what a can-di-date for an arch-bish-opric what a lad for a Pope were this min-cer Bi-ble leaves Bi-ble leaves This is the in-vari-able cry from the mates to the min-cer It en-joins him to be care-ful and cut his work in-to as thin slices as pos-si-ble inas-much as by so do-ing the busi-ness of boil-ing out the oil is much ac-cel-er-at-ed and its quan-ti-ty con-sid-er-ably in-creased be-sides per-haps im-prov-ing it in qual-i-ty CHAPTER 96 The Try Works Be-sides her hoist-ed boats an Amer-i-can whaler is out-ward-ly dis-tin-guished by her try works She pre-sen-ts the cu-ri-ous anoma-ly of the most solid ma-son-ry join-ing with oak and hemp in con-sti-tut-ing the com-plet-ed ship It is as if from the open field a brick kiln were trans-port-ed to her planks The try works are plant-ed be-tween the fore-mast and main-mast the most roomy part of the deck The tim-bers be-neath are of a pe-cu-liar strength fit-ted to sus-tain the weight of an al-most solid mass of brick and mor-tar some ten feet by eight square and five in height The foun-da-tion does not pen-e-trate the deck but the ma-son-ry is firm-ly se-cured to the sur-face by pon-der-ous knees of iron brac-ing it on all sides and screw-ing it down to the tim-bers On the flanks it is cased with wood and at top com-plete-ly cov-ered by a large slop-ing bat-tened hatch-way Re-mov-ing this hatch we ex-pose the great try pots two in num-ber and each of sev-er-al bar-rel-s ca-pac-i-ty When not in use they are kept re-mark-ably clean Some-times they are pol-ished with soap-stone and sand till they shine with-in like sil-ver punch bowls Dur-ing the night watch-es some cyn-i-cal old sailors will crawl in-to them and coil them-selves away there for a nap While em-ployed in pol-ish-ing them one man in each pot side by side many con-fi-den-tial com-mu-ni-ca-tions are car-ried on over the iron lips It is a place al-so for pro-found math-e-mat-i-cal med-i-ta-tion It was in the left hand try pot of the Pe-quod with the soap-stone dili-gent-ly cir-cling round me that I was first in-di-rect-ly struck by the re-mark-able fact that in ge-om-e-try all bod-ies glid-ing along the cy-cloid my soap-stone for ex-am-ple will de-scend from any point in pre-cise-ly the same time Re-mov-ing the fire board from the front of the try works the bare ma-son-ry of that side is ex-posed pen-e-trat-ed by the two iron mouths of the fur-naces di-rect-ly un-der-neath the pots Th-e-se mouths are fit-ted with heavy doors of iron The in-tense heat of the fire is pre-vent-ed from com-mu-ni-cat-ing it-self to the deck by means of a shal-low reser-voir ex-tend-ing un-der the en-tire in-closed sur-face of the works By a tun-nel in-sert-ed at the rear this reser-voir is kept re-plen-ished with wa-ter as fast as it evap-o-rates There are no ex-ter-nal chim-neys they open di-rect from the rear wall And here let us go back for a mo-ment It was about nine o clock at night that the Pe-quod s try works were first start-ed on this pre-sent voy-age It be-longed to Stubb to over-see the busi-ness  All ready there Off hatch then and start her You cook fire the works  This was an easy thing for the car-pen-ter had been thrust-ing his shav-ings in-to the fur-nace through-out the pas-sage Here be it said that in a whal-ing voy-age the first fire in the try works has to be fed for a time with wood After that no wood is used ex-cept as a means of quick ig-ni-tion to the sta-ple fu-el In a word af-ter be-ing tried out the crisp shriv-elled blub-ber now called scraps or frit-ters still con-tains con-sid-er-able of its unc-tu-ous prop-er-ties Th-e-se frit-ters feed the flames Like a plethoric burn-ing mar-tyr or a self con-sum-ing mis-an-thrope on-ce ig-nit-ed the whale sup-plies his own fu-el and burns by his own body Would that he con-sumed his own smoke for his smoke is hor-ri-ble to in-hale and in-hale it you must and not on-ly that but you must live in it for the time It has an un-speak-able wild Hin-doo odor about it such as may lurk in the vicin-i-ty of fu-ne-re-al pyres It smells like the left wing of the day of judg-ment it is an ar-gu-ment for the pit By mid-night the works were in full op-er-a-tion We were clear from the car-case sail had been made the wind was fresh-en-ing the wild ocean dark-ness was in-tense But that dark-ness was licked up by the fierce flames which at in-ter-vals forked forth from the sooty flues and il-lu-mi-nat-ed ev-ery lofty rope in the rig-ging as with the famed Greek fire The burn-ing ship drove on as if re-morse-less-ly com-mis-sioned to some venge-ful deed So the pitch and sul-phur freight-ed brigs of the bold Hy-dri-ote Ca-naris is-su-ing from their mid-night har-bors with broad sheets of flame for sails bore down up-on the Turk-ish frigates and fold-ed them in con-fla-gra-tions The hatch re-moved from the top of the works now af-ford-ed a wide hearth in front of them Stand-ing on this were the Tartare-an shapes of the pa-gan har-pooneers al-ways the whale ship s stok-ers With huge pronged poles they pitched hiss-ing mass-es of blub-ber in-to the scald-ing pots or stirred up the fires be-neath till the snaky flames dart-ed curling out of the doors to catch them by the feet The smoke rolled away in sul-len heaps To ev-ery pitch of the ship there was a pitch of the boil-ing oil which seemed all ea-ger-ness to leap in-to their faces Op-po-site the mouth of the works on the fur-ther side of the wide wood-en hearth was the wind-lass This served for a sea so-fa Here lounged the watch when not oth-er-wise em-ployed look-ing in-to the red heat of the fire till their eyes felt scorched in their heads Their tawny fea-tures now all be-grimed with smoke and sweat their mat-ted beards and the con-trast-ing bar-bar-ic bril-lian-cy of their teeth all the-se were strange-ly re-vealed in the capri-cious em-bla-zon-ings of the works As they nar-rat-ed to each oth-er their un-holy ad-ven-tures their tales of ter-ror told in words of mirth as their un-civ-i-lized laugh-ter forked up-wards out of them like the flames from the fur-nace as to and fro in their front the har-pooneers wild-ly ges-tic-u-lat-ed with their huge pronged forks and dip-pers as the wind howled on and the sea leaped and the ship groaned and dived and yet stead-fast-ly shot her red hell fur-ther and fur-ther in-to the black-ness of the sea and the night and scorn-ful-ly champed the white bone in her mouth and vi-cious-ly spat round her on all sides then the rush-ing Pe-quod freight-ed with sav-ages and laden with fire and burn-ing a corpse and plung-ing in-to that black-ness of dark-ness seemed the ma-te-ri-al coun-ter-part of her mono-ma-ni-ac com-man-der s soul So seemed it to me as I stood at her helm and for long hours silent-ly guid-ed the way of this fire ship on the sea Wrapped for that in-ter-val in dark-ness my-self I but the bet-ter saw the red-ness the mad-ness the ghast-li-ness of oth-ers The con-tin-u-al sight of the fiend shapes be-fore me ca-per-ing half in smoke and half in fire the-se at last be-gat kin-dred vi-sions in my soul so soon as I be-gan to yield to that un-ac-count-able drowsi-ness which ev-er would come over me at a mid-night helm But that night in par-tic-u-lar a strange and ev-er since in-ex-pli-ca-ble thing oc-curred to me Start-ing from a brief stand-ing sleep I was hor-ri-bly con-scious of some-thing fa-tal-ly wrong The jaw bone tiller smote my side which leaned again-st it in my ears was the low hum of sails just be-gin-ning to shake in the wind I thought my eyes were open I was half con-scious of putting my fin-gers to the lids and me-chan-i-cal-ly stretch-ing them still fur-ther apart But spite of all this I could see no com-pass be-fore me to steer by though it seemed but a min-ute since I had been watch-ing the card by the steady bin-na-cle lamp il-lu-mi-nat-ing it Noth-ing seemed be-fore me but a jet gloom now and then made ghast-ly by flash-es of red-ness Up-per-most was the im-pres-sion that what-ev-er swift rush-ing thing I stood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as rush-ing from all havens astern A stark be-wil-dered feel-ing as of death came over me Con-vul-sive-ly my hands grasped the tiller but with the crazy con-ceit that the tiller was some-how in some en-chant-ed way in-vert-ed My God what is the mat-ter with me thought I Lo in my brief sleep I had turned my-self about and was fronting the ship s stern with my back to her prow and the com-pass In an in-stant I faced back just in time to pre-vent the ves-sel from fly-ing up in-to the wind and very prob-a-bly cap-siz-ing her How glad and how grate-ful the re-lief from this un-nat-u-ral hal-lu-ci-na-tion of the night and the fa-tal con-tin-gen-cy of be-ing brought by the lee Look not too long in the face of the fire O man Nev-er dream with thy hand on the helm Turn not thy back to the com-pass ac-cept the first hint of the hitch-ing tiller be-lieve not the ar-ti-fi-cial fire when its red-ness makes all things look ghast-ly To mor-row in the nat-u-ral sun the skies will be bright those who glared like dev-ils in the fork-ing flames the morn will show in far oth-er at least gen-tler re-lief the glo-ri-ous gold-en glad sun the on-ly true lam-p all oth-ers but liars Nev-er-the-less the sun hides not Vir-gini-a s Dis-mal Swamp nor Rome s ac-cursed Cam-pag-na nor wide Sa-hara nor all the mil-lions of miles of deserts and of griefs be-neath the moon The sun hides not the ocean which is the dark side of this earth and which is two thirds of this earth So there-fore that mor-tal man who hath more of joy than sor-row in him that mor-tal man can-not be true not true or un-de-vel-oped With books the same The truest of all men was the Man of Sor-rows and the truest of all books is Solomon s and Ec-cle-si-astes is the fine ham-mered steel of woe  All is van-i-ty  ALL This wil-ful world hath not got hold of unchris-tian Solomon s wis-dom yet But he who dodges hos-pi-tals and jails and walks fast cross-ing grave-yards and would rather talk of op-eras than hell cal-ls Cow-per Young Pas-cal Rousseau poor dev-ils all of sick men and through-out a care free life-time swears by Ra-belais as pass-ing wise and there-fore jol-ly  not that man is fit-ted to sit down on tomb stones and break the green damp mould with un-fath-omably won-drous Solomon But even Solomon he says  the man that wan-dereth out of the way of un-der-stand-ing shall re-main i e even while liv-ing  in the con-gre-ga-tion of the dead  Give not thy-self up then to fire lest it in-vert thee dead-en thee as for the time it did me There is a wis-dom that is woe but there is a woe that is mad-ness And there is a Catskill ea-gle in some souls that can alike di-ve down in-to the black-est gorges and soar out of them again and be-come in-vis-i-ble in the sun-ny spaces And even if he for ev-er flies with-in the gorge that gorge is in the moun-tains so that even in his low-est swoop the moun-tain ea-gle is still high-er than oth-er birds up-on the plain even though they soar CHAPTER 97 The Lamp Had you de-scend-ed from the Pe-quod s try works to the Pe-quod s fore-castle where the off du-ty watch were sleep-ing for one sin-gle mo-ment you would have al-most thought you were stand-ing in some il-lu-mi-nat-ed shrine of can-on-ized kings and coun-sel-lors There they lay in their tri-an-gu-lar oak-en vaults each mariner a chis-elled mute-ness a score of lam-ps flash-ing up-on his hood-ed eyes In mer-chant-men oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk of queens To dress in the dark and eat in the dark and stum-ble in dark-ness to his pal-let this is his usu-al lot But the whale-man as he seeks the food of light so he lives in light He makes his berth an Aladdin s lamp and lays him down in it so that in the pitchi-est night the ship s black hull still hous-es an il-lu-mi-na-tion See with what en-tire free-dom the whale-man takes his hand-ful of lamp-s of-ten but old bot-tles and vials though to the cop-per cool-er at the try works and re-plen-ish-es them there as mugs of ale at a vat He burns too the purest of oil in its un-man-u-fac-tured and there-fore unvi-ti-at-ed state a flu-id un-known to so-lar lu-nar or as-tral con-trivances ashore It is sweet as ear-ly grass but-ter in April He goes and hunts for his oil so as to be sure of its fresh-ness and gen-uine-ness even as the trav-eller on the prair-ie hunts up his own sup-per of game CHAPTER 98 Stow-ing Down and Clear-ing Up Al-ready has it been re-lat-ed how the great leviathan is afar off de-scried from the mast head how he is chased over the wa-tery moors and slaugh-tered in the val-leys of the deep how he is then towed alongside and be-head-ed and how on the prin-ci-ple which en-ti-tled the heads-man of old to the gar-men-ts in which the be-head-ed was killed his great padded surtout be-comes the prop-er-ty of his ex-e-cu-tion-er how in due time he is con-demned to the pots and like Shadrach Me-shach and Abed-ne-go his sper-ma-ceti oil and bone pass un-scathed through the fire  but now it re-mains to con-clude the last chap-ter of this part of the de-scrip-tion by re-hears-ing singing if I may the ro-man-tic pro-ceed-ing of de-cant-ing off his oil in-to the casks and strik-ing them down in-to the hold where on-ce again leviathan re-turns to his na-tive pro-fun-di-ties slid-ing along be-neath the sur-face as be-fore but alas nev-er more to rise and blow While still warm the oil like hot punch is re-ceived in-to the six bar-rel casks and while per-haps the ship is pitch-ing and rolling this way and that in the mid-night sea the enor-mous casks are slewed round and head-ed over end for end and some-times per-ilous-ly scoot across the slip-pery deck like so many land slides till at last man han-dled and stayed in their course and all round the hoops rap rap go as many ham-mers as can play up-on them for now ex of-fi-cio ev-ery sailor is a coop-er At length when the last pint is casked and all is cool then the great hatch-ways are un-sealed the bow-els of the ship are thrown open and down go the casks to their fi-nal rest in the sea This done the hatch-es are re-placed and her-met-i-cal-ly closed like a clos-et walled up In the sperm fish-ery this is per-haps one of the most re-mark-able in-ci-den-ts in all the busi-ness of whal-ing One day the planks stream with freshets of blood and oil on the sa-cred quar-ter deck enor-mous mass-es of the whale s head are pro-fane-ly piled great rusty casks lie about as in a brew-ery yard the smoke from the try works has be-soot-ed all the bul-warks the mariners go about suf-fused with unc-tu-ous-ness the en-tire ship seems great leviathan him-self while on all hands the din is deaf-en-ing But a day or two af-ter you look about you and prick your ears in this self same ship and were it not for the tell tale boats and try works you would all but swear you trod some silent mer-chant ves-sel with a most scrupu-lous-ly neat com-man-der The un-man-u-fac-tured sperm oil pos-sess-es a sin-gu-lar-ly cleans-ing virtue This is the rea-son why the decks nev-er look so white as just af-ter what they call an af-fair of oil Be-sides from the ash-es of the burned scraps of the whale a po-tent lye is read-i-ly made and when-ev-er any ad-he-sive-ness from the back of the whale re-mains cling-ing to the side that lye quick-ly ex-ter-mi-nates it Hands go dili-gent-ly along the bul-warks and with buck-ets of wa-ter and rags re-store them to their full tidi-ness The soot is brushed from the low-er rig-ging All the nu-mer-ous im-ple-men-ts which have been in use are like-wise faith-ful-ly cleansed and put away The great hatch is scrubbed and placed up-on the try works com-plete-ly hid-ing the pots ev-ery cask is out of sight all tack-les are coiled in un-seen nooks and when by the com-bined and si-mul-ta-ne-ous in-dus-try of al-most the en-tire ship s com-pa-ny the whole of this con-sci-en-tious du-ty is at last con-clud-ed then the crew them-selves pro-ceed to their own ablu-tions shift them-selves from top to toe and fi-nal-ly is-sue to the im-mac-u-late deck fresh and all aglow as bride-grooms new leaped from out the dain-ti-est Hol-land Now with elat-ed step they pace the planks in twos and threes and hu-mor-ous-ly dis-course of par-lors so-fas car-pets and fine cam-brics pro-pose to mat the deck think of hav-ing hang-ing to the top ob-ject not to tak-ing tea by moon-light on the pi-az-za of the fore-castle To hint to such musked mariners of oil and bone and blub-ber were lit-tle short of au-dac-i-ty They know not the thing you dis-tant-ly al-lude to Away and bring us nap-kins But mark aloft there at the three mast heads stand three men in-tent on spy-ing out more whales which if caught in-fal-li-bly will again soil the old oak-en fur-ni-ture and drop at least one small grease spot some-where Yes and many is the time when af-ter the sever-est un-in-ter-rupt-ed labors which know no night con-tin-u-ing straight through for nine-ty six hours when from the boat where they have swelled their wrists with all day row-ing on the Line  they on-ly step to the deck to car-ry vast chains and heave the heavy wind-lass and cut and slash yea and in their very sweat-ings to be smoked and burned anew by the com-bined fires of the equa-to-ri-al sun and the equa-to-ri-al try works when on the heel of all this they have fi-nal-ly be-stirred them-selves to cleanse the ship and make a spot-less dairy room of it many is the time the poor fel-lows just but-ton-ing the necks of their clean frocks are star-tled by the cry of  There she blows  and away they fly to fight an-oth-er whale and go through the whole weary thing again Oh my friends but this is man killing Yet this is life For hard-ly have we mor-tals by long toil-ings ex-tract-ed from this world s vast bulk its small but valu-able sperm and then with weary pa-tience cleansed our-selves from its de-file-men-ts and learned to live here in clean taber-na-cles of the soul hard-ly is this done when There she blows  the ghost is spout-ed up and away we sail to fight some oth-er world and go through young life s old rou-tine again Oh the metempsy-chosis Oh Pythago-ras that in bright Greece two thou-sand years ago did die so good so wise so mild I sailed with thee along the Peru-vian coast last voy-age and fool-ish as I am taught thee a green sim-ple boy how to splice a rope CHAPTER 99 The Dou-bloon Ere now it has been re-lat-ed how Ahab was wont to pace his quar-ter deck tak-ing reg-u-lar turns at ei-ther lim-it the bin-na-cle and main-mast but in the mul-ti-plic-i-ty of oth-er things re-quir-ing nar-ra-tion it has not been added how that some-times in the-se walks when most plunged in his mood he was wont to pause in turn at each spot and stand there strange-ly eye-ing the par-tic-u-lar ob-ject be-fore him When he halt-ed be-fore the bin-na-cle with his glance fas-tened on the point-ed needle in the com-pass that glance shot like a javelin with the point-ed in-ten-si-ty of his pur-pose and when re-sum-ing his walk he again paused be-fore the main-mast then as the same riv-et-ed glance fas-tened up-on the riv-et-ed gold coin there he still wore the same as-pect of nailed firm-ness on-ly dashed with a cer-tain wild long-ing if not hope-ful-ness But one morn-ing turn-ing to pass the dou-bloon he seemed to be new-ly at-tract-ed by the strange fig-ures and in-scrip-tions stamped on it as though now for the first time be-gin-ning to in-ter-pret for him-self in some mono-ma-ni-ac way what-ev-er sig-nif-i-cance might lurk in them And some cer-tain sig-nif-i-cance lurks in all things else all things are lit-tle worth and the round world it-self but an emp-ty ci-pher ex-cept to sell by the cart-load as they do hills about Bos-ton to fill up some morass in the Milky Way Now this dou-bloon was of purest vir-gin gold raked some-where out of the heart of gor-geous hills whence east and west over gold-en sands the head wa-ters of many a Pac-to-lus flows And though now nailed amid-st all the rusti-ness of iron bolts and the verdi-gris of cop-per spikes yet un-touch-able and im-mac-u-late to any foul-ness it still pre-served its Quito glow Nor though placed amongst a ruth-less crew and ev-ery hour passed by ruth-less hands and through the live-long nights shroud-ed with thick dark-ness which might cov-er any pil-fer-ing ap-proach nev-er-the-less ev-ery sun-rise found the dou-bloon where the sun-set left it last For it was set apart and sanc-ti-fied to one awe strik-ing end and how-ev-er wan-ton in their sailor ways one and all the mariners revered it as the white whale s tal-is-man Some-times they talked it over in the weary watch by night won-der-ing whose it was to be at last and whether he would ev-er live to spend it Now those no-ble gold-en coins of South Amer-i-ca are as medals of the sun and trop-ic to-ken pieces Here palms al-pacas and vol-ca-noes sun s disks and stars eclip-tics horns of plen-ty and rich ban-ners wav-ing are in lux-u-ri-ant pro-fu-sion stamped so that the pre-cious gold seems al-most to de-rive an added pre-cious-ness and en-hanc-ing glo-ries by pass-ing through those fan-cy mints so Span-ish-ly po-et-ic It so chanced that the dou-bloon of the Pe-quod was a most wealthy ex-am-ple of the-se things On its round bor-der it bore the let-ters REPUBLICA DEL ECUADOR QUITO So this bright coin came from a coun-try plant-ed in the mid-dle of the world and be-neath the great equa-tor and named af-ter it and it had been cast mid-way up the An-des in the un-wan-ing clime that knows no au-tumn Zoned by those let-ters you saw the like-ness of three An-des sum-mits from one a flame a tow-er on an-oth-er on the third a crow-ing cock while arch-ing over all was a seg-ment of the par-ti-tioned zo-di-ac the signs all marked with their usu-al ca-bal-is-tics and the key-stone sun en-ter-ing the equinoc-tial point at Li-bra Be-fore this equa-to-ri-al coin Ahab not un-ob-served by oth-ers was now paus-ing  There s some-thing ev-er ego-tis-ti-cal in moun-tain tops and tow-ers and all oth-er grand and lofty things look here  three peaks as proud as Lu-cifer The firm tow-er that is Ahab the vol-cano that is Ahab the coura-geous the un-daunt-ed and vic-to-ri-ous fowl that too is Ahab all are Ahab and this round gold is but the im-age of the rounder globe which like a ma-gi-cian s glass to each and ev-ery man in turn but mir-rors back his own mys-te-ri-ous self Great pains small gains for those who ask the world to solve them it can-not solve it-self Me-thinks now this coined sun wears a rud-dy face but see aye he en-ters the sign of stor-ms the equinox and but six months be-fore he wheeled out of a for-mer equinox at Aries From storm to storm So be it then Born in throes  tis fit that man should live in pains and die in pangs So be it then Here s stout stuff for woe to work on So be it then   No fairy fin-gers can have pressed the gold but dev-il s claws must have left their mould-ings there since yes-ter-day  mur-mured Star-buck to him-self lean-ing again-st the bul-warks  The old man seems to read Bels-haz-zar s aw-ful writ-ing I have nev-er marked the coin in-spect-ing-ly He goes be-low let me read A dark val-ley be-tween three mighty heav-en abid-ing peaks that al-most seem the Trin-i-ty in some faint earth-ly sym-bol So in this vale of Death God girds us round and over all our gloom the sun of Righ-teous-ness still shi-nes a bea-con and a hope If we bend down our eyes the dark vale shows her mouldy soil but if we lift them the bright sun meets our glance half way to cheer Yet oh the great sun is no fix-ture and if at mid-night we would fain snatch some sweet so-lace from him we gaze for him in vain This coin speaks wise-ly mild-ly tru-ly but still sad-ly to me I will quit it lest Truth shake me false-ly   There now s the old Mogul  so-lil-o-quized Stubb by the try works  he s been twig-ging it and there goes Star-buck from the same and both with faces which I should say might be some-where with-in nine fath-oms long And all from look-ing at a piece of gold which did I have it now on Ne-gro Hill or in Cor-laer s Hook I d not look at it very long ere spend-ing it Humph in my poor in-signif-i-cant opin-ion I re-gard this as queer I have seen dou-bloons be-fore now in my voy-ag-ings your dou-bloons of old Spain your dou-bloons of Peru your dou-bloons of Chili your dou-bloons of Bo-livia your dou-bloons of Po-payan with plen-ty of gold moidores and pis-toles and joes and half joes and quar-ter joes What then should there be in this dou-bloon of the Equa-tor that is so killing won-der-ful By Gol-con-da let me read it on-ce Hal-loa here s signs and won-ders tru-ly That now is what old Bowditch in his Epit-o-me cal-ls the zo-di-ac and what my al-manac be-low cal-ls dit-to I ll get the al-manac and as I have heard dev-ils can be raised with Dabol-l s arith-metic I ll try my hand at rais-ing a mean-ing out of the-se queer cur-vicues here with the Mas-sachuset-ts cal-en-dar Here s the book Let s see now Signs and won-ders and the sun he s al-ways among  em Hem hem hem here they are here they go all alive  Aries or the Ram Tau-rus or the Bull and Jim-imi here s Gem-i-ni him-self or the Twins Well the sun he wheels among  em Aye here on the coin he s just cross-ing the thresh-old be-tween two of twelve sit-ting rooms all in a ring Book you lie there the fact is you books must know your places You ll do to give us the bare words and fac-ts but we come in to sup-ply the thoughts That s my small ex-pe-ri-ence so far as the Mas-sachuset-ts cal-en-dar and Bowditch s nav-i-ga-tor and Dabol-l s arith-metic go Signs and won-ders eh Pi-ty if there is noth-ing won-der-ful in signs and sig-nif-i-cant in won-ders There s a clue some-where wait a bit hist hark By Jove I have it Look you Dou-bloon your zo-di-ac here is the life of man in one round chap-ter and now I ll read it off straight out of the book Come Al-manack To be-gin there s Aries or the Ram lech-er-ous dog he begets us then Tau-rus or the Bul-l he bumps us the first thing then Gem-i-ni or the Twin-s that is Virtue and Vice we try to reach Virtue when lo comes Cancer the Crab and drags us back and here go-ing from Virtue Leo a roar-ing Lion lies in the path he gives a few fierce bites and surly dabs with his paw we es-cape and hail Vir-go the Vir-gin that s our first love we mar-ry and think to be hap-py for aye when pop comes Li-bra or the Scales hap-pi-ness weighed and found want-ing and while we are very sad about that Lord how we sud-den-ly jump as Scor-pio or the Scor-pi-on stings us in the rear we are cur-ing the wound when whang come the ar-rows all round Sagit-tar-ius or the Archer is amus-ing him-self As we pluck out the shafts stand aside here s the bat-ter-ing ram Capri-cor-nus or the Goat full tilt he comes rush-ing and head-long we are tossed when Aquar-ius or the Water bearer pours out his whole del-uge and drowns us and to wind up with Pisces or the Fish-es we sleep There s a ser-mon now writ in high heav-en and the sun goes through it ev-ery year and yet comes out of it all alive and hearty Jollily he aloft there wheels through toil and trou-ble and so alow here does jol-ly Stubb Oh jol-ly s the word for aye Adieu Dou-bloon But stop here comes lit-tle King Post dodge round the try works now and let s hear what he ll have to say There he s be-fore it he ll out with some-thing present-ly So so he s be-gin-ning   I see noth-ing here but a round thing made of gold and who-ev-er rais-es a cer-tain whale this round thing be-longs to him So what s all this star-ing been about It is worth six-teen dol-lars that s true and at two cen-ts the cigar that s nine hun-dred and six-ty cigars I won t smoke dirty pipes like Stubb but I like cigars and here s nine hun-dred and six-ty of them so here goes Flask aloft to spy  em out   Shall I call that wise or fool-ish now if it be re-al-ly wise it has a fool-ish look to it yet if it be re-al-ly fool-ish then has it a sort of wi-seish look to it But avast here comes our old Manx-man the old hearse driver he must have been that is be-fore he took to the sea He luffs up be-fore the dou-bloon hal-loa and goes round on the oth-er side of the mast why there s a horse shoe nailed on that side and now he s back again what does that mean Hark he s mut-ter-ing voice like an old worn out cof-fee mill Prick ears and lis-ten   If the White Whale be raised it must be in a mon-th and a day when the sun stands in some one of the-se signs I ve stud-ied signs and know their marks they were taught me two score years ago by the old witch in Copen-hagen Now in what sign will the sun then be The horse shoe sign for there it is right op-po-site the gold And what s the horse shoe sign The li-on is the horse shoe sign the roar-ing and de-vour-ing li-on Ship old ship my old head shakes to think of thee   There s an-oth-er ren-der-ing now but still one text All sorts of men in one kind of world you see Dodge again here comes Quee-queg all tat-too-ing looks like the signs of the Zo-di-ac him-self What says the Can-ni-bal As I live he s com-par-ing notes look-ing at his thigh bone thinks the sun is in the thigh or in the calf or in the bow-els I sup-pose as the old wom-en talk Sur-geon s Astron-o-my in the back coun-try And by Jove he s found some-thing there in the vicin-i-ty of his thigh I guess it s Sagit-tar-ius or the Archer No he don t know what to make of the dou-bloon he takes it for an old but-ton off some king s trowsers But aside again here comes that ghost dev-il Fedal-lah tail coiled out of sight as usu-al oakum in the toes of his pumps as usu-al What does he say with that look of his Ah on-ly makes a sign to the sign and bows him-self there is a sun on the coin fire wor-ship-per de-pend up-on it Ho more and more This way comes Pip poor boy would he had died or I he s half hor-ri-ble to me He too has been watch-ing all of the-se in-ter-preter-s my-self in-clud-ed and look now he comes to read with that un-earth-ly id-iot face Stand away again and hear him Hark   I look you look he looks we look ye look they look   Upon my soul he s been study-ing Mur-ray s Gram-mar Im-prov-ing his mind poor fel-low But what s that he says now hist   I look you look he looks we look ye look they look   Why he s get-ting it by heart hist again   I look you look he looks we look ye look they look   Well that s fun-ny   And I you and he and we ye and they are all bats and I m a crow es-pe-cial-ly when I stand a top of this pine tree here Caw caw caw caw caw caw Ain t I a crow And where s the scare crow There he stands two bones stuck in-to a pair of old trowsers and two more poked in-to the sleeves of an old jack-et   Won-der if he means me  com-pli-men-ta-ry  poor lad  I could go hang my-self Any way for the pre-sent I ll quit Pip s vicin-i-ty I can stand the rest for they have plain wits but he s too crazy wit-ty for my san-i-ty So so I leave him mut-ter-ing   Here s the ship s navel this dou-bloon here and they are all on fire to un-screw it But un-screw your navel and what s the con-se-quence Then again if it stays here that is ug-ly too for when augh-t s nailed to the mast it s a sign that things grow des-per-ate Ha ha old Ahab the White Whale he ll nail ye This is a pine tree My fa-ther in old Tol-land coun-ty cut down a pine tree on-ce and found a sil-ver ring grown over in it some old dark-ey s wed-ding ring How did it get there And so they ll say in the res-ur-rec-tion when they come to fish up this old mast and find a dou-bloon lodged in it with bed-ded oys-ters for the shag-gy bark Oh the gold the pre-cious pre-cious gold the green mis-er ll hoard ye soon Hish hish God goes  mong the worlds black-ber-ry-ing Cook ho cook and cook us Jen-ny hey hey hey hey hey Jen-ny Jen-ny and get your hoe cake done  CHAPTER 1 Leg and Arm The Pe-quod of Nan-tuck-et Meets the Sa-muel En-der-by of Lon-don  Ship ahoy Hast seen the White Whale  So cried Ahab on-ce more hail-ing a ship show-ing English colours bear-ing down un-der the stern Trum-pet to mouth the old man was stand-ing in his hoist-ed quar-ter boat his ivory leg plain-ly re-vealed to the stranger cap-tain who was care-less-ly re-clin-ing in his own boat s bow He was a dark-ly tanned burly good na-tured fine look-ing man of six-ty or there-abouts dressed in a spa-cious round-about that hung round him in fes-toons of blue pi-lot cloth and one emp-ty arm of this jack-et streamed be-hind him like the broi-dered arm of a hus-sar s sur-coat  Hast seen the White Whale   See you this  and with-draw-ing it from the folds that had hid-den it he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone ter-mi-nat-ing in a wood-en head like a mal-let  Man my boat  cried Ahab im-petu-ous-ly and toss-ing about the oars near him  Stand by to low-er  In less than a min-ute with-out quit-ting his lit-tle craft he and his crew were dropped to the wa-ter and were soon alongside of the stranger But here a cu-ri-ous dif-fi-cul-ty pre-sent-ed it-self In the ex-cite-ment of the mo-ment Ahab had for-got-ten that since the loss of his leg he had nev-er on-ce stepped on board of any ves-sel at sea but his own and then it was al-ways by an in-ge-nious and very handy me-chan-i-cal con-trivance pe-cu-liar to the Pe-quod and a thing not to be rigged and shipped in any oth-er ves-sel at a mo-men-t s warn-ing Now it is no very easy mat-ter for any-body ex-cept those who are al-most hourly used to it like whale-men to clam-ber up a ship s side from a boat on the open sea for the great swells now lift the boat high up to-wards the bul-warks and then in-stan-ta-neous-ly drop it half way down to the kel-son So de-prived of one leg and the strange ship of course be-ing al-to-geth-er un-sup-plied with the kind-ly in-ven-tion Ahab now found him-self ab-ject-ly re-duced to a clum-sy lands-man again hope-less-ly eye-ing the un-cer-tain change-ful height he could hard-ly hope to at-tain It has be-fore been hint-ed per-haps that ev-ery lit-tle un-to-ward cir-cum-stance that be-fell him and which in-di-rect-ly sprang from his luck-less mishap al-most in-vari-ably ir-ri-tat-ed or ex-as-per-at-ed Ahab And in the pre-sent in-stance all this was height-ened by the sight of the two of-fi-cers of the strange ship lean-ing over the side by the per-pen-dic-u-lar lad-der of nailed cleets there and swing-ing to-wards him a pair of taste-ful-ly or-na-ment-ed man ropes for at first they did not seem to be-think them that a one legged man must be too much of a crip-ple to use their sea ban-nis-ters But this awk-ward-ness on-ly last-ed a min-ute be-cause the strange cap-tain ob-serv-ing at a glance how af-fairs stood cried out  I see I see  avast heav-ing there Jump boys and swing over the cut-ting tack-le  As good luck would have it they had had a whale alongside a day or two pre-vi-ous and the great tack-les were still aloft and the mas-sive curved blub-ber hook now clean and dry was still at-tached to the end This was quick-ly low-ered to Ahab who at on-ce com-pre-hend-ing it all slid his soli-tary thigh in-to the curve of the hook it was like sit-ting in the fluke of an an-chor or the crotch of an ap-ple tree and then giv-ing the word held him-self fast and at the same time al-so helped to hoist his own weight by pulling hand over hand up-on one of the run-ning parts of the tack-le Soon he was care-ful-ly swung in-side the high bul-warks and gen-tly land-ed up-on the cap-stan head With his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in wel-come the oth-er cap-tain ad-vanced and Ahab putting out his ivory leg and cross-ing the ivory arm like two sword fish blades cried out in his wal-rus way  Aye aye hearty let us shake bones to-geth-er  an arm and a leg  an arm that nev-er can shrink d ye see and a leg that nev-er can run Where did st thou see the White Whale  how long ago   The White Whale  said the English-man point-ing his ivory arm to-wards the East and tak-ing a rue-ful sight along it as if it had been a tele-scope  there I saw him on the Line last sea-son   And he took that arm off did he  asked Ahab now slid-ing down from the cap-stan and rest-ing on the English-man s shoul-der as he did so  Aye he was the cause of it at least and that leg too   Spin me the yarn  said Ahab  how was it   It was the first time in my life that I ev-er cruised on the Line  be-gan the English-man  I was ig-no-rant of the White Whale at that time Well one day we low-ered for a pod of four or five whales and my boat fas-tened to one of them a reg-u-lar cir-cus horse he was too that went milling and milling round so that my boat s crew could on-ly trim dish by sit-ting all their sterns on the out-er gun-wale Present-ly up breach-es from the bot-tom of the sea a bounc-ing great whale with a milky white head and hump all crows feet and wrin-kles   It was he it was he  cried Ahab sud-den-ly let-ting out his sus-pend-ed breath  And har-poons stick-ing in near his star-board fin   Aye aye they were mine my irons  cried Ahab ex-ult-ing-ly  but on   Give me a chance then  said the English-man good hu-mored-ly  Well this old great grand-fa-ther with the white head and hump runs all afoam in-to the pod and goes to snap-ping fu-ri-ous-ly at my fast line  Aye I see  want-ed to part it free the fast fish an old trick I know him   How it was ex-act-ly  con-tin-ued the one armed com-man-der  I do not know but in bit-ing the line it got foul of his teeth caught there some-how but we did-n t know it then so that when we af-ter-wards pulled on the line bounce we came plump on to his hump in-stead of the oth-er whale s that went off to wind-ward all fluk-ing See-ing how mat-ters stood and what a no-ble great whale it was the no-blest and biggest I ev-er saw sir in my life I re-solved to cap-ture him spite of the boil-ing rage he seemed to be in And think-ing the hap haz-ard line would get loose or the tooth it was tan-gled to might draw for I have a dev-il of a boat s crew for a pull on a whale line see-ing all this I say I jumped in-to my first mate s boat Mr Mount-top s here by the way Cap-tain Mount-top Mount-top the cap-tain  as I was say-ing I jumped in-to Mount-top s boat which d ye see was gun-wale and gun-wale with mine then and snatch-ing the first har-poon let this old great grand-fa-ther have it But Lord look you sir hearts and souls alive man the next in-stant in a jiff I was blind as a bat both eyes out all be-fogged and be-dead-ened with black foam the whale s tail loom-ing straight up out of it per-pen-dic-u-lar in the air like a mar-ble steeple No use stern-ing all then but as I was grop-ing at mid-day with a blind-ing sun all crown jew-els as I was grop-ing I say af-ter the sec-ond iron to toss it over-board down comes the tail like a Li-ma tow-er cut-ting my boat in two leav-ing each half in splin-ters and flukes first the white hump backed through the wreck as though it was all chips We all struck out To es-cape his ter-ri-ble flail-ings I seized hold of my har-poon pole stick-ing in him and for a mo-ment clung to that like a suck-ing fish But a comb-ing sea dashed me off and at the same in-stant the fish tak-ing one good dart for-wards went down like a flash and the barb of that cursed sec-ond iron tow-ing along near me caught me here clap-ping his hand just be-low his shoul-der  yes caught me just here I say and bore me down to Hel-l s flames I was think-ing when when all of a sud-den thank the good God the barb ript its way along the flesh clear along the whole length of my ar-m came out nigh my wrist and up I float-ed  and that gen-tle-man there will tell you the rest by the way cap-tain Dr Bunger ship s sur-geon Bunger my lad  the cap-tain Now Bunger boy spin your part of the yarn  The pro-fes-sion-al gen-tle-man thus fa-mil-iar-ly point-ed out had been all the time stand-ing near them with noth-ing speci-fic vis-i-ble to de-note his gen-tle-man-ly rank on board His face was an ex-ceed-ing-ly round but sober one he was dressed in a fad-ed blue wool-len frock or shirt and patched trowsers and had thus far been di-vid-ing his at-ten-tion be-tween a mar-lingspike he held in one hand and a pill box held in the oth-er oc-ca-sion-al-ly cast-ing a crit-i-cal glance at the ivory lim-bs of the two crip-pled cap-tains But at his su-pe-ri-or s in-tro-duc-tion of him to Ahab he po-lite-ly bowed and straight-way went on to do his cap-tain s bid-ding  It was a shock-ing bad wound  be-gan the whale sur-geon  and tak-ing my ad-vice Cap-tain Boomer here stood our old Sam-my   Sa-muel En-der-by is the name of my ship  in-ter-rupt-ed the one armed cap-tain ad-dress-ing Ahab  go on boy   Stood our old Sam-my off to the north-ward to get out of the blaz-ing hot weath-er there on the Line But it was no use I did all I could sat up with him nights was very sev-ere with him in the mat-ter of di-et   Oh very sev-ere  chimed in the pa-tient him-self then sud-den-ly al-ter-ing his voice  Drink-ing hot rum tod-dies with me ev-ery night till he could-n t see to put on the ban-dages and send-ing me to bed half seas over about three o clock in the morn-ing Oh ye stars he sat up with me in-deed and was very sev-ere in my di-et Oh a great watcher and very di-etet-i-cal-ly sev-ere is Dr Bunger Bunger you dog laugh out why don t ye You know you re a pre-cious jol-ly ras-cal But heave ahead boy I d rather be killed by you than kept alive by any oth-er man   My cap-tain you must have ere this per-ceived re-spect-ed sir  said the im-per-turbable god-ly look-ing Bunger slight-ly bow-ing to Ahab  is apt to be face-tious at times he spins us many clev-er things of that sort But I may as well say en pas-sant as the French re-mark that I my-self that is to say Jack Bunger late of the rev-erend cler-gy am a strict to-tal ab-sti-nence man I nev-er drink   Water  cried the cap-tain  he nev-er drinks it it s a sort of fits to him fresh wa-ter throws him in-to the hy-dropho-bia but go on go on with the arm sto-ry   Yes I may as well  said the sur-geon cool-ly  I was about ob-serv-ing sir be-fore Cap-tain Boomer s face-tious in-ter-rup-tion that spite of my best and sever-est en-deav-ors the wound kept get-ting worse and worse the truth was sir it was as ug-ly gap-ing wound as sur-geon ev-er saw more than two feet and sev-er-al inch-es long I mea-sured it with the lead line In short it grew black I knew what was threat-ened and off it came But I had no hand in ship-ping that ivory arm there that thing is again-st all rule  point-ing at it with the mar-lingspike  that is the cap-tain s work not mine he or-dered the car-pen-ter to make it he had that club ham-mer there put to the end to knock some one s brains out with I sup-pose as he tried mine on-ce He flies in-to di-a-bol-i-cal pas-sions some-times Do ye see this dent sir  re-mov-ing his hat and brush-ing aside his hair and ex-pos-ing a bowl like cav-i-ty in his skull but which bore not the slight-est scar-ry trace or any to-ken of ev-er hav-ing been a wound  Well the cap-tain there will tell you how that came here he knows   No I don t  said the cap-tain  but his moth-er did he was born with it Oh you solemn rogue you you Bunger was there ev-er such an-oth-er Bunger in the wa-tery world Bunger when you die you ought to die in pick-le you dog you should be pre-served to fu-ture ages you ras-cal   What be-came of the White Whale  now cried Ahab who thus far had been im-pa-tient-ly lis-ten-ing to this by play be-tween the two English-men  Oh  cried the one armed cap-tain  oh yes Well af-ter he sound-ed we did-n t see him again for some time in fact as I be-fore hint-ed I did-n t then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick till some time af-ter-wards when com-ing back to the Line we heard about Moby Dick as some call him and then I knew it was he   Did st thou cross his wake again   Twice   But could not fas-ten   Did-n t want to try to ain t one limb enough What should I do with-out this oth-er arm And I m think-ing Moby Dick does-n t bite so much as he swal-lows   Well then  in-ter-rupt-ed Bunger  give him your left arm for bait to get the right Do you know gen-tle-men  very grave-ly and math-e-mat-i-cal-ly bow-ing to each Cap-tain in suc-ces-sion  Do you know gen-tle-men that the di-ges-tive or-gans of the whale are so in-scrutably con-struct-ed by Divine Prov-i-dence that it is quite im-pos-si-ble for him to com-plete-ly di-gest even a man s arm And he knows it too So that what you take for the White Whale s mal-ice is on-ly his awk-ward-ness For he nev-er means to swal-low a sin-gle limb he on-ly thinks to ter-ri-fy by fein-ts But some-times he is like the old jug-gling fel-low for-mer-ly a pa-tient of mine in Cey-lon that mak-ing be-lieve swal-low jack knives on-ce up-on a time let one drop in-to him in good earnest and there it stayed for a twelve-mon-th or more when I gave him an emet-ic and he heaved it up in small tacks d ye see No pos-si-ble way for him to di-gest that jack knife and ful-ly in-cor-po-rate it in-to his gen-er-al bod-i-ly sys-tem Yes Cap-tain Boomer if you are quick enough about it and have a mind to pawn one arm for the sake of the priv-i-lege of giv-ing de-cent buri-al to the oth-er why in that case the arm is yours on-ly let the whale have an-oth-er chance at you short-ly that s all   No thank ye Bunger  said the English Cap-tain  he s wel-come to the arm he has since I can t help it and did-n t know him then but not to an-oth-er one No more White Whales for me I ve low-ered for him on-ce and that has sat-is-fied me There would be great glo-ry in killing him I know that and there is a ship load of pre-cious sperm in him but hark ye he s best let alone don t you think so Cap-tain   glanc-ing at the ivory leg  He is But he will still be hunt-ed for all that What is best let alone that ac-cursed thing is not al-ways what least al-lures He s all a mag-net How long since thou saw st him last Which way head-ing   Bless my soul and curse the foul fiend s  cried Bunger stoop-ing-ly walk-ing round Ahab and like a dog strange-ly snuff-ing  this man s blood bring the ther-mome-ter  it s at the boil-ing point  his pulse makes the-se planks beat  sir   tak-ing a lancet from his pock-et and draw-ing near to Ahab s arm  Avast  roared Ahab dash-ing him again-st the bul-wark-s  Man the boat Which way head-ing   Good God  cried the English Cap-tain to whom the ques-tion was put  What s the mat-ter He was head-ing east I think  Is your Cap-tain crazy  whis-per-ing Fedal-lah But Fedal-lah putting a fin-ger on his lip slid over the bul-warks to take the boat s steer-ing oar and Ahab swing-ing the cut-ting tack-le to-wards him com-mand-ed the ship s sailors to stand by to low-er In a mo-ment he was stand-ing in the boat s stern and the Manil-la men were spring-ing to their oars In vain the English Cap-tain hailed him With back to the stranger ship and face set like a flint to his own Ahab stood up-right till alongside of the Pe-quod CHAPTER 11 The De-can-ter Ere the English ship fades from sight be it set down here that she hailed from Lon-don and was named af-ter the late Sa-muel En-der-by mer-chant of that city the orig-i-nal of the fa-mous whal-ing house of En-der-by Sons a house which in my poor whale-man s opin-ion comes not far be-hind the unit-ed roy-al hous-es of the Tu-dors and Bour-bons in point of re-al his-tor-i-cal in-ter-est How long pri-or to the year of our Lord 1775 this great whal-ing house was in ex-is-tence my nu-mer-ous fish doc-u-men-ts do not make plain but in that year 1775 it fit-ted out the first English ships that ev-er reg-u-lar-ly hunt-ed the Sperm Whale though for some score of years pre-vi-ous ev-er since 1726 our valiant Coffins and Maceys of Nan-tuck-et and the Vine-yard had in large fleets pur-sued that Le-viathan but on-ly in the North and South At-lantic not else-where Be it dis-tinct-ly record-ed here that the Nan-tuck-eters were the first among mankind to har-poon with civ-i-lized steel the great Sperm Whale and that for half a cen-tu-ry they were the on-ly peo-ple of the whole globe who so har-pooned him In 1778 a fine ship the Amelia fit-ted out for the ex-press pur-pose and at the sole charge of the vig-or-ous En-der-bys bold-ly round-ed Cape Horn and was the first among the na-tions to low-er a whale boat of any sort in the great South Sea The voy-age was a skil-ful and lucky one and re-turn-ing to her berth with her hold full of the pre-cious sperm the Ameli-a s ex-am-ple was soon fol-lowed by oth-er ships English and Amer-i-can and thus the vast Sperm Whale grounds of the Paci-fic were thrown open But not con-tent with this good deed the in-de-fati-ga-ble house again be-stirred it-self Sa-muel and all his Son-s how many their moth-er on-ly knows and un-der their im-me-di-ate aus-pices and part-ly I think at their ex-pense the Bri-tish gov-ern-ment was in-duced to send the sloop of war Rat-tler on a whal-ing voy-age of dis-cov-ery in-to the South Sea Com-mand-ed by a naval Post Cap-tain the Rat-tler made a rat-tling voy-age of it and did some ser-vice how much does not ap-pear But this is not all In 1819 the same house fit-ted out a dis-cov-ery whale ship of their own to go on a tast-ing cruise to the re-mote wa-ters of Ja-pan That ship well called the  Syren  made a no-ble ex-per-i-men-tal cruise and it was thus that the great Ja-pane-se Whal-ing Ground first be-came gen-er-al-ly known The Syren in this fa-mous voy-age was com-mand-ed by a Cap-tain Coffin a Nan-tuck-eter All hon-or to the En-der-bies there-fore whose house I think ex-ists to the pre-sent day though doubtless the orig-i-nal Sa-muel must long ago have slipped his ca-ble for the great South Sea of the oth-er world The ship named af-ter him was wor-thy of the hon-or be-ing a very fast sail-er and a no-ble craft ev-ery way I board-ed her on-ce at mid-night some-where off the Patag-o-ni-an coast and drank good flip down in the fore-castle It was a fine gam we had and they were all trump-s ev-ery soul on board A short life to them and a jol-ly death And that fine gam I had long very long af-ter old Ahab touched her planks with his ivory heel it minds me of the no-ble solid Sax-on hos-pi-tal-i-ty of that ship and may my par-son for-get me and the dev-il re-mem-ber me if I ev-er lose sight of it Flip Did I say we had flip Yes and we flipped it at the rate of ten gal-lons the hour and when the squall came for it s squally off there by Patag-o-nia and all hand-s vis-i-tors and al-l were called to reef top-sails we were so top heavy that we had to swing each oth-er aloft in bow-li-nes and we ig-no-rant-ly furled the skirts of our jack-ets in-to the sails so that we hung there reefed fast in the howl-ing gale a warn-ing ex-am-ple to all drunk-en tars How-ev-er the mas-ts did not go over-board and by and by we scram-bled down so sober that we had to pass the flip again though the sav-age salt spray burst-ing down the fore-castle scut-tle rather too much di-lut-ed and pick-led it to my taste The beef was fine tough but with body in it They said it was bull beef oth-ers that it was dromedary beef but I do not know for cer-tain how that was They had dumplings too small but sub-stan-tial sym-met-ri-cal-ly glob-u-lar and in-de-struc-tible dumplings I fan-cied that you could feel them and roll them about in you af-ter they were swal-lowed If you stooped over too far for-ward you risked their pitch-ing out of you like bil-liard bal-ls The bread but that could-n t be helped be-sides it was an an-ti scor-bu-tic in short the bread con-tained the on-ly fresh fare they had But the fore-castle was not very light and it was very easy to step over in-to a dark cor-ner when you ate it But all in all tak-ing her from truck to helm con-sid-er-ing the di-men-sions of the cook s boil-ers in-clud-ing his own live parch-ment boil-ers fore and aft I say the Sa-muel En-der-by was a jol-ly ship of good fare and plen-ty fine flip and strong crack fel-lows all and cap-i-tal from boot heels to hat band But why was it think ye that the Sa-muel En-der-by and some oth-er English whalers I know of not all though were such fa-mous hos-pitable ships that passed round the beef and the bread and the can and the joke and were not soon weary of eat-ing and drink-ing and laugh-ing I will tell you The abound-ing good cheer of the-se English whalers is mat-ter for his-tor-i-cal re-search Nor have I been at all spar-ing of his-tor-i-cal whale re-search when it has seemed need-ed The English were pre-ced-ed in the whale fish-ery by the Hol-lan-ders Zealan-ders and Danes from whom they de-rived many ter-ms still ex-tant in the fish-ery and what is yet more their fat old fash-ions touch-ing plen-ty to eat and drink For as a gen-er-al thing the English mer-chant ship scrim-ps her crew but not so the English whaler Hence in the English this thing of whal-ing good cheer is not nor-mal and nat-u-ral but in-ci-den-tal and par-tic-u-lar and there-fore must have some spe-cial orig-in which is here point-ed out and will be still fur-ther elu-ci-dat-ed Dur-ing my re-search-es in the Le-viathanic his-to-ries I stum-bled up-on an an-cient Dutch vol-ume which by the musty whal-ing smell of it I knew must be about whalers The ti-tle was  Dan Coop-man  where-fore I con-clud-ed that this must be the in-valu-able mem-oirs of some Am-s-ter-dam coop-er in the fish-ery as ev-ery whale ship must car-ry its coop-er I was re-in-forced in this opin-ion by see-ing that it was the pro-duc-tion of one  Fitz Swack-ham-mer  But my friend Dr Sn-od-head a very learned man pro-fes-sor of Low Dutch and High Ger-man in the col-lege of San-ta Claus and St Pot-t s to whom I hand-ed the work for trans-la-tion giv-ing him a box of sperm can-dles for his trou-ble this same Dr Sn-od-head so soon as he spied the book as-sured me that  Dan Coop-man did not mean  The Coop-er  but  The Mer-chant  In short this an-cient and learned Low Dutch book treat-ed of the com-merce of Hol-land and among oth-er sub-jec-ts con-tained a very in-ter-est-ing ac-count of its whale fish-ery And in this chap-ter it was head-ed  Smeer  or  Fat  that I found a long de-tailed list of the out-fits for the larders and cel-lars of 18 sail of Dutch whale-men from which list as trans-lat-ed by Dr Sn-od-head I tran-scribe the fol-low-ing 4  lbs of beef 6  lbs Fries-land pork 15  lbs of stock fish 55  lbs of bis-cuit 72  lbs of soft bread 2 8 firkins of but-ter 2  lbs Tex-el Ley-den cheese 144  lbs cheese prob-a-bly an in-fe-ri-or ar-ti-cle 55 ankers of Geneva 1 8 bar-rels of beer Most sta-tis-ti-cal ta-bles are parch-ing-ly dry in the read-ing not so in the pre-sent case how-ev-er where the read-er is flood-ed with whole pipes bar-rels quar-ts and gills of good gin and good cheer At the time I de-vot-ed three days to the stu-dious di-gest-ing of all this beer beef and bread dur-ing which many pro-found thoughts were in-ci-den-tal-ly sug-gest-ed to me ca-pa-ble of a tran-scen-den-tal and Pla-ton-ic ap-pli-ca-tion and fur-ther-more I com-piled sup-ple-men-tary ta-bles of my own touch-ing the prob-a-ble quan-ti-ty of stock fish etc con-sumed by ev-ery Low Dutch har-pooneer in that an-cient Green-land and Spitzber-gen whale fish-ery In the first place the amount of but-ter and Tex-el and Ley-den cheese con-sumed seems amaz-ing I im-pute it though to their nat-u-ral-ly unc-tu-ous na-tures be-ing ren-dered still more unc-tu-ous by the na-ture of their vo-ca-tion and es-pe-cial-ly by their pur-su-ing their game in those frigid Po-lar Seas on the very coasts of that Esquimaux coun-try where the con-vivial na-tives pledge each oth-er in bumpers of train oil The quan-ti-ty of beer too is very large 1 8 bar-rels Now as those po-lar fish-eries could on-ly be pros-e-cut-ed in the short sum-mer of that cli-mate so that the whole cruise of one of the-se Dutch whale-men in-clud-ing the short voy-age to and from the Spitzber-gen sea did not much ex-ceed three months say and reck-on-ing 3 men to each of their fleet of 18 sail we have 5 4 Low Dutch sea-men in all there-fore I say we have pre-cise-ly two bar-rels of beer per man for a twelve week-s al-lowance ex-clu-sive of his fair pro-por-tion of that 55 ankers of gin Now whether the-se gin and beer har-pooneers so fud-dled as one might fan-cy them to have been were the right sort of men to stand up in a boat s head and take good aim at fly-ing whales this would seem some-what im-prob-a-ble Yet they did aim at them and hit them too But this was very far North be it re-mem-bered where beer agrees well with the con-sti-tu-tion up-on the Equa-tor in our south-ern fish-ery beer would be apt to make the har-pooneer sleepy at the mast head and boozy in his boat and grievous loss might en-sue to Nan-tuck-et and New Bed-ford But no more enough has been said to show that the old Dutch whalers of two or three cen-turies ago were high liv-ers and that the English whalers have not ne-glect-ed so ex-cel-lent an ex-am-ple For say they when cruis-ing in an emp-ty ship if you can get noth-ing bet-ter out of the world get a good din-ner out of it at least And this emp-ties the de-canter CHAPTER 12 A Bow-er in the Ar-sacides Hither-to in de-scrip-tive-ly treat-ing of the Sperm Whale I have chiefly dwelt up-on the mar-vels of his out-er as-pect or sep-a-rate-ly and in de-tail up-on some few in-te-ri-or struc-tural fea-tures But to a large and thor-ough sweep-ing com-pre-hen-sion of him it be-hooves me now to un-but-ton him still fur-ther and un-tag-ging the points of his hose un-buck-ling his garters and cast-ing loose the hooks and the eyes of the join-ts of his in-ner-most bones set him be-fore you in his ul-ti-ma-tum that is to say in his un-con-di-tion-al skele-ton But how now Ish-mael How is it that you a mere oars-man in the fish-ery pre-tend to know aught about the sub-ter-ranean parts of the whale Did eru-dite Stubb mount-ed up-on your cap-stan de-liv-er lec-tures on the anato-my of the Ce-tacea and by help of the wind-lass hold up a spec-i-men rib for ex-hi-bi-tion Ex-plain thy-self Ish-mael Can you land a full grown whale on your deck for ex-am-i-na-tion as a cook dish-es a roast pig Sure-ly not A ver-i-ta-ble wit-ness have you hith-er-to been Ish-mael but have a care how you seize the priv-i-lege of Jon-ah alone the priv-i-lege of dis-cours-ing up-on the joists and beams the rafters ridge pole sleep-ers and un-der pin-nings mak-ing up the frame work of leviathan and be-like of the tal-low vats dairy rooms but-ter-ies and cheeseries in his bow-els I con-fess that since Jon-ah few whale-men have pen-e-trat-ed very far be-neath the skin of the adult whale nev-er-the-less I have been blessed with an op-por-tu-ni-ty to dis-sect him in minia-ture In a ship I be-longed to a small cub Sperm Whale was on-ce bod-i-ly hoist-ed to the deck for his poke or bag to make sheaths for the bar-bs of the har-poons and for the heads of the lances Think you I let that chance go with-out us-ing my boat hatch-et and jack knife and break-ing the seal and read-ing all the con-tents of that young cub And as for my ex-act knowl-edge of the bones of the leviathan in their gi-gan-tic full grown de-vel-op-ment for that rare knowl-edge I am in-debt-ed to my late roy-al friend Tran-quo king of Tran-que one of the Ar-sacides For be-ing at Tran-que years ago when at-tached to the trad-ing ship Dey of Al-giers I was in-vit-ed to spend part of the Ar-sacidean hol-i-days with the lord of Tran-que at his re-tired palm vil-la at Pu-pel-la a sea side glen not very far dis-tant from what our sailors called Bam-boo Town his cap-i-tal Among many oth-er fine qual-i-ties my roy-al friend Tran-quo be-ing gift-ed with a de-vout love for all mat-ters of bar-bar-ic ver-tu had brought to-geth-er in Pu-pel-la what-ev-er rare things the more in-ge-nious of his peo-ple could in-vent chiefly carved woods of won-der-ful de-vices chis-elled shel-ls in-laid spears cost-ly pad-dles aro-mat-ic ca-noes and all the-se dis-tribut-ed among what-ev-er nat-u-ral won-ders the won-der freight-ed trib-ute ren-der-ing waves had cast up-on his shores Chief among the-se lat-ter was a great Sperm Whale which af-ter an un-usu-al-ly long rag-ing gale had been found dead and strand-ed with his head again-st a co-coa nut tree whose plumage like tuft-ed droop-ings seemed his ver-dant jet When the vast body had at last been stripped of its fath-om deep en-fold-ings and the bones be-come dust dry in the sun then the skele-ton was care-ful-ly trans-port-ed up the Pu-pel-la glen where a grand tem-ple of lord-ly palms now shel-tered it The ribs were hung with tro-phies the ver-te-br were carved with Ar-sacidean an-nals in strange hi-ero-glyph-ics in the skull the priests kept up an un-ex-tin-guished aro-mat-ic flame so that the mys-tic head again sent forth its va-pory spout while sus-pend-ed from a bough the ter-ri-fic low-er jaw vi-brat-ed over all the devo-tees like the hair hung sword that so af-fright-ed Damo-cles It was a won-drous sight The wood was green as moss-es of the Icy Glen the trees stood high and haughty feel-ing their liv-ing sap the in-dus-tri-ous earth be-neath was as a weaver s loom with a gor-geous car-pet on it where-of the ground vine ten-drils formed the warp and woof and the liv-ing flow-ers the fig-ures All the trees with all their laden branch-es all the shrubs and fer-ns and grass-es the mes-sage car-ry-ing air all the-se un-ceas-ing-ly were ac-tive Through the lac-ings of the leaves the great sun seemed a fly-ing shut-tle weav-ing the un-wea-ried ver-dure Oh busy weaver un-seen weaver  pause  one word  whith-er flows the fab-ric what palace may it deck where-fore all the-se cease-less toil-ings Speak weaver  stay thy hand  but one sin-gle word with thee Nay the shut-tle flies the fig-ures float from forth the loom the freshet rush-ing car-pet for ev-er slides away The weaver god he weaves and by that weav-ing is he deaf-ened that he hears no mor-tal voice and by that hum-ming we too who look on the loom are deaf-ened and on-ly when we es-cape it shall we hear the thou-sand voic-es that speak through it For even so it is in all ma-te-ri-al fac-to-ries The spo-ken words that are in-audi-ble among the fly-ing spindles those same words are plain-ly heard with-out the wal-ls burst-ing from the opened case-men-ts There-by have vil-lainies been de-tect-ed Ah mor-tal then be heed-ful for so in all this din of the great world s loom thy sub-tlest think-ings may be over-heard afar Now amid the green life rest-less loom of that Ar-sacidean wood the great white wor-shipped skele-ton lay loung-ing a gi-gan-tic idler Yet as the ev-er wo-ven ver-dant warp and woof in-ter-mixed and hummed around him the mighty idler seemed the cun-ning weaver him-self all wo-ven over with the vi-nes ev-ery mon-th as-sum-ing green-er fresh-er ver-dure but him-self a skele-ton Life fold-ed Death Death trel-lised Life the grim god wived with youth-ful Life and be-gat him curly head-ed glo-ries Now when with roy-al Tran-quo I vis-it-ed this won-drous whale and saw the skull an al-tar and the ar-ti-fi-cial smoke as-cend-ing from where the re-al jet had is-sued I mar-velled that the king should re-gard a chapel as an ob-ject of ver-tu He laughed But more I mar-velled that the priests should swear that smoky jet of his was gen-uine To and fro I paced be-fore this skele-ton brushed the vi-nes aside broke through the rib-s and with a ball of Ar-sacidean twine wan-dered ed-died long amid its many wind-ing shad-ed colon-nades and ar-bours But soon my line was out and fol-low-ing it back I emerged from the open-ing where I en-tered I saw no liv-ing thing with-in naught was there but bones Cut-ting me a green mea-sur-ing rod I on-ce more dived with-in the skele-ton From their ar-row slit in the skull the priests per-ceived me tak-ing the al-ti-tude of the fi-nal rib  How now  they shout-ed  Dar st thou mea-sure this our god That s for us   Aye priest-s well how long do ye make him then  But here-upon a fierce con-test rose among them con-cern-ing feet and inch-es they cracked each oth-er s scon-ces with their yard stick-s the great skull echoed and seiz-ing that lucky chance I quick-ly con-clud-ed my own ad-mea-sure-men-ts Th-e-se ad-mea-sure-men-ts I now pro-pose to set be-fore you But first be it record-ed that in this mat-ter I am not free to ut-ter any fan-cied mea-sure-ment I please Be-cause there are skele-ton au-thor-i-ties you can refer to to test my ac-cu-ra-cy There is a Le-viathanic Mu-se-um they tell me in Hull Eng-land one of the whal-ing ports of that coun-try where they have some fine spec-i-mens of fin backs and oth-er whales Like-wise I have heard that in the mu-se-um of Manch-ester in New Hamp-shire they have what the pro-pri-etors call  the on-ly per-fect spec-i-men of a Green-land or River Whale in the Unit-ed States  More-over at a place in York-shire Eng-land Bur-ton Con-sta-ble by name a cer-tain Sir Clif-ford Con-sta-ble has in his pos-ses-sion the skele-ton of a Sperm Whale but of mod-er-ate size by no means of the full grown mag-ni-tude of my friend King Tran-quo s In both cas-es the strand-ed whales to which the-se two skele-tons be-longed were orig-i-nal-ly claimed by their pro-pri-etors up-on sim-i-lar grounds King Tran-quo seiz-ing his be-cause he want-ed it and Sir Clif-ford be-cause he was lord of the seignories of those parts Sir Clif-ford s whale has been ar-tic-u-lat-ed through-out so that like a great chest of draw-ers you can open and shut him in all his bony cav-i-ties spread out his ribs like a gi-gan-tic fan and swing all day up-on his low-er jaw Locks are to be put up-on some of his trap doors and shut-ters and a foot-man will show round fu-ture vis-i-tors with a bunch of keys at his side Sir Clif-ford thinks of charg-ing twopence for a peep at the whis-per-ing gallery in the spinal column three-pence to hear the echo in the hol-low of his cere-bel-lum and six-pence for the un-ri-valled view from his fore-head The skele-ton di-men-sions I shall now pro-ceed to set down are copied ver-ba-tim from my right arm where I had them tat-tooed as in my wild wan-der-ings at that pe-ri-od there was no oth-er se-cure way of pre-serv-ing such valu-able statis-tics But as I was crowd-ed for space and wished the oth-er parts of my body to re-main a blank page for a po-em I was then com-pos-ing at least what un-tat-tooed parts might re-main I did not trou-ble my-self with the odd inch-es nor in-deed should inch-es at all en-ter in-to a con-ge-nial ad-mea-sure-ment of the whale CHAPTER 13 Mea-sure-ment of The Whale s Skele-ton In the first place I wish to lay be-fore you a par-tic-u-lar plain state-ment touch-ing the liv-ing bulk of this leviathan whose skele-ton we are briefly to ex-hibit Such a state-ment may prove use-ful here Ac-cord-ing to a care-ful cal-cu-la-tion I have made and which I part-ly base up-on Cap-tain Scores-by s es-ti-mate of sev-en-ty tons for the largest sized Green-land whale of six-ty feet in length ac-cord-ing to my care-ful cal-cu-la-tion I say a Sperm Whale of the largest mag-ni-tude be-tween eighty five and nine-ty feet in length and some-thing less than forty feet in its fullest cir-cum-fer-ence such a whale will weigh at least nine-ty tons so that reck-on-ing thir-teen men to a ton he would con-sid-er-ably out-weigh the com-bined pop-u-la-tion of a whole vil-lage of one thou-sand one hun-dred in-hab-i-tan-ts Think you not then that brains like yoked cat-tle should be put to this leviathan to make him at all budge to any lands-man s imag-i-na-tion Hav-ing al-ready in var-i-ous ways put be-fore you his skull spout hole jaw teeth tail fore-head fins and di-vers oth-er parts I shall now sim-ply point out what is most in-ter-est-ing in the gen-er-al bulk of his un-ob-struct-ed bones But as the colos-sal skull em-braces so very large a pro-por-tion of the en-tire ex-tent of the skele-ton as it is by far the most com-pli-cat-ed part and as noth-ing is to be re-peat-ed con-cern-ing it in this chap-ter you must not fail to car-ry it in your mind or un-der your arm as we pro-ceed oth-er-wise you will not gain a com-plete no-tion of the gen-er-al struc-ture we are about to view In length the Sperm Whale s skele-ton at Tran-que mea-sured sev-en-ty two feet so that when ful-ly in-vest-ed and ex-tend-ed in life he must have been nine-ty feet long for in the whale the skele-ton los-es about one fifth in length com-pared with the liv-ing body Of this sev-en-ty two feet his skull and jaw com-prised some twen-ty feet leav-ing some fifty feet of plain back bone At-tached to this back bone for some-thing less than a third of its length was the mighty cir-cu-lar bas-ket of ribs which on-ce en-closed his vi-tals To me this vast ivory ribbed chest with the long un-re-lieved spine ex-tend-ing far away from it in a straight line not a lit-tle re-sem-bled the hull of a great ship new laid up-on the stocks when on-ly some twen-ty of her naked bow ribs are in-sert-ed and the keel is oth-er-wise for the time but a long dis-con-nect-ed tim-ber The ribs were ten on a side The first to be-gin from the neck was near-ly six feet long the sec-ond third and fourth were each suc-ces-sive-ly longer till you came to the cli-max of the fifth or one of the mid-dle ribs which mea-sured eight feet and some inch-es From that part the re-main-ing ribs di-min-ished till the ten-th and last on-ly spanned five feet and some inch-es In gen-er-al thick-ness they all bore a seem-ly cor-re-spon-dence to their length The mid-dle ribs were the most arched In some of the Ar-sacides they are used for beams where-on to lay foot-path bridges over small streams In con-sid-er-ing the-se ribs I could not but be struck anew with the cir-cum-stance so var-i-ous-ly re-peat-ed in this book that the skele-ton of the whale is by no means the mould of his in-vest-ed form The largest of the Tran-que ribs one of the mid-dle ones oc-cu-pied that part of the fish which in life is great-est in depth Now the great-est depth of the in-vest-ed body of this par-tic-u-lar whale must have been at least six-teen feet where-as the cor-re-spond-ing rib mea-sured but lit-tle more than eight feet So that this rib on-ly con-veyed half of the true no-tion of the liv-ing mag-ni-tude of that part Be-sides for some way where I now saw but a naked spine all that had been on-ce wrapped round with tons of added bulk in flesh mus-cle blood and bow-els Still more for the am-ple fins I here saw but a few dis-or-dered join-ts and in place of the weighty and ma-jes-tic but bone-less flukes an ut-ter blank How vain and fool-ish then thought I for timid un-trav-elled man to try to com-pre-hend aright this won-drous whale by mere-ly por-ing over his dead at-ten-u-at-ed skele-ton stretched in this peace-ful wood No On-ly in the heart of quick-est per-ils on-ly when with-in the ed-dy-ings of his an-gry flukes on-ly on the pro-found un-bound-ed sea can the ful-ly in-vest-ed whale be tru-ly and liv-ing-ly found out But the spine For that the best way we can con-sid-er it is with a crane to pile its bones high up on end No speedy en-ter-prise But now it s done it looks much like Pom-pey s Pil-lar There are forty and odd ver-te-br in all which in the skele-ton are not locked to-geth-er They most-ly lie like the great knobbed blocks on a Goth-ic spire form-ing solid cours-es of heavy ma-son-ry The largest a mid-dle one is in width some-thing less than three feet and in depth more than four The small-est where the spine ta-pers away in-to the tail is on-ly two inch-es in width and looks some-thing like a white bil-liard ball I was told that there were still small-er ones but they had been lost by some lit-tle can-ni-bal urchins the priest s chil-dren who had stolen them to play mar-bles with Thus we see how that the spine of even the hugest of liv-ing things ta-pers off at last in-to sim-ple child s play CHAPTER 14 The Fos-sil Whale From his mighty bulk the whale af-fords a most con-ge-nial the-me where-on to en-large am-pli-fy and gen-er-al-ly ex-pa-ti-ate Would you you could not com-press him By good rights he should on-ly be treat-ed of in im-pe-ri-al fo-lio Not to tell over again his fur-longs from spir-a-cle to tail and the yards he mea-sures about the waist on-ly think of the gi-gan-tic in-vo-lu-tions of his in-testi-nes where they lie in him like great ca-bles and hawsers coiled away in the sub-ter-ranean or-lop deck of a line of bat-tle ship Since I have un-der-tak-en to man-han-dle this Le-viathan it be-hooves me to ap-prove my-self om-ni-scient-ly ex-haus-tive in the en-ter-prise not over-look-ing the min-utest sem-i-nal ger-ms of his blood and spin-ning him out to the ut-ter-most coil of his bow-els Hav-ing al-ready de-scribed him in most of his pre-sent habi-ta-to-ry and anatom-i-cal pe-cu-liar-i-ties it now re-mains to mag-ni-fy him in an arch olog-i-cal fos-sil-if-er-ous and an-te-dilu-vian point of view Ap-plied to any oth-er crea-ture than the Le-viathan to an ant or a flea such port-ly ter-ms might just-ly be deemed un-war-rantably grandil-o-quent But when Le-viathan is the text the case is al-tered Fain am I to stag-ger to this em-prise un-der the weight-i-est words of the dic-tio-nary And here be it said that when-ev-er it has been con-ve-nient to con-sult one in the course of the-se dis-ser-ta-tions I have in-vari-ably used a huge quar-to edi-tion of John-son ex-press-ly pur-chased for that pur-pose be-cause that fa-mous lex-i-cog-ra-pher s un-com-mon per-son-al bulk more fit-ted him to com-pile a lex-i-con to be used by a whale au-thor like me One of-ten hears of writ-ers that rise and swell with their sub-ject though it may seem but an or-di-nary one How then with me writ-ing of this Le-viathan Un-con-scious-ly my chi-rog-ra-phy ex-pands in-to plac-ard cap-i-tals Give me a con-dor s quill Give me Ve-su-vius crater for an ink-stand Friends hold my ar-ms For in the mere act of pen-ning my thoughts of this Le-viathan they weary me and make me faint with their out-reach-ing com-pre-hen-sive-ness of sweep as if to in-clude the whole cir-cle of the sci-ences and all the gen-er-a-tions of whales and men and mastodons past pre-sent and to come with all the re-volv-ing panora-mas of em-pire on earth and through-out the whole uni-verse not ex-clud-ing its sub-ur-bs Such and so mag-ni-fy-ing is the virtue of a large and lib-er-al the-me We ex-pand to its bulk To pro-duce a mighty book you must choose a mighty the-me No great and en-dur-ing vol-ume can ev-er be writ-ten on the flea though many there be who have tried it Ere en-ter-ing up-on the sub-ject of Fos-sil Whales I pre-sent my cre-den-tials as a ge-ol-o-gist by stat-ing that in my mis-cel-la-neous time I have been a stone ma-son and al-so a great dig-ger of ditch-es canals and wells wine vaults cel-lars and cis-terns of all sorts Like-wise by way of pre-lim-i-nary I de-sire to re-mind the read-er that while in the ear-lier ge-o-log-i-cal strata there are found the fos-sils of mon-sters now al-most com-plete-ly ex-tinct the sub-se-quent relics dis-cov-ered in what are called the Ter-tiary for-ma-tions seem the con-nect-ing or at any rate in-ter-cept-ed links be-tween the an-tichron-i-cal crea-tures and those whose re-mote pos-ter-i-ty are said to have en-tered the Ark all the Fos-sil Whales hith-er-to dis-cov-ered be-long to the Ter-tiary pe-ri-od which is the last pre-ced-ing the su-per-fi-cial for-ma-tions And though none of them pre-cise-ly an-swer to any known species of the pre-sent time they are yet suf-fi-cient-ly ak-in to them in gen-er-al re-spec-ts to jus-ti-fy their tak-ing rank as Ce-tacean fos-sils De-tached bro-ken fos-sils of pre adamite whales frag-men-ts of their bones and skele-tons have with-in thir-ty years past at var-i-ous in-ter-vals been found at the base of the Alps in Lom-bardy in France in Eng-land in Scot-land and in the States of Louisiana Mis-sis-sip-pi and Alaba-ma Among the more cu-ri-ous of such re-mains is part of a skull which in the year 1779 was dis-in-terred in the Rue Dauphine in Paris a short street open-ing al-most di-rect-ly up-on the palace of the Tui-leries and bones dis-in-terred in ex-ca-vat-ing the great docks of An-twerp in Napoleon s time Cu-vier pro-nounced the-se frag-men-ts to have be-longed to some ut-ter-ly un-known Le-viathanic species But by far the most won-der-ful of all Ce-tacean relics was the al-most com-plete vast skele-ton of an ex-tinct mon-ster found in the year 1842 on the plan-ta-tion of Judge Creagh in Alaba-ma The awe strick-en cred-u-lous slaves in the vicin-i-ty took it for the bones of one of the fal-l-en an-gels The Alaba-ma doc-tors de-clared it a huge rep-tile and be-stowed up-on it the name of Basilosaurus But some spec-i-men bones of it be-ing tak-en across the sea to Owen the English Anatomist it turned out that this al-leged rep-tile was a whale though of a de-part-ed species A sig-nif-i-cant il-lus-tra-tion of the fact again and again re-peat-ed in this book that the skele-ton of the whale fur-nish-es but lit-tle clue to the shape of his ful-ly in-vest-ed body So Owen rechris-tened the mon-ster Zeu-glodon and in his pa-per read be-fore the Lon-don Ge-o-log-i-cal So-ci-ety pro-nounced it in sub-stance one of the most ex-traor-di-nary crea-tures which the mu-ta-tions of the globe have blot-ted out of ex-is-tence When I stand among the-se mighty Le-viathan skele-tons skul-ls tusks jaws ribs and ver-te-br all char-ac-ter-ized by par-tial re-sem-blances to the ex-ist-ing breeds of sea mon-sters but at the same time bear-ing on the oth-er hand sim-i-lar affini-ties to the an-ni-hi-lat-ed an-tichron-i-cal Le-viathans their in-cal-cu-la-ble se-niors I am by a flood borne back to that won-drous pe-ri-od ere time it-self can be said to have be-gun for time be-gan with man Here Saturn s grey chaos rol-ls over me and I ob-tain dim shud-der-ing glimpses in-to those Po-lar eter-ni-ties when wedged bas-tions of ice pressed hard up-on what are now the Trop-ics and in all the 25  miles of this world s cir-cum-fer-ence not an in-hab-it-able hand s breadth of land was vis-i-ble Then the whole world was the whale s and king of cre-ation he left his wake along the pre-sent lines of the An-des and the Him-male-hs Who can show a pedi-gree like Le-viathan Ahab s har-poon had shed old-er blood than the Pharao-h s Methuse-lah seems a school boy I look round to shake hands with Shem I am hor-ror struck at this an-te-mo-saic un-sourced ex-is-tence of the un-speak-able ter-rors of the whale which hav-ing been be-fore all time must needs ex-ist af-ter all hu-mane ages are over But not alone has this Le-viathan left his pre adamite traces in the stereo-type plates of na-ture and in lime-stone and marl be-queathed his an-cient bust but up-on Egyp-tian tablets whose an-tiq-ui-ty seems to claim for them an al-most fos-sil-if-er-ous char-ac-ter we find the un-mis-tak-able print of his fin In an apart-ment of the great tem-ple of Den-der-ah some fifty years ago there was dis-cov-ered up-on the gran-ite ceil-ing a sculp-tured and paint-ed plani-sphere abound-ing in cen-tau-rs griffins and dol-phins sim-i-lar to the grotesque fig-ures on the ce-les-tial globe of the mod-erns Glid-ing among them old Le-viathan swam as of yore was there swim-ming in that plani-sphere cen-turies be-fore Solomon was cra-dled Nor must there be omit-ted an-oth-er strange at-tes-ta-tion of the an-tiq-ui-ty of the whale in his own os-seous post dilu-vian re-al-i-ty as set down by the ven-er-a-ble John Leo the old Bar-bary trav-eller  Not far from the Sea side they have a Tem-ple the Rafters and Beams of which are made of Whale Bones for Whales of a mon-strous size are of-ten-times cast up dead up-on that shore The Com-mon Peo-ple imag-ine that by a se-cret Pow-er be-stowed by God up-on the Tem-ple no Whale can pass it with-out im-me-di-ate death But the truth of the Mat-ter is that on ei-ther side of the Tem-ple there are Rocks that shoot two Miles in-to the Sea and wound the Whales when they light up-on  em They keep a Whale s Rib of an in-cred-i-ble length for a Mir-a-cle which ly-ing up-on the Ground with its con-vex part up-per-most makes an Arch the Head of which can-not be reached by a Man up-on a Camel s Back This Rib says John Leo is said to have layn there a hun-dred Years be-fore I saw it Their His-to-ri-ans af-firm that a Prophet who proph-esy d of Ma-homet came from this Tem-ple and some do not stand to as-sert that the Prophet Jonas was cast forth by the Whale at the Base of the Tem-ple  In this Afric Tem-ple of the Whale I leave you read-er and if you be a Nan-tuck-eter and a whale-man you will silent-ly wor-ship there CHAPTER 15 Does the Whale s Mag-ni-tude Di-min-ish  Will He Per-ish Inas-much then as this Le-viathan comes floun-der-ing down up-on us from the head wa-ters of the Eter-ni-ties it may be fit-ly in-quired whether in the long course of his gen-er-a-tions he has not de-gen-er-at-ed from the orig-i-nal bulk of his sires But up-on in-ves-ti-ga-tion we find that not on-ly are the whales of the pre-sent day su-pe-ri-or in mag-ni-tude to those whose fos-sil re-mains are found in the Ter-tiary sys-tem em-brac-ing a dis-tinct ge-o-log-i-cal pe-ri-od pri-or to man but of the whales found in that Ter-tiary sys-tem those be-long-ing to its lat-ter for-ma-tions ex-ceed in size those of its ear-lier ones Of all the pre adamite whales yet ex-humed by far the largest is the Alaba-ma one men-tioned in the last chap-ter and that was less than sev-en-ty feet in length in the skele-ton Where-as we have al-ready seen that the tape mea-sure gives sev-en-ty two feet for the skele-ton of a large sized mod-ern whale And I have heard on whale-men s au-thor-i-ty that Sperm Whales have been cap-tured near a hun-dred feet long at the time of cap-ture But may it not be that while the whales of the pre-sent hour are an ad-vance in mag-ni-tude up-on those of all pre-vi-ous ge-o-log-i-cal pe-ri-ods may it not be that since Adam s time they have de-gen-er-at-ed As-sured-ly we must con-clude so if we are to cred-it the ac-coun-ts of such gen-tle-men as Pliny and the an-cient nat-u-ral-ists gen-er-al-ly For Pliny tel-ls us of whales that em-braced acres of liv-ing bulk and Al-drovan-dus of oth-ers which mea-sured eight hun-dred feet in length Rope Walks and Thames Tun-nels of Whales And even in the days of Banks and Solan-der Cooke s nat-u-ral-ists we find a Dan-ish mem-ber of the Acade-my of Sciences set-ting down cer-tain Ice-land Whales rey-dan siskur or Wrin-kled Bel-lies at one hun-dred and twen-ty yards that is three hun-dred and six-ty feet And Lac p de the French nat-u-ral-ist in his elab-o-rate his-to-ry of whales in the very be-gin-ning of his work page 3 sets down the Right Whale at one hun-dred me-tres three hun-dred and twen-ty eight feet And this work was pub-lished so late as A D 1825 But will any whale-man be-lieve the-se sto-ries No The whale of to day is as big as his an-ces-tors in Pliny s time And if ev-er I go where Pliny is I a whale-man more than he was will make bold to tell him so Be-cause I can-not un-der-stand how it is that while the Egyp-tian mum-mies that were buried thou-sands of years be-fore even Pliny was born do not mea-sure so much in their coffins as a mod-ern Ken-tuck-ian in his socks and while the cat-tle and oth-er an-i-mals sculp-tured on the old-est Egyp-tian and Nin-eveh tablets by the rel-a-tive pro-por-tions in which they are drawn just as plain-ly prove that the high bred stall fed prize cat-tle of Smith-field not on-ly equal but far ex-ceed in mag-ni-tude the fat-test of Pharao-h s fat kine in the face of all this I will not ad-mit that of all an-i-mals the whale alone should have de-gen-er-at-ed But still an-oth-er in-quiry re-mains one of-ten ag-i-tat-ed by the more re-con-dite Nan-tuck-eters Whether ow-ing to the al-most om-ni-scient look outs at the mast heads of the whale ships now pen-e-trat-ing even through Behring s straits and in-to the re-motest se-cret draw-ers and lock-ers of the world and the thou-sand har-poons and lances dart-ed along all con-ti-nen-tal coasts the moot point is whether Le-viathan can long en-dure so wide a chase and so re-morse-less a hav-oc whether he must not at last be ex-ter-mi-nat-ed from the wa-ters and the last whale like the last man smoke his last pipe and then him-self evap-o-rate in the fi-nal puff Com-par-ing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buf-falo which not forty years ago over-spread by tens of thou-sands the prairies of Illi-nois and Mis-souri and shook their iron manes and scowled with their thun-der clot-ted brows up-on the sites of pop-u-lous river cap-i-tals where now the po-lite bro-ker sel-ls you land at a dol-lar an inch in such a com-par-ison an ir-re-sistible ar-gu-ment would seem fur-nished to show that the hunt-ed whale can-not now es-cape speedy ex-tinc-tion But you must look at this mat-ter in ev-ery light Though so short a pe-ri-od ago not a good life-time the cen-sus of the buf-falo in Illi-nois ex-ceed-ed the cen-sus of men now in Lon-don and though at the pre-sent day not one horn or hoof of them re-mains in all that re-gion and though the cause of this won-drous ex-ter-mi-na-tion was the spear of man yet the far dif-fer-ent na-ture of the whale hunt peremp-to-ri-ly for-bids so in-glo-ri-ous an end to the Le-viathan Forty men in one ship hunt-ing the Sperm Whales for forty eight months think they have done ex-treme-ly well and thank God if at last they car-ry home the oil of forty fish Where-as in the days of the old Cana-di-an and In-di-an hunters and trap-pers of the West when the far west in whose sun-set suns still rise was a wilder-ness and a vir-gin the same num-ber of moc-casined men for the same num-ber of months mount-ed on horse in-stead of sail-ing in ships would have slain not forty but forty thou-sand and more buf-faloes a fact that if need were could be sta-tis-ti-cal-ly stat-ed Nor con-sid-ered aright does it seem any ar-gu-ment in favour of the grad-u-al ex-tinc-tion of the Sperm Whale for ex-am-ple that in for-mer years the lat-ter part of the last cen-tu-ry say the-se Le-viathans in small pods were en-coun-tered much of-ten-er than at pre-sent and in con-se-quence the voy-ages were not so pro-longed and were al-so much more re-mu-ner-a-tive Be-cause as has been else-where no-ticed those whales in-flu-enced by some views to safe-ty now swim the seas in im-mense car-a-vans so that to a large de-gree the scat-tered soli-taries yokes and pods and schools of oth-er days are now ag-gre-gat-ed in-to vast but wide-ly sep-a-rat-ed un-fre-quent armies That is all And equal-ly fal-la-cious seems the con-ceit that be-cause the so called whale bone whales no longer haunt many grounds in for-mer years abound-ing with them hence that species al-so is de-clin-ing For they are on-ly be-ing driven from promon-to-ry to cape and if one coast is no longer en-livened with their jets then be sure some oth-er and re-moter strand has been very re-cent-ly star-tled by the un-fa-mil-iar spec-ta-cle Fur-ther-more con-cern-ing the-se last men-tioned Le-viathans they have two firm fortress-es which in all hu-man prob-a-bil-i-ty will for ev-er re-main im-preg-nable And as up-on the in-va-sion of their val-leys the frosty Swiss have re-treat-ed to their moun-tains so hunt-ed from the sa-van-nas and glades of the mid-dle seas the whale bone whales can at last re-sort to their Po-lar citadels and div-ing un-der the ul-ti-mate glassy bar-ri-ers and wal-ls there come up among icy fields and floes and in a charmed cir-cle of ev-er-last-ing De-cem-ber bid de-fi-ance to all pur-suit from man But as per-haps fifty of the-se whale bone whales are har-pooned for one cachalot some philoso-phers of the fore-castle have con-clud-ed that this pos-i-tive hav-oc has al-ready very se-ri-ous-ly di-min-ished their bat-tal-ions But though for some time past a num-ber of the-se whales not less than 13  have been an-nu-al-ly slain on the nor west coast by the Amer-i-cans alone yet there are con-sid-er-a-tions which ren-der even this cir-cum-stance of lit-tle or no ac-count as an op-pos-ing ar-gu-ment in this mat-ter Nat-u-ral as it is to be some-what in-cred-u-lous con-cern-ing the pop-u-lous-ness of the more enor-mous crea-tures of the globe yet what shall we say to Har-to the his-to-ri-an of Goa when he tel-ls us that at one hunt-ing the King of Si-am took 4  ele-phan-ts that in those re-gions ele-phan-ts are nu-mer-ous as droves of cat-tle in the tem-per-ate climes And there seems no rea-son to doubt that if the-se ele-phan-ts which have now been hunt-ed for thou-sands of years by Semi-ramis by Porus by Han-ni-bal and by all the suc-ces-sive monar-chs of the East if they still sur-vive there in great num-bers much more may the great whale out-last all hunt-ing since he has a pas-ture to ex-pa-ti-ate in which is pre-cise-ly twice as large as all Asia both Amer-i-c-as Europe and Africa New Hol-land and all the Isles of the sea com-bined More-over we are to con-sid-er that from the pre-sumed great longevi-ty of whales their prob-a-bly at-tain-ing the age of a cen-tu-ry and more there-fore at any one pe-ri-od of time sev-er-al dis-tinct adult gen-er-a-tions must be con-tem-po-rary And what that is we may soon gain some idea of by imag-in-ing all the grave yards ceme-ter-ies and fam-i-ly vaults of cre-ation yield-ing up the live bod-ies of all the men wom-en and chil-dren who were alive sev-en-ty five years ago and adding this count-less host to the pre-sent hu-man pop-u-la-tion of the globe Where-fore for all the-se things we ac-count the whale im-mor-tal in his species how-ev-er per-ish-able in his in-di-vid-u-al-i-ty He swam the seas be-fore the con-ti-nen-ts broke wa-ter he on-ce swam over the site of the Tui-leries and Wind-sor Castle and the Krem-lin In Noah s flood he de-spised Noah s Ark and if ev-er the world is to be again flood-ed like the Nether-lands to kill off its rats then the eter-nal whale will still sur-vive and rear-ing up-on the top-most crest of the equa-to-ri-al flood spout his frothed de-fi-ance to the skies CHAPTER 16 Ahab s Leg The pre-cip-i-tat-ing man-ner in which Cap-tain Ahab had quit-ted the Sa-muel En-der-by of Lon-don had not been unat-tend-ed with some small vi-o-lence to his own per-son He had light-ed with such en-er-gy up-on a thwart of his boat that his ivory leg had re-ceived a half splin-ter-ing shock And when af-ter gain-ing his own deck and his own piv-ot hole there he so ve-he-ment-ly wheeled round with an ur-gent com-mand to the steers-man it was as ev-er some-thing about his not steer-ing in-flex-i-bly enough then the al-ready shak-en ivory re-ceived such an ad-di-tion-al twist and wrench that though it still re-mained en-tire and to all ap-pear-ances lusty yet Ahab did not deem it en-tire-ly trust-wor-thy And in-deed it seemed small mat-ter for won-der that for all his per-vad-ing mad reck-less-ness Ahab did at times give care-ful heed to the con-di-tion of that dead bone up-on which he part-ly stood For it had not been very long pri-or to the Pe-quod s sail-ing from Nan-tuck-et that he had been found one night ly-ing prone up-on the ground and in-sen-si-ble by some un-known and seem-ing-ly in-ex-pli-ca-ble unimag-in-able ca-su-al-ty his ivory limb hav-ing been so vi-o-lent-ly dis-placed that it had stake wise smit-ten and all but pierced his groin nor was it with-out ex-treme dif-fi-cul-ty that the ag-o-niz-ing wound was en-tire-ly cured Nor at the time had it failed to en-ter his mono-ma-ni-ac mind that all the an-guish of that then pre-sent suf-fer-ing was but the di-rect is-sue of a for-mer woe and he too plain-ly seemed to see that as the most poi-sonous rep-tile of the marsh per-pet-u-ates his kind as in-evitably as the sweet-est song-ster of the grove so equal-ly with ev-ery fe-lic-i-ty all mis-er-able even-ts do nat-u-ral-ly beget their like Yea more than equal-ly thought Ahab since both the an-ces-try and pos-ter-i-ty of Grief go fur-ther than the an-ces-try and pos-ter-i-ty of Joy For not to hint of this that it is an in-fer-ence from cer-tain canon-ic teach-ings that while some nat-u-ral en-joy-men-ts here shall have no chil-dren born to them for the oth-er world but on the con-trary shall be fol-lowed by the joy child-less-ness of all hel-l s de-spair where-as some guilty mor-tal mis-eries shall still fer-tile-ly beget to them-selves an eter-nal-ly pro-gres-sive progeny of griefs be-yond the grave not at all to hint of this there still seems an in-equal-i-ty in the deep-er anal-y-sis of the thing For thought Ahab while even the high-est earth-ly fe-lic-i-ties ev-er have a cer-tain un-signi-fy-ing pet-ti-ness lurk-ing in them but at bot-tom all heart-woes a mys-tic sig-nif-i-cance and in some men an archangelic grandeur so do their dili-gent trac-ings out not be-lie the ob-vi-ous de-duc-tion To trail the ge-nealo-gies of the-se high mor-tal mis-eries car-ries us at last among the source-less pri-mo-gen-i-tures of the gods so that in the face of all the glad hay mak-ing suns and soft cym-balling round har-vest moons we must needs give in to this that the gods them-selves are not for ev-er glad The in-ef-face-able sad birth mark in the brow of man is but the stamp of sor-row in the sign-ers Un-wit-ting-ly here a se-cret has been di-vulged which per-haps might more prop-er-ly in set way have been dis-closed be-fore With many oth-er par-tic-u-lars con-cern-ing Ahab al-ways had it re-mained a mys-tery to some why it was that for a cer-tain pe-ri-od both be-fore and af-ter the sail-ing of the Pe-quod he had hid-den him-self away with such Grand La-ma like ex-clu-sive-ness and for that one in-ter-val sought speech-less refuge as it were among the mar-ble sen-ate of the dead Cap-tain Peleg s bruit-ed rea-son for this thing ap-peared by no means ad-e-quate though in-deed as touch-ing all Ahab s deep-er part ev-ery rev-e-la-tion par-took more of sig-nif-i-cant dark-ness than of ex-plana-to-ry light But in the end it all came out this one mat-ter did at least That dire-ful mishap was at the bot-tom of his tem-po-rary recluse-ness And not on-ly this but to that ev-er con-tract-ing drop-ping cir-cle ashore who for any rea-son pos-sessed the priv-i-lege of a less banned ap-proach to him to that timid cir-cle the above hint-ed ca-su-al-ty re-main-ing as it did mood-i-ly un-ac-count-ed for by Ahab in-vest-ed it-self with ter-rors not en-tire-ly un-der-ived from the land of spir-its and of wails So that through their zeal for him they had all con-spired so far as in them lay to muf-fle up the knowl-edge of this thing from oth-ers and hence it was that not till a con-sid-er-able in-ter-val had elapsed did it tran-spire up-on the Pe-quod s decks But be all this as it may let the un-seen am-bigu-ous syn-od in the air or the vin-dic-tive princes and po-ten-tates of fire have to do or not with earth-ly Ahab yet in this pre-sent mat-ter of his leg he took plain prac-ti-cal pro-ce-dures  he called the car-pen-ter And when that func-tionary ap-peared be-fore him he bade him with-out de-lay set about mak-ing a new leg and di-rect-ed the mates to see him sup-plied with all the studs and joists of jaw ivory Sperm Whale which had thus far been ac-cu-mu-lat-ed on the voy-age in or-der that a care-ful se-lec-tion of the stoutest clear-est grained stuff might be se-cured This done the car-pen-ter re-ceived or-ders to have the leg com-plet-ed that night and to provide all the fit-tings for it in-de-pen-dent of those per-tain-ing to the dis-trust-ed one in use More-over the ship s forge was or-dered to be hoist-ed out of its tem-po-rary idle-ness in the hold and to ac-cel-er-ate the af-fair the black-smith was com-mand-ed to pro-ceed at on-ce to the forg-ing of what-ev-er iron con-trivances might be need-ed CHAPTER 17 The Car-pen-ter Seat thy-self sul-tan-i-cal-ly among the moons of Saturn and take high ab-stract-ed man alone and he seems a won-der a grandeur and a woe But from the same point take mankind in mass and for the most part they seem a mob of un-nec-es-sary du-pli-cates both con-tem-po-rary and hered-i-tary But most hum-ble though he was and far from fur-nish-ing an ex-am-ple of the high hu-mane ab-strac-tion the Pe-quod s car-pen-ter was no du-pli-cate hence he now comes in per-son on this stage Like all sea go-ing ship car-pen-ters and more es-pe-cial-ly those be-long-ing to whal-ing ves-sels he was to a cer-tain off hand-ed prac-ti-cal ex-tent alike ex-pe-ri-enced in nu-mer-ous trades and call-ings col-lat-er-al to his own the car-pen-ter s pur-suit be-ing the an-cient and out-branch-ing trunk of all those nu-mer-ous hand-i-crafts which more or less have to do with wood as an aux-il-iary ma-te-ri-al But be-sides the ap-pli-ca-tion to him of the gener-ic re-mark above this car-pen-ter of the Pe-quod was sin-gu-lar-ly ef-fi-cient in those thou-sand name-less me-chan-i-cal emer-gen-cies con-tin-u-al-ly re-cur-ring in a large ship up-on a three or four years voy-age in un-civ-i-lized and far dis-tant seas For not to speak of his readi-ness in or-di-nary du-ties  re-pair-ing stove boats sprung spars re-form-ing the shape of clum-sy blad-ed oars in-sert-ing bul-l s eyes in the deck or new tree nails in the side planks and oth-er mis-cel-la-neous mat-ters more di-rect-ly per-tain-ing to his spe-cial busi-ness he was more-over un-hesi-tat-ing-ly ex-pert in all man-ner of con-flict-ing ap-ti-tudes both use-ful and capri-cious The one grand stage where he en-act-ed all his var-i-ous parts so man-i-fold was his vice bench a long rude pon-der-ous table fur-nished with sev-er-al vices of dif-fer-ent sizes and both of iron and of wood At all times ex-cept when whales were alongside this bench was se-cure-ly lashed athwartships again-st the rear of the Try works A be-lay-ing pin is found too large to be eas-i-ly in-sert-ed in-to its hole the car-pen-ter claps it in-to one of his ev-er ready vices and straight-way files it small-er A lost land bird of strange plumage strays on board and is made a cap-tive out of clean shaved rods of right whale bone and cross beams of sperm whale ivory the car-pen-ter makes a pago-da look-ing cage for it An oars-man sprains his wrist the car-pen-ter con-coc-ts a sooth-ing lo-tion Stubb longed for ver-mil-lion stars to be paint-ed up-on the blade of his ev-ery oar screw-ing each oar in his big vice of wood the car-pen-ter sym-met-ri-cal-ly sup-plies the con-stel-la-tion A sailor takes a fan-cy to wear shark bone ear rings the car-pen-ter drills his ears Another has the toothache the car-pen-ter out pin-cers and clap-ping one hand up-on his bench bids him be seat-ed there but the poor fel-low un-man-age-ably winces un-der the un-con-clud-ed op-er-a-tion whirling round the han-dle of his wood-en vice the car-pen-ter signs him to clap his jaw in that if he would have him draw the tooth Thus this car-pen-ter was pre-pared at all points and alike in-dif-fer-ent and with-out re-spect in all Teeth he ac-count-ed bits of ivory heads he deemed but top blocks men them-selves he light-ly held for cap-stans But while now up-on so wide a field thus var-i-ous-ly ac-com-plished and with such live-li-ness of ex-pert-ness in him too all this would seem to ar-gue some un-com-mon vi-vac-i-ty of in-tel-li-gence But not pre-cise-ly so For noth-ing was this man more re-mark-able than for a cer-tain im-per-son-al sto-lid-i-ty as it were im-per-son-al I say for it so shad-ed off in-to the sur-round-ing in-finite of things that it seemed one with the gen-er-al sto-lid-i-ty dis-cernible in the whole vis-i-ble world which while pause-less-ly ac-tive in un-count-ed mod-es still eter-nal-ly holds its peace and ig-nores you though you dig foun-da-tions for cathe-drals Yet was this half hor-ri-ble sto-lid-i-ty in him in-volv-ing too as it ap-peared an all ram-i-fy-ing heart-less-ness  yet was it odd-ly dashed at times with an old crutch like an-te-dilu-vian wheez-ing hu-mor-ous-ness not un-streaked now and then with a cer-tain griz-zled wit-ti-ness such as might have served to pass the time dur-ing the mid-night watch on the beard-ed fore-castle of Noah s ark Was it that this old car-pen-ter had been a life long wan-derer whose much rolling to and fro not on-ly had gath-ered no moss but what is more had rubbed off what-ev-er small out-ward cling-ings might have orig-i-nal-ly per-tained to him He was a stript ab-stract an un-frac-tioned in-te-gral un-com-pro-mised as a new born babe liv-ing with-out pre-med-i-tat-ed ref-er-ence to this world or the next You might al-most say that this strange un-com-pro-mised-ness in him in-volved a sort of un-in-tel-li-gence for in his nu-mer-ous trades he did not seem to work so much by rea-son or by in-stinct or sim-ply be-cause he had been tu-tored to it or by any in-ter-mix-ture of all the-se even or un-even but mere-ly by a kind of deaf and dumb spon-ta-neous lit-er-al pro-cess He was a pure ma-nip-u-la-tor his brain if he had ev-er had one must have ear-ly oozed along in-to the mus-cles of his fin-gers He was like one of those un-rea-son-ing but still high-ly use-ful mul-tum in par-vo Sh-effield con-trivances as-sum-ing the ex-te-ri-or though a lit-tle swelled of a com-mon pock-et knife but con-tain-ing not on-ly blades of var-i-ous sizes but al-so screw drivers cork screws tweez-ers awls pens rulers nail fil-ers coun-ter-sinkers So if his su-pe-ri-ors want-ed to use the car-pen-ter for a screw driver all they had to do was to open that part of him and the screw was fast or if for tweez-ers take him up by the legs and there they were Yet as pre-vi-ous-ly hint-ed this om-ni-tooled open and shut car-pen-ter was af-ter all no mere ma-chine of an au-toma-ton If he did not have a com-mon soul in him he had a sub-tle some-thing that some-how anoma-lous-ly did its du-ty What that was whether essence of quick-sil-ver or a few drops of hartshorn there is no telling But there it was and there it had abid-ed for now some six-ty years or more And this it was this same un-ac-count-able cun-ning life prin-ci-ple in him this it was that kept him a great part of the time so-lil-o-quiz-ing but on-ly like an un-rea-son-ing wheel which al-so hum-m-ing-ly so-lil-o-quizes or rather his body was a sen-try box and this so-lil-o-quiz-er on guard there and talk-ing all the time to keep him-self awake CHAPTER 18 Ahab and the Car-pen-ter The Deck First Night Watch Car-pen-ter stand-ing be-fore his vice bench and by the light of two lanterns busi-ly fil-ing the ivory joist for the leg which joist is firm-ly fixed in the vice Slabs of ivory leather straps pads screws and var-i-ous tools of all sorts ly-ing about the bench For-ward the red flame of the forge is seen where the black-smith is at work Drat the file and drat the bone That is hard which should be soft and that is soft which should be hard So we go who file old jaws and shin-bones Let s try an-oth-er Aye now this works bet-ter sneezes Hal-loa this bone dust is sneezes  why it s sneezes  yes it s sneezes  bless my soul it won t let me speak This is what an old fel-low gets now for work-ing in dead lum-ber Saw a live tree and you don t get this dust am-pu-tate a live bone and you don t get it sneezes Come come you old Smut there bear a hand and let s have that fer-ule and buck-le screw I ll be ready for them present-ly Lucky now sneezes there s no knee joint to make that might puz-zle a lit-tle but a mere shin-bone why it s easy as mak-ing hop poles on-ly I should like to put a good fin-ish on Time time if I but on-ly had the time I could turn him out as neat a leg now as ev-er sneezes scraped to a la-dy in a par-lor Those buck-skin legs and calves of legs I ve seen in shop win-dows would-n t com-pare at all They soak wa-ter they do and of course get rheumat-ic and have to be doc-tored sneezes with wash-es and lo-tions just like live legs There be-fore I saw it off now I must call his old Mogul-ship and see whether the length will be all right too short if any-thing I guess Ha that s the heel we are in luck here he comes or it s some-body else that s cer-tain AHAB ad-vanc-ing Dur-ing the en-su-ing scene the car-pen-ter con-tin-ues sneez-ing at times Well man-mak-er Just in time sir If the cap-tain pleas-es I will now mark the length Let me mea-sure sir Mea-sured for a leg good Well it s not the first time About it There keep thy fin-ger on it This is a co-gent vice thou hast here car-pen-ter let me feel its grip on-ce So so it does pinch some Oh sir it will break bones be-ware be-ware No fear I like a good grip I like to feel some-thing in this slip-pery world that can hold man What s Prometheus about there  the black-smith I mean what s he about He must be forg-ing the buck-le screw sir now Right It s a part-ner-ship he sup-plies the mus-cle part He makes a fierce red flame there Aye sir he must have the white heat for this kind of fine work Um m So he must I do deem it now a most mean-ing thing that that old Greek Prometheus who made men they say should have been a black-smith and an-i-mat-ed them with fire for what s made in fire must prop-er-ly be-long to fire and so hel-l s prob-a-ble How the soot flies This must be the re-main-der the Greek made the Africans of Car-pen-ter when he s through with that buck-le tell him to forge a pair of steel shoul-der blades there s a ped-lar aboard with a crush-ing pack Sir Hold while Prometheus is about it I ll or-der a com-plete man af-ter a de-sir-able pat-tern Im-prim-is fifty feet high in his socks then chest mod-elled af-ter the Thames Tun-nel then legs with roots to  em to stay in one place then ar-ms three feet through the wrist no heart at all brass fore-head and about a quar-ter of an acre of fine brains and let me see shall I or-der eyes to see out-wards No but put a sky light on top of his head to il-lu-mi-nate in-wards There take the or-der and away Now what s he speak-ing about and who s he speak-ing to I should like to know Shall I keep stand-ing here aside  Tis but in-dif-fer-ent ar-chi-tec-ture to make a blind dome here s one No no no I must have a lantern Ho ho That s it hey Here are two sir one will serve my turn What art thou thrust-ing that thief catcher in-to my face for man Thrust-ed light is worse than pre-sent-ed pis-tols I thought sir that you spoke to car-pen-ter Car-pen-ter why that s but no  a very tidy and I may say an ex-treme-ly gen-tle-man-like sort of busi-ness thou art in here car-pen-ter  or would st thou rather work in clay Sir  Clay clay sir That s mud we leave clay to ditch-ers sir The fel-low s im-pi-ous What art thou sneez-ing about Bone is rather dusty sir Take the hint then and when thou art dead nev-er bury thy-self un-der liv-ing peo-ple s noses Sir  oh ah  I guess so  yes oh dear Look ye car-pen-ter I dare say thou callest thy-self a right good work-man-like work-man eh Well then will it speak thor-ough-ly well for thy work if when I come to mount this leg thou makest I shall nev-er-the-less feel an-oth-er leg in the same iden-ti-cal place with it that is car-pen-ter my old lost leg the flesh and blood one I mean Canst thou not drive that old Adam away Tru-ly sir I be-gin to un-der-stand some-what now Yes I have heard some-thing cu-ri-ous on that score sir how that a dis-mast-ed man nev-er en-tire-ly los-es the feel-ing of his old spar but it will be still prick-ing him at times May I humbly ask if it be re-al-ly so sir It is man Look put thy live leg here in the place where mine on-ce was so now here is on-ly one dis-tinct leg to the eye yet two to the soul Where thou fee-lest tin-gling life there ex-act-ly there there to a hair do I Is t a rid-dle I should humbly call it a poser sir Hist then How dost thou know that some en-tire liv-ing think-ing thing may not be in-vis-i-bly and un-in-ter-pen-e-trat-ing-ly stand-ing pre-cise-ly where thou now standest aye and stand-ing there in thy spite In thy most soli-tary hours then dost thou not fear eaves-drop-pers Hold don t speak And if I still feel the smart of my crushed leg though it be now so long dis-solved then why mayst not thou car-pen-ter feel the fiery pains of hell for ev-er and with-out a body Hah Good Lord Tru-ly sir if it comes to that I must cal-cu-late over again I think I did-n t car-ry a small fig-ure sir Look ye pud-ding heads should nev-er grant premis-es  How long be-fore the leg is done Per-haps an hour sir Bun-gle away at it then and bring it to me turns to go Oh Life Here I am proud as Greek god and yet stand-ing debtor to this block-head for a bone to stand on Cursed be that mor-tal in-ter in-debt-ed-ness which will not do away with ledgers I would be free as air and I m down in the whole world s books I am so rich I could have given bid for bid with the wealth-i-est Pr to-ri-ans at the auc-tion of the Ro-man em-pire which was the world s and yet I owe for the flesh in the tongue I brag with By heav-ens I ll get a cru-cible and in-to it and dis-solve my-self down to one small com-pen-dious ver-te-bra So CARPENTER re-sum-ing his work Well well well Stubb knows him best of all and Stubb al-ways says he s queer says noth-ing but that one suf-fi-cient lit-tle word queer he s queer says Stubb he s queer queer queer and keeps din-ning it in-to Mr Star-buck all the time queer sir queer queer very queer And here s his leg Yes now that I think of it here s his bed-fel-low has a stick of whale s jaw bone for a wife And this is his leg he ll stand on this What was that now about one leg stand-ing in three places and all three places stand-ing in one hel-l how was that Oh I don t won-der he looked so scorn-ful at me I m a sort of strange thought-ed some-times they say but that s on-ly hap-haz-ard like Then a short lit-tle old body like me should nev-er un-der-take to wade out in-to deep wa-ters with tall heron built cap-tains the wa-ter chucks you un-der the chin pret-ty quick and there s a great cry for life boats And here s the heron s leg long and slim sure enough Now for most folks one pair of legs lasts a life-time and that must be be-cause they use them mer-ci-ful-ly as a ten-der heart-ed old la-dy us-es her roly poly old coach hors-es But Ahab oh he s a hard driver Look driven one leg to death and spavined the oth-er for life and now wears out bone legs by the cord Hal-loa there you Smut bear a hand there with those screws and let s fin-ish it be-fore the res-ur-rec-tion fel-low comes a call-ing with his horn for all legs true or false as brew-ery men go round col-lect-ing old beer bar-rels to fill  em up again What a leg this is It looks like a re-al live leg filed down to noth-ing but the core he ll be stand-ing on this to mor-row he ll be tak-ing al-ti-tudes on it Hal-loa I al-most for-got the lit-tle oval slate smoothed ivory where he fig-ures up the lat-i-tude So so chis-el file and sand pa-per now CHAPTER 19 Ahab and Star-buck in the Cabin Ac-cord-ing to us-age they were pump-ing the ship next morn-ing and lo no in-con-sid-er-able oil came up with the wa-ter the casks be-low must have sprung a bad leak Much con-cern was shown and Star-buck went down in-to the cab-in to re-port this un-favourable af-fair In Sperm whale-men with any con-sid-er-able quan-ti-ty of oil on board it is a reg-u-lar semi week-ly du-ty to con-duct a hose in-to the hold and drench the casks with sea wa-ter which af-ter-wards at vary-ing in-ter-vals is re-moved by the ship s pumps Here-by the casks are sought to be kept damply tight while by the changed char-ac-ter of the with-drawn wa-ter the mariners read-i-ly de-tect any se-ri-ous leak-age in the pre-cious car-go Now from the South and West the Pe-quod was draw-ing nigh to For-mosa and the Bashee Isles be-tween which lies one of the trop-i-cal out-lets from the Chi-na wa-ters in-to the Paci-fic And so Star-buck found Ahab with a gen-er-al chart of the ori-en-tal archipela-goes spread be-fore him and an-oth-er sep-a-rate one rep-re-sent-ing the long east-ern coasts of the Ja-pane-se is-land-s Niphon Mats-mai and Sikoke With his snow white new ivory leg braced again-st the screwed leg of his table and with a long prun-ing hook of a jack knife in his hand the won-drous old man with his back to the gang-way door was wrin-kling his brow and trac-ing his old cours-es again  Who s there  hear-ing the foot-step at the door but not turn-ing round to it  On deck Be-gone   Cap-tain Ahab mis-takes it is I The oil in the hold is leak-ing sir We must up Bur-tons and break out   Up Bur-tons and break out Now that we are near-ing Ja-pan heave to here for a week to tin-ker a parcel of old hoops   Either do that sir or waste in one day more oil than we may make good in a year What we come twen-ty thou-sand miles to get is worth sav-ing sir   So it is so it is if we get it   I was speak-ing of the oil in the hold sir   And I was not speak-ing or think-ing of that at all Be-gone Let it leak I m all aleak my-self Aye leaks in leaks not on-ly full of leaky casks but those leaky casks are in a leaky ship and that s a far worse plight than the Pe-quod s man Yet I don t stop to plug my leak for who can find it in the deep load-ed hull or how hope to plug it even if found in this life s howl-ing gale Star-buck I ll not have the Bur-tons hoist-ed   What will the own-ers say sir   Let the own-ers stand on Nan-tuck-et beach and out-yell the Typhoons What cares Ahab Own-ers own-ers Thou art al-ways prat-ing to me Star-buck about those miser-ly own-ers as if the own-ers were my con-science But look ye the on-ly re-al own-er of any-thing is its com-man-der and hark ye my con-science is in this ship s keel  On deck   Cap-tain Ahab  said the red-den-ing mate mov-ing fur-ther in-to the cab-in with a dar-ing so strange-ly re-spect-ful and cau-tious that it al-most seemed not on-ly ev-ery way seek-ing to avoid the slight-est out-ward man-i-fes-ta-tion of it-self but with-in al-so seemed more than half dis-trust-ful of it-self  A bet-ter man than I might well pass over in thee what he would quick-ly enough re-sent in a younger man aye and in a hap-pier Cap-tain Ahab   Devils Dost thou then so much as dare to crit-i-cal-ly think of me  On deck   Nay sir not yet I do en-treat And I do dare sir to be for-bear-ing Shall we not un-der-stand each oth-er bet-ter than hith-er-to Cap-tain Ahab  Ahab seized a load-ed mus-ket from the rack form-ing part of most South Sea men s cab-in fur-ni-ture and point-ing it to-wards Star-buck ex-claimed  There is one God that is Lord over the earth and one Cap-tain that is lord over the Pe-quod  On deck  For an in-stant in the flash-ing eyes of the mate and his fiery cheeks you would have al-most thought that he had re-al-ly re-ceived the blaze of the lev-elled tube But mas-ter-ing his emo-tion he half calm-ly rose and as he quit-ted the cab-in paused for an in-stant and said  Thou hast out-raged not in-sult-ed me sir but for that I ask thee not to be-ware of Star-buck thou would-st but laugh but let Ahab be-ware of Ahab be-ware of thy-self old man   He wax-es brave but nev-er-the-less obeys most care-ful brav-ery that  mur-mured Ahab as Star-buck dis-ap-peared  What s that he said Ahab be-ware of Ahab there s some-thing there  Then un-con-scious-ly us-ing the mus-ket for a staff with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the lit-tle cab-in but present-ly the thick plaits of his fore-head re-laxed and re-turn-ing the gun to the rack he went to the deck  Thou art but too good a fel-low Star-buck  he said low-ly to the mate then rais-ing his voice to the crew  Furl the t gal-lant sails and close reef the top sails fore and aft back the main yard up Bur-ton and break out in the main hold  It were per-haps vain to sur-mise ex-act-ly why it was that as re-spect-ing Star-buck Ahab thus act-ed It may have been a flash of hon-esty in him or mere pru-den-tial pol-i-cy which un-der the cir-cum-stance im-pe-ri-ous-ly for-bade the slight-est symp-tom of open dis-af-fec-tion how-ev-er tran-sient in the im-por-tant chief of-fi-cer of his ship How-ev-er it was his or-ders were ex-e-cut-ed and the Bur-tons were hoist-ed CHAPTER 11 Quee-queg in His Coffin Upon search-ing it was found that the casks last struck in-to the hold were per-fect-ly sound and that the leak must be fur-ther off So it be-ing calm weath-er they broke out deep-er and deep-er dis-turbing the slum-bers of the huge ground tier but-ts and from that black mid-night send-ing those gi-gan-tic moles in-to the day-light above So deep did they go and so an-cient and cor-rod-ed and weedy the as-pect of the low-er-most pun-cheons that you al-most looked next for some mouldy cor-ner stone cask con-tain-ing coins of Cap-tain Noah with copies of the post-ed plac-ards vain-ly warn-ing the in-fat-u-at-ed old world from the flood Tierce af-ter tierce too of wa-ter and bread and beef and shooks of staves and iron bundles of hoops were hoist-ed out till at last the piled decks were hard to get about and the hol-low hull echoed un-der foot as if you were tread-ing over emp-ty cat-a-com-bs and reeled and rolled in the sea like an air freight-ed demi-john Top heavy was the ship as a din-ner-less stu-dent with all Aris-totle in his head Well was it that the Typhoons did not vis-it them then Now at this time it was that my poor pa-gan com-pan-ion and fast bo-som friend Quee-queg was seized with a fever which brought him nigh to his end-less end Be it said that in this vo-ca-tion of whal-ing sinecures are un-known dig-ni-ty and dan-ger go hand in hand till you get to be Cap-tain the high-er you rise the hard-er you toil So with poor Quee-queg who as har-pooneer must not on-ly face all the rage of the liv-ing whale but as we have else-where seen mount his dead back in a rolling sea and fi-nal-ly de-scend in-to the gloom of the hold and bit-ter-ly sweat-ing all day in that sub-ter-ra-ne-ous con-fine-ment res-o-lute-ly man-han-dle the clum-si-est casks and see to their stowage To be short among whale-men the har-pooneers are the hold-ers so called Poor Quee-queg when the ship was about half dis-em-bow-elled you should have stooped over the hatch-way and peered down up-on him there where stripped to his wool-len draw-ers the tat-tooed sav-age was crawl-ing about amid that damp-ness and slime like a green spot-ted lizard at the bot-tom of a well And a well or an ice house it some-how proved to him poor pa-gan where strange to say for all the heat of his sweat-ings he caught a ter-ri-ble chill which lapsed in-to a fever and at last af-ter some days suf-fer-ing laid him in his ham-mock close to the very sill of the door of death How he wast-ed and wast-ed away in those few long lin-ger-ing days till there seemed but lit-tle left of him but his frame and tat-too-ing But as all else in him thinned and his cheek bones grew sharper his eyes nev-er-the-less seemed grow-ing fuller and fuller they be-came of a strange soft-ness of lus-tre and mild-ly but deeply looked out at you there from his sick-ness a won-drous tes-ti-mony to that im-mor-tal health in him which could not die or be weak-ened And like cir-cles on the wa-ter which as they grow fainter ex-pand so his eyes seemed round-ing and round-ing like the rings of Eter-ni-ty An awe that can-not be named would steal over you as you sat by the side of this wan-ing sav-age and saw as strange things in his face as any be-held who were by-standers when Zoroast-er died For what-ev-er is tru-ly won-drous and fear-ful in man nev-er yet was put in-to words or books And the draw-ing near of Death which alike lev-els all alike im-press-es all with a last rev-e-la-tion which on-ly an au-thor from the dead could ad-e-quate-ly tell So that let us say it again no dy-ing Chaldee or Greek had high-er and holier thoughts than those whose mys-te-ri-ous shades you saw creep-ing over the face of poor Quee-queg as he qui-et-ly lay in his sway-ing ham-mock and the rolling sea seemed gen-tly rock-ing him to his fi-nal rest and the ocean s in-vis-i-ble flood tide lift-ed him high-er and high-er to-wards his des-tined heav-en Not a man of the crew but gave him up and as for Quee-queg him-self what he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a cu-ri-ous favour he asked He called one to him in the grey morn-ing watch when the day was just break-ing and tak-ing his hand said that while in Nan-tuck-et he had chanced to see cer-tain lit-tle ca-noes of dark wood like the rich war wood of his na-tive isle and up-on in-quiry he had learned that all whale-men who died in Nan-tuck-et were laid in those same dark ca-noes and that the fan-cy of be-ing so laid had much pleased him for it was not un-like the cus-tom of his own race who af-ter em-balm-ing a dead war-rior stretched him out in his ca-noe and so left him to be float-ed away to the star-ry archipela-goes for not on-ly do they be-lieve that the stars are isles but that far be-yond all vis-i-ble hori-zons their own mild un-con-ti-nent-ed seas in-ter-flow with the blue heav-ens and so form the white break-ers of the milky way He added that he shud-dered at the thought of be-ing buried in his ham-mock ac-cord-ing to the usu-al sea cus-tom tossed like some-thing vile to the death de-vour-ing sharks No he de-sired a ca-noe like those of Nan-tuck-et all the more con-ge-nial to him be-ing a whale-man that like a whale boat the-se coffin ca-noes were with-out a keel though that in-volved but un-cer-tain steer-ing and much lee way ad-own the dim ages Now when this strange cir-cum-stance was made known aft the car-pen-ter was at on-ce com-mand-ed to do Quee-queg s bid-ding what-ev-er it might in-clude There was some hea-then-ish coffin coloured old lum-ber aboard which up-on a long pre-vi-ous voy-age had been cut from the abo-rig-i-nal groves of the Lack-a-day is-lands and from the-se dark planks the coffin was rec-om-mend-ed to be made No soon-er was the car-pen-ter ap-prised of the or-der than tak-ing his rule he forth-with with all the in-dif-fer-ent promp-ti-tude of his char-ac-ter pro-ceed-ed in-to the fore-castle and took Quee-queg s mea-sure with great ac-cu-ra-cy reg-u-lar-ly chalk-ing Quee-queg s per-son as he shift-ed the rule  Ah poor fel-low he ll have to die now  ejac-u-lat-ed the Long Is-land sailor Go-ing to his vice bench the car-pen-ter for con-ve-nience sake and gen-er-al ref-er-ence now trans-fer-ring-ly mea-sured on it the ex-act length the coffin was to be and then made the trans-fer per-ma-nent by cut-ting two notch-es at its ex-trem-i-ties This done he mar-shalled the planks and his tools and to work When the last nail was driven and the lid du-ly planed and fit-ted he light-ly shoul-dered the coffin and went for-ward with it in-quir-ing whether they were ready for it yet in that di-rec-tion Over-hear-ing the in-dig-nant but half hu-mor-ous cries with which the peo-ple on deck be-gan to drive the coffin away Quee-queg to ev-ery one s con-ster-na-tion com-mand-ed that the thing should be in-stant-ly brought to him nor was there any deny-ing him see-ing that of all mor-tals some dy-ing men are the most tyran-ni-cal and cer-tain-ly since they will short-ly trou-ble us so lit-tle for ev-er-more the poor fel-lows ought to be in-dulged Lean-ing over in his ham-mock Quee-queg long re-gard-ed the coffin with an at-ten-tive eye He then called for his har-poon had the wood-en stock drawn from it and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along with one of the pad-dles of his boat All by his own re-quest al-so bis-cuits were then ranged round the sides with-in a flask of fresh wa-ter was placed at the head and a small bag of woody earth scraped up in the hold at the foot and a piece of sail cloth be-ing rolled up for a pil-low Quee-queg now en-treat-ed to be lift-ed in-to his fi-nal bed that he might make tri-al of its com-forts if any it had He lay with-out mov-ing a few min-utes then told one to go to his bag and bring out his lit-tle god Yo-jo Then cross-ing his ar-ms on his breast with Yo-jo be-tween he called for the coffin lid hatch he called it to be placed over him The head part turned over with a leather hinge and there lay Quee-queg in his coffin with lit-tle but his com-posed coun-te-nance in view  Rar-mai it will do it is easy he mur-mured at last and signed to be re-placed in his ham-mock But ere this was done Pip who had been slily hov-er-ing near by all this while drew nigh to him where he lay and with soft sob-bings took him by the hand in the oth-er hold-ing his tam-bourine  Poor rover will ye nev-er have done with all this weary rov-ing where go ye now But if the cur-ren-ts car-ry ye to those sweet An-tilles where the beach-es are on-ly beat with wa-ter lilies will ye do one lit-tle er-rand for me Seek out one Pip who s now been miss-ing long I think he s in those far An-tilles If ye find him then com-fort him for he must be very sad for look he s left his tam-bourine be-hind  I found it Rig a dig dig dig Now Quee-queg die and I ll beat ye your dy-ing march   I have heard  mur-mured Star-buck gaz-ing down the scut-tle  that in vi-o-lent fevers men all ig-no-rance have talked in an-cient tongues and that when the mys-tery is probed it turns out al-ways that in their whol-ly for-got-ten child-hood those an-cient tongues had been re-al-ly spo-ken in their hear-ing by some lofty schol-ars So to my fond faith poor Pip in this strange sweet-ness of his lu-na-cy brings heav-en-ly vouch-ers of all our heav-en-ly homes Where learned he that but there  Hark he speaks again but more wild-ly now   Form two and two Let s make a Gen-er-al of him Ho where s his har-poon Lay it across here  Rig a dig dig dig huz-za Oh for a game cock now to sit up-on his head and crow Quee-queg dies game  mind ye that Quee-queg dies game  take ye good heed of that Quee-queg dies game I say game game game but base lit-tle Pip he died a cow-ard died all a shiv-er  out up-on Pip Hark ye if ye find Pip tell all the An-tilles he s a run-away a cow-ard a cow-ard a cow-ard Tell them he jumped from a whale boat I d nev-er beat my tam-bourine over base Pip and hail him Gen-er-al if he were on-ce more dy-ing here No no shame up-on all cow-ard-s shame up-on them Let  em go drown like Pip that jumped from a whale boat Shame shame  Dur-ing all this Quee-queg lay with closed eyes as if in a dream Pip was led away and the sick man was re-placed in his ham-mock But now that he had ap-par-ent-ly made ev-ery prepa-ra-tion for death now that his coffin was proved a good fit Quee-queg sud-den-ly ral-lied soon there seemed no need of the car-pen-ter s box and there-upon when some ex-pressed their de-light-ed sur-prise he in sub-stance said that the cause of his sud-den con-va-les-cence was this  at a crit-i-cal mo-ment he had just re-called a lit-tle du-ty ashore which he was leav-ing un-done and there-fore had changed his mind about dy-ing he could not die yet he averred They asked him then whether to live or die was a mat-ter of his own sovereign will and plea-sure He an-swered cer-tain-ly In a word it was Quee-queg s con-ceit that if a man made up his mind to live mere sick-ness could not kill him noth-ing but a whale or a gale or some vi-o-lent un-govern-able un-in-tel-li-gent de-stroy-er of that sort Now there is this note-wor-thy dif-fer-ence be-tween sav-age and civ-i-lized that while a sick civ-i-lized man may be six months con-va-lesc-ing gen-er-al-ly speak-ing a sick sav-age is al-most half well again in a day So in good time my Quee-queg gained strength and at length af-ter sit-ting on the wind-lass for a few in-do-lent days but eat-ing with a vig-or-ous ap-petite he sud-den-ly leaped to his feet threw out his ar-ms and legs gave him-self a good stretch-ing yawned a lit-tle bit and then spring-ing in-to the head of his hoist-ed boat and pois-ing a har-poon pro-nounced him-self fit for a fight With a wild whim-si-ness he now used his coffin for a sea chest and emp-ty-ing in-to it his can-vas bag of clothes set them in or-der there Many spare hours he spent in carv-ing the lid with all man-ner of grotesque fig-ures and draw-ings and it seemed that here-by he was striv-ing in his rude way to copy parts of the twist-ed tat-too-ing on his body And this tat-too-ing had been the work of a de-part-ed prophet and seer of his is-land who by those hi-ero-glyph-ic marks had writ-ten out on his body a com-plete the-o-ry of the heav-ens and the earth and a mys-ti-cal trea-tise on the art of at-tain-ing truth so that Quee-queg in his own prop-er per-son was a rid-dle to un-fold a won-drous work in one vol-ume but whose mys-ter-ies not even him-self could read though his own live heart beat again-st them and the-se mys-ter-ies were there-fore des-tined in the end to moul-der away with the liv-ing parch-ment where-on they were in-scribed and so be un-solved to the last And this thought it must have been which sug-gest-ed to Ahab that wild ex-cla-ma-tion of his when one morn-ing turn-ing away from sur-vey-ing poor Quee-queg  Oh dev-il-ish tan-ta-liza-tion of the gods  CHAPTER 111 The Paci-fic When glid-ing by the Bashee isles we emerged at last up-on the great South Sea were it not for oth-er things I could have greet-ed my dear Paci-fic with un-count-ed thanks for now the long sup-pli-ca-tion of my youth was an-swered that serene ocean rolled east-wards from me a thou-sand leagues of blue There is one knows not what sweet mys-tery about this sea whose gen-tly aw-ful stir-rings seem to speak of some hid-den soul be-neath like those fa-bled un-du-la-tions of the Eph-e-sian sod over the buried Evan-ge-list St John And meet it is that over the-se sea pas-tures wide rolling wa-tery prairies and Pot-ter-s Fields of all four con-ti-nen-ts the waves should rise and fall and ebb and flow un-ceas-ing-ly for here mil-lions of mixed shades and shad-ows drowned dreams som-nam-bu-lis-ms rever-ies all that we call lives and souls lie dream-ing dream-ing still toss-ing like slum-ber-ers in their beds the ev-er rolling waves but made so by their rest-less-ness To any med-i-ta-tive Ma-gian rover this serene Paci-fic on-ce be-held must ev-er af-ter be the sea of his adop-tion It rol-ls the mid-most wa-ters of the world the In-di-an ocean and At-lantic be-ing but its ar-ms The same waves wash the moles of the new built Cal-i-for-ni-an towns but yes-ter-day plant-ed by the re-cen-test race of men and lave the fad-ed but still gor-geous skirts of Asi-at-ic lands old-er than Abra-ham while all be-tween float milky ways of coral isles and low ly-ing end-less un-known Archipela-goes and im-pen-e-tra-ble Ja-pans Thus this mys-te-ri-ous di-vine Paci-fic zones the world s whole bulk about makes all coasts one bay to it seems the tide beat-ing heart of earth Lift-ed by those eter-nal swells you needs must own the se-duc-tive god bow-ing your head to Pan But few thoughts of Pan stirred Ahab s brain as stand-ing like an iron stat-ue at his ac-cus-tomed place beside the mizen rig-ging with one nos-tril he un-think-ing-ly snuffed the sug-ary musk from the Bashee isles in whose sweet woods mild lovers must be walk-ing and with the oth-er con-scious-ly in-haled the salt breath of the new found sea that sea in which the hat-ed White Whale must even then be swim-ming Launched at length up-on the-se al-most fi-nal wa-ters and glid-ing to-wards the Ja-pane-se cruis-ing ground the old man s pur-pose in-ten-si-fied it-self His firm lips met like the lips of a vice the Delta of his fore-head s veins swelled like over-laden brooks in his very sleep his ring-ing cry ran through the vault-ed hull  Stern all the White Whale spouts thick blood  CHAPTER 112 The Black-smith Avail-ing him-self of the mild sum-mer cool weath-er that now reigned in the-se lat-i-tudes and in prepa-ra-tion for the pe-cu-liar-ly ac-tive pur-suits short-ly to be an-tic-i-pat-ed Perth the be-grimed blis-tered old black-smith had not re-moved his portable forge to the hold again af-ter con-clud-ing his con-trib-u-to-ry work for Ahab s leg but still re-tained it on deck fast lashed to ring-bolts by the fore-mast be-ing now al-most in-ces-sant-ly in-voked by the heads-men and har-pooneers and bows-men to do some lit-tle job for them al-ter-ing or re-pair-ing or new shap-ing their var-i-ous weapons and boat fur-ni-ture Often he would be sur-round-ed by an ea-ger cir-cle all wait-ing to be served hold-ing boat spades pike heads har-poons and lances and jeal-ous-ly watch-ing his ev-ery sooty move-ment as he toiled Nev-er-the-less this old man s was a pa-tient ham-mer wield-ed by a pa-tient arm No mur-mur no im-pa-tience no petu-lance did come from him Si-lent slow and solemn bow-ing over still fur-ther his chron-i-cal-ly bro-ken back he toiled away as if toil were life it-self and the heavy beat-ing of his ham-mer the heavy beat-ing of his heart And so it was  Most mis-er-able A pe-cu-liar walk in this old man a cer-tain slight but painful ap-pear-ing yaw-ing in his gait had at an ear-ly pe-ri-od of the voy-age ex-cit-ed the cu-rios-i-ty of the mariners And to the im-por-tu-ni-ty of their per-sist-ed ques-tion-ings he had fi-nal-ly given in and so it came to pass that ev-ery one now knew the shame-ful sto-ry of his wretched fate Be-lat-ed and not in-no-cent-ly one bit-ter win-ter s mid-night on the road run-ning be-tween two coun-try towns the black-smith half stupid-ly felt the dead-ly numb-ness steal-ing over him and sought refuge in a lean-ing di-lap-i-dat-ed barn The is-sue was the loss of the ex-trem-i-ties of both feet Out of this rev-e-la-tion part by part at last came out the four ac-ts of the glad-ness and the one long and as yet un-catas-tro-phied fifth act of the grief of his life s dra-ma He was an old man who at the age of near-ly six-ty had post-poned-ly en-coun-tered that thing in sor-row s tech-ni-cals called ru-in He had been an ar-ti-san of famed ex-cel-lence and with plen-ty to do owned a house and gar-den em-braced a youth-ful daugh-ter like lov-ing wife and three blithe rud-dy chil-dren ev-ery Sun-day went to a cheer-ful look-ing church plant-ed in a grove But one night un-der cov-er of dark-ness and fur-ther con-cealed in a most cun-ning dis-guise-ment a des-per-ate bur-glar slid in-to his hap-py home and robbed them all of ev-ery-thing And dark-er yet to tell the black-smith him-self did ig-no-rant-ly con-duct this bur-glar in-to his fam-i-ly s heart It was the Bot-tle Con-juror Upon the open-ing of that fa-tal cork forth flew the fiend and shriv-elled up his home Now for pru-dent most wise and eco-nomic rea-sons the black-smith s shop was in the base-ment of his dwelling but with a sep-a-rate en-trance to it so that al-ways had the young and lov-ing healthy wife lis-tened with no un-hap-py ner-vous-ness but with vig-or-ous plea-sure to the stout ring-ing of her young armed old hus-band s ham-mer whose re-ver-ber-a-tions muf-fled by pass-ing through the floors and wal-ls came up to her not unsweet-ly in her nurs-ery and so to stout Labor s iron lul-laby the black-smith s in-fan-ts were rocked to slum-ber Oh woe on woe Oh Death why canst thou not some-times be time-ly Had-st thou tak-en this old black-smith to thy-self ere his full ru-in came up-on him then had the young wid-ow had a de-li-cious grief and her or-phans a tru-ly ven-er-a-ble leg-endary sire to dream of in their af-ter years and all of them a care killing com-pe-ten-cy But Death plucked down some vir-tu-ous el-der broth-er on whose whistling dai-ly toil sole-ly hung the re-spon-si-bil-i-ties of some oth-er fam-i-ly and left the worse than use-less old man stand-ing till the hideous rot of life should make him eas-ier to har-vest Why tell the whole The blows of the base-ment ham-mer ev-ery day grew more and more be-tween and each blow ev-ery day grew fainter than the last the wife sat frozen at the win-dow with tear-less eyes glit-ter-ing-ly gaz-ing in-to the weep-ing faces of her chil-dren the bel-lows fell the forge choked up with cin-ders the house was sold the moth-er dived down in-to the long church yard grass her chil-dren twice fol-lowed her thith-er and the house-less fam-i-ly-less old man stag-gered off a vagabond in crape his ev-ery woe un-rev-er-enced his grey head a scorn to flax-en curls Death seems the on-ly de-sir-able se-quel for a ca-reer like this but Death is on-ly a launch-ing in-to the re-gion of the strange Un-tried it is but the first salu-ta-tion to the pos-si-bil-i-ties of the im-mense Re-mote the Wild the Watery the Un-shored there-fore to the death long-ing eyes of such men who still have left in them some in-te-ri-or com-punc-tions again-st sui-cide does the all con-tribut-ed and all re-cep-tive ocean al-lur-ing-ly spread forth his whole plain of unimag-in-able tak-ing ter-rors and won-der-ful new life ad-ven-tures and from the hearts of

a whal-ing CHAPTER 113 The Forge With mat-ted beard and swathed in a bristling shark skin apron about mid day Perth was stand-ing be-tween his forge and anvil the lat-ter placed up-on an iron wood log with one hand hold-ing a pike head in the coals and with the oth-er at his forge s lungs when Cap-tain Ahab came along car-ry-ing in his hand a small rusty look-ing leath-ern bag While yet a lit-tle dis-tance from the forge moody Ahab paused till at last Perth with-draw-ing his iron from the fire be-gan ham-mer-ing it up-on the anvil the red mass send-ing off the sparks in thick hov-er-ing flights some of which flew close to Ahab  Are the-se thy Mother Carey s chick-ens Perth they are al-ways fly-ing in thy wake birds of good omen too but not to all  look here they burn but thou thou liv st among them with-out a scorch   Be-cause I am scorched all over Cap-tain Ahab  an-swered Perth rest-ing for a mo-ment on his ham-mer  I am past scorch-ing not eas-i-ly can st thou scorch a scar   Well well no more Thy shrunk voice sounds too calm-ly sane-ly woe-ful to me In no Par-adise my-self I am im-pa-tient of all mis-ery in oth-ers that is not mad Thou should st go mad black-smith say why dost thou not go mad How can st thou en-dure with-out be-ing mad Do the heav-ens yet hate thee that thou can st not go mad  What wert thou mak-ing there   Weld-ing an old pike head sir there were seams and den-ts in it   And can st thou make it all smooth again black-smith af-ter such hard us-age as it had   I think so sir   And I sup-pose thou can st smoothe al-most any seams and den-ts nev-er mind how hard the met-al black-smith   Aye sir I think I can all seams and den-ts but one   Look ye here then  cried Ahab pas-sion-ate-ly ad-vanc-ing and lean-ing with both hands on Perth s shoul-ders  look ye here here  can ye smoothe out a seam like this black-smith  sweep-ing one hand across his ribbed brow  if thou could st black-smith glad enough would I lay my head up-on thy anvil and feel thy heav-i-est ham-mer be-tween my eyes An-swer Can st thou smoothe this seam   Oh that is the one sir Said I not all seams and den-ts but one   Aye black-smith it is the one aye man it is un-smooth-able for though thou on-ly see st it here in my flesh it has worked down in-to the bone of my skul-l that is all wrin-kles But away with child s play no more gaffs and pikes to day Look ye here  jin-gling the leath-ern bag as if it were full of gold coins  I too want a har-poon made one that a thou-sand yoke of fiends could not part Perth some-thing that will stick in a whale like his own fin bone There s the stuff  fling-ing the pouch up-on the anvil  Look ye black-smith the-se are the gath-ered nail stub-bs of the steel shoes of rac-ing hors-es   Horse shoe stub-bs sir Why Cap-tain Ahab thou hast here then the best and stub-bornest stuff we black-smiths ev-er work   I know it old man the-se stub-bs will weld to-geth-er like glue from the melt-ed bones of mur-der-ers Quick forge me the har-poon And forge me first twelve rods for its shank then wind and twist and ham-mer the-se twelve to-geth-er like the yarns and strands of a tow line Quick I ll blow the fire  When at last the twelve rods were made Ahab tried them one by one by spi-ralling them with his own hand round a long heavy iron bolt  A flaw  re-ject-ing the last one  Work that over again Perth  This done Perth was about to be-gin weld-ing the twelve in-to one when Ahab stayed his hand and said he would weld his own iron As then with reg-u-lar gasp-ing hems he ham-mered on the anvil Perth pass-ing to him the glow-ing rods one af-ter the oth-er and the hard pressed forge shoot-ing up its in-tense straight flame the Parsee passed silent-ly and bow-ing over his head to-wards the fire seemed in-vok-ing some curse or some bless-ing on the toil But as Ahab looked up he slid aside  What s that bunch of lu-cifers dodg-ing about there for  mut-tered Stubb look-ing on from the fore-castle  That Parsee smells fire like a fusee and smells of it him-self like a hot mus-ket s pow-der pan  At last the shank in one com-plete rod re-ceived its fi-nal heat and as Perth to tem-per it plunged it all hiss-ing in-to the cask of wa-ter near by the scald-ing steam shot up in-to Ahab s bent face  Would st thou brand me Perth  winc-ing for a mo-ment with the pain  have I been but forg-ing my own brand-ing iron then   Pray God not that yet I fear some-thing Cap-tain Ahab Is not this har-poon for the White Whale   For the white fiend But now for the bar-bs thou must make them thy-self man Here are my ra-zors the best of steel here and make the bar-bs sharp as the needle sleet of the Icy Sea  For a mo-ment the old black-smith eyed the ra-zors as though he would fain not use them  Take them man I have no need for them for I now nei-ther shave sup nor pray till but here to work  Fash-ioned at last in-to an ar-rowy shape and weld-ed by Perth to the shank the steel soon point-ed the end of the iron and as the black-smith was about giv-ing the bar-bs their fi-nal heat pri-or to tem-per-ing them he cried to Ahab to place the wa-ter cask near  No no no wa-ter for that I want it of the true death tem-per Ahoy there Tashte-go Quee-queg Dag-goo What say ye pa-gans Will ye give me as much blood as will cov-er this barb  hold-ing it high up A clus-ter of dark nods replied Yes Three punc-tures were made in the hea-then flesh and the White Whale s bar-bs were then tem-pered  Ego non bap-ti-zo te in nomine pa-tris sed in nomine di-a-boli  deliri-ous-ly howled Ahab as the ma-lig-nant iron scorch-ing-ly de-voured the bap-tismal blood Now mus-ter-ing the spare poles from be-low and se-lect-ing one of hick-o-ry with the bark still in-vest-ing it Ahab fit-ted the end to the sock-et of the iron A coil of new tow line was then un-wound and some fath-oms of it tak-en to the wind-lass and stretched to a great ten-sion Press-ing his foot up-on it till the rope hummed like a harp string then ea-ger-ly bend-ing over it and see-ing no strand-ings Ahab ex-claimed  Good and now for the seiz-ings  At one ex-trem-i-ty the rope was un-strand-ed and the sep-a-rate spread yarns were all braid-ed and wo-ven round the sock-et of the har-poon the pole was then driven hard up in-to the sock-et from the low-er end the rope was traced half way along the pole s length and firm-ly se-cured so with in-ter-twist-ings of twine This done pole iron and rope like the Three Fates re-mained in-sep-a-ra-ble and Ahab mood-i-ly stalked away with the weapon the sound of his ivory leg and the sound of the hick-o-ry pole both hol-low-ly ring-ing along ev-ery plank But ere he en-tered his cab-in light un-nat-u-ral half ban-ter-ing yet most piteous sound was heard Oh Pip thy wretched laugh thy idle but un-rest-ing eye all thy strange mum-meries not un-mean-ing-ly blend-ed with the black tragedy of the melan-choly ship and mocked it CHAPTER 114 The Gilder Pen-e-trat-ing fur-ther and fur-ther in-to the heart of the Ja-pane-se cruis-ing ground the Pe-quod was soon all astir in the fish-ery Often in mild pleas-ant weath-er for twelve fif-teen eigh-teen and twen-ty hours on the stretch they were en-gaged in the boats steadi-ly pulling or sail-ing or pad-dling af-ter the whales or for an in-ter-lude of six-ty or sev-en-ty min-utes calm-ly await-ing their up-ris-ing though with but small suc-cess for their pains At such times un-der an abat-ed sun afloat all day up-on smooth slow heav-ing swells seat-ed in his boat light as a birch ca-noe and so so-cia-bly mix-ing with the soft waves them-selves that like hearth stone cats they purr again-st the gun-wale the-se are the times of dreamy qui-etude when be-hold-ing the tran-quil beau-ty and bril-lian-cy of the ocean s skin one for-gets the tiger heart that pan-ts be-neath it and would not will-ing-ly re-mem-ber that this velvet paw but con-ceals a re-morse-less fang Th-e-se are the times when in his whale boat the rover soft-ly feels a cer-tain fil-ial con-fi-dent land like feel-ing to-wards the sea that he re-gards it as so much flow-ery earth and the dis-tant ship re-veal-ing on-ly the tops of her mas-ts seems strug-gling for-ward not through high rolling waves but through the tall grass of a rolling prair-ie as when the west-ern em-i-grants hors-es on-ly show their erect-ed ears while their hid-den bod-ies wide-ly wade through the amaz-ing ver-dure The long drawn vir-gin vales the mild blue hill sides as over the-se there steals the hush the hum you al-most swear that play wea-ried chil-dren lie sleep-ing in the-se soli-tudes in some glad May time when the flow-ers of the woods are plucked And all this mix-es with your most mys-tic mood so that fact and fan-cy half way meet-ing in-ter-pen-e-trate and form one seam-less whole Nor did such sooth-ing sce-nes how-ev-er tem-po-rary fail of at least as tem-po-rary an ef-fect on Ahab But if the-se se-cret gold-en keys did seem to open in him his own se-cret gold-en trea-suries yet did his breath up-on them prove but tar-nish-ing Oh grassy glades oh ev-er ver-nal end-less land-scapes in the soul in ye  though long parched by the dead drought of the earthy life  in ye men yet may roll like young hors-es in new morn-ing clover and for some few fleet-ing mo-men-ts feel the cool dew of the life im-mor-tal on them Would to God the-se blessed calms would last But the min-gled min-gling threads of life are wo-ven by warp and woof calms crossed by stor-ms a storm for ev-ery calm There is no steady un-re-trac-ing pro-gress in this life we do not ad-vance through fixed gra-da-tions and at the last one pause  through in-fan-cy s un-con-scious spell boy-hood s thought-less faith ado-les-cence doubt the com-mon doom then scep-ti-cism then dis-be-lief rest-ing at last in man-hood s pon-der-ing re-pose of If But on-ce gone through we trace the round again and are in-fan-ts boys and men and Ifs eter-nal-ly Where lies the fi-nal har-bor whence we un-moor no more In what rapt ether sails the world of which the wea-ri-est will nev-er weary Where is the foundling s fa-ther hid-den Our souls are like those or-phans whose un-wed-ded moth-ers die in bear-ing them the se-cret of our pa-ter-ni-ty lies in their grave and we must there to learn it And that same day too gaz-ing far down from his boat s side in-to that same gold-en sea Star-buck low-ly mur-mured   Love-li-ness un-fath-omable as ev-er lover saw in his young bride s eye  Tell me not of thy teeth tiered sharks and thy kid-nap-ping can-ni-bal ways Let faith oust fact let fan-cy oust mem-o-ry I look deep down and do be-lieve  And Stubb fish like with sparkling scales leaped up in that same gold-en light   I am Stubb and Stubb has his his-to-ry but here Stubb takes oaths that he has al-ways been jol-ly  CHAPTER 115 The Pe-quod Meets The Bach-e-lor And jol-ly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bear-ing down be-fore the wind some few weeks af-ter Ahab s har-poon had been weld-ed It was a Nan-tuck-et ship the Bach-e-lor which had just wedged in her last cask of oil and bolt-ed down her burst-ing hatch-es and now in glad hol-i-day ap-par-el was joy-ous-ly though some-what vain glo-ri-ous-ly sail-ing round among the wide-ly sep-a-rat-ed ships on the ground pre-vi-ous to point-ing her prow for home The three men at her mast head wore long stream-ers of nar-row red bunting at their hats from the stern a whale boat was sus-pend-ed bot-tom down and hang-ing cap-tive from the bowsprit was seen the long low-er jaw of the last whale they had slain Sig-nals en-signs and jacks of all colours were fly-ing from her rig-ging on ev-ery side Side-ways lashed in each of her three bas-ket-ed tops were two bar-rels of sperm above which in her top mast cross trees you saw slen-der break-ers of the same pre-cious flu-id and nailed to her main truck was a brazen lamp As was af-ter-wards learned the Bach-e-lor had met with the most sur-pris-ing suc-cess all the more won-der-ful for that while cruis-ing in the same seas nu-mer-ous oth-er ves-sels had gone en-tire months with-out se-cur-ing a sin-gle fish Not on-ly had bar-rels of beef and bread been given away to make room for the far more valu-able sperm but ad-di-tion-al sup-ple-men-tal casks had been bartered for from the ships she had met and the-se were stowed along the deck and in the cap-tain s and of-fi-cer-s state rooms Even the cab-in table it-self had been knocked in-to kin-dling wood and the cab-in mess dined off the broad head of an oil butt lashed down to the floor for a cen-tre-piece In the fore-castle the sailors had ac-tu-al-ly caulked and pitched their chests and filled them it was hu-mor-ous-ly added that the cook had clapped a head on his largest boil-er and filled it that the stew-ard had plugged his spare cof-fee pot and filled it that the har-pooneers had head-ed the sock-ets of their irons and filled them that in-deed ev-ery-thing was filled with sperm ex-cept the cap-tain s pan-taloons pock-ets and those he re-served to thrust his hands in-to in self com-pla-cent tes-ti-mony of his en-tire sat-is-fac-tion As this glad ship of good luck bore down up-on the moody Pe-quod the bar-bar-ian sound of enor-mous drums came from her fore-castle and draw-ing still nearer a crowd of her men were seen stand-ing round her huge try pots which cov-ered with the parch-ment like poke or stom-ach skin of the black fish gave forth a loud roar to ev-ery stroke of the clenched hands of the crew On the quar-ter deck the mates and har-pooneers were danc-ing with the olive hued girls who had eloped with them from the Poly-ne-sian Isles while sus-pend-ed in an or-na-ment-ed boat firm-ly se-cured aloft be-tween the fore-mast and main-mast three Long Is-land ne-groes with glit-ter-ing fid-dle bows of whale ivory were pre-sid-ing over the hi-lar-i-ous jig Mean-while oth-ers of the ship s com-pa-ny were tu-mul-tuous-ly busy at the ma-son-ry of the try works from which the huge pots had been re-moved You would have al-most thought they were pulling down the cursed Bastille such wild cries they raised as the now use-less brick and mor-tar were be-ing hurled in-to the sea Lord and mas-ter over all this scene the cap-tain stood erect on the ship s el-e-vat-ed quar-ter deck so that the whole re-joic-ing dra-ma was full be-fore him and seemed mere-ly con-trived for his own in-di-vid-u-al di-ver-sion And Ahab he too was stand-ing on his quar-ter deck shag-gy and black with a stub-born gloom and as the two ships crossed each oth-er s wakes one all ju-bi-la-tions for things passed the oth-er all fore-bod-ings as to things to come their two cap-tains in them-selves im-per-son-at-ed the whole strik-ing con-trast of the scene  Come aboard come aboard  cried the gay Bach-e-lor s com-man-der lift-ing a glass and a bot-tle in the air  Hast seen the White Whale  grit-ted Ahab in re-ply  No on-ly heard of him but don t be-lieve in him at all  said the oth-er good hu-mored-ly  Come aboard   Thou art too damned jol-ly Sail on Hast lost any men   Not enough to speak of two is-landers that s all  but come aboard old hearty come along I ll soon take that black from your brow Come along will ye mer-ry s the play a full ship and home-ward bound   How won-drous fa-mil-iar is a fool  mut-tered Ahab then aloud  Thou art a full ship and home-ward bound thou sayst well then call me an emp-ty ship and out-ward bound So go thy ways and I will mine For-ward there Set all sail and keep her to the wind  And thus while the one ship went cheer-i-ly be-fore the breeze the oth-er stub-born-ly fought again-st it and so the two ves-sels part-ed the crew of the Pe-quod look-ing with grave lin-ger-ing glances to-wards the re-ced-ing Bach-e-lor but the Bach-e-lor s men nev-er heed-ing their gaze for the live-ly rev-el-ry they were in And as Ahab lean-ing over the taffrail eyed the home-ward bound craft he took from his pock-et a small vial of sand and then look-ing from the ship to the vial seemed there-by bring-ing two re-mote as-so-ci-a-tions to-geth-er for that vial was filled with Nan-tuck-et sound-ings CHAPTER 116 The Dy-ing Whale Not sel-dom in this life when on the right side for-tune s favourites sail close by us we though all adroop be-fore catch some-what of the rush-ing breeze and joy-ful-ly feel our bag-ging sails fill out So seemed it with the Pe-quod For next day af-ter en-coun-ter-ing the gay Bach-e-lor whales were seen and four were slain and one of them by Ahab It was far down the af-ter-noon and when all the spear-ings of the crim-son fight were done and float-ing in the love-ly sun-set sea and sky sun and whale both stil-ly died to-geth-er then such a sweet-ness and such plain-tive-ness such in-wreath-ing orisons curled up in that rosy air that it al-most seemed as if far over from the deep green con-vent val-leys of the Manil-la isles the Span-ish land breeze wan-ton-ly turned sailor had gone to sea freight-ed with the-se ves-per hym-ns Soothed again but on-ly soothed to deep-er gloom Ahab who had sterned off from the whale sat in-tent-ly watch-ing his fi-nal wan-ings from the now tran-quil boat For that strange spec-ta-cle ob-serv-able in all sperm whales dy-ing the turn-ing sun-wards of the head and so ex-pir-ing that strange spec-ta-cle be-held of such a placid evening some-how to Ahab con-veyed a won-drous-ness un-known be-fore  He turns and turns him to it  how slow-ly but how stead-fast-ly his homage ren-der-ing and in-vok-ing brow with his last dy-ing mo-tions He too wor-ships fire most faith-ful broad ba-ro-nial vas-sal of the sun  Oh that the-se too favour-ing eyes should see the-se too favour-ing sights Look here far wa-ter locked be-yond all hum of hu-man weal or woe in the-se most can-did and im-par-tial seas where to tra-di-tions no rocks fur-nish tablets where for long Chi-ne-se ages the bil-lows have still rolled on speech-less and un-spo-ken to as stars that shine up-on the Niger s un-known source here too life dies sun-wards full of faith but see no soon-er dead than death whirls round the corpse and it heads some oth-er way  Oh thou dark Hin-doo half of na-ture who of drowned bones hast build-ed thy sep-a-rate throne some-where in the heart of the-se un-ver-dured seas thou art an in-fi-del thou queen and too tru-ly speakest to me in the wide slaugh-ter-ing Typhoon and the hushed buri-al of its af-ter calm Nor has this thy whale sun-wards turned his dy-ing head and then gone round again with-out a lesson to me  Oh tre-bly hooped and weld-ed hip of pow-er Oh high as-pir-ing rain-bowed jet  that one strivest this one jettest all in vain In vain oh whale dost thou seek in-ter-ced-ings with yon all quick-en-ing sun that on-ly cal-ls forth life but gives it not again Yet dost thou dark-er half rock me with a proud-er if a dark-er faith All thy un-nam-able im-min-glings float be-neath me here I am buoyed by breaths of on-ce liv-ing things ex-haled as air but wa-ter now  Then hail for ev-er hail O sea in whose eter-nal toss-ings the wild fowl finds his on-ly rest Born of earth yet suck-led by the sea though hill and val-ley moth-ered me ye bil-lows are my fos-ter broth-ers  CHAPTER 117 The Whale Watch The four whales slain that evening had died wide apart one far to wind-ward one less dis-tant to lee-ward one ahead one astern Th-e-se last three were brought alongside ere night-fall but the wind-ward one could not be reached till morn-ing and the boat that had killed it lay by its side all night and that boat was Ahab s The waif pole was thrust up-right in-to the dead whale s spout hole and the lantern hang-ing from its top cast a trou-bled flick-er-ing glare up-on the black glossy back and far out up-on the mid-night waves which gen-tly chafed the whale s broad flank like soft surf up-on a beach Ahab and all his boat s crew seemed asleep but the Parsee who crouch-ing in the bow sat watch-ing the sharks that spec-tral-ly played round the whale and tapped the light cedar planks with their tails A sound like the moan-ing in squadrons over Asphaltites of un-for-given ghosts of Go-mor-rah ran shud-der-ing through the air Start-ed from his slum-bers Ahab face to face saw the Parsee and hooped round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in a flood-ed world  I have dreamed it again  said he  Of the hears-es Have I not said old man that nei-ther hearse nor coffin can be thine   And who are hearsed that die on the sea   But I said old man that ere thou could-st die on this voy-age two hears-es must ver-i-ly be seen by thee on the sea the first not made by mor-tal hands and the vis-i-ble wood of the last one must be grown in Amer-i-ca   Aye aye a strange sight that Parsee  a hearse and its plumes float-ing over the ocean with the waves for the pall bear-ers Ha Such a sight we shall not soon see   Believe it or not thou canst not die till it be seen old man   And what was that say-ing about thy-self   Though it come to the last I shall still go be-fore thee thy pi-lot   And when thou art so gone be-fore if that ev-er be-fal-l then ere I can fol-low thou must still ap-pear to me to pi-lot me still  Was it not so Well then did I be-lieve all ye say oh my pi-lot I have here two pledges that I shall yet slay Moby Dick and sur-vive it   Take an-oth-er pledge old man  said the Parsee as his eyes light-ed up like fire flies in the gloom  Hemp on-ly can kill thee   The gal-lows ye mean  I am im-mor-tal then on land and on sea  cried Ahab with a laugh of de-ri-sion   Im-mor-tal on land and on sea  Both were silent again as one man The grey dawn came on and the slum-ber-ing crew arose from the boat s bot-tom and ere noon the dead whale was brought to the ship CHAPTER 118 The Quad-rant The sea-son for the Line at length drew near and ev-ery day when Ahab com-ing from his cab-in cast his eyes aloft the vig-i-lant helms-man would os-ten-ta-tious-ly han-dle his spokes and the ea-ger mariners quick-ly run to the braces and would stand there with all their eyes cen-tral-ly fixed on the nailed dou-bloon im-pa-tient for the or-der to point the ship s prow for the equa-tor In good time the or-der came It was hard up-on high noon and Ahab seat-ed in the bows of his high hoist-ed boat was about tak-ing his wont-ed dai-ly ob-ser-va-tion of the sun to de-ter-mine his lat-i-tude Now in that Ja-pane-se sea the days in sum-mer are as freshets of ef-ful-gences That un-blink-ing-ly vivid Ja-pane-se sun seems the blaz-ing fo-cus of the glassy ocean s im-mea-sur-able burn-ing glass The sky looks lac-quered clouds there are none the hori-zon floats and this naked-ness of un-re-lieved ra-di-ance is as the in-suf-fer-able splen-dors of God s throne Well that Ahab s quad-rant was fur-nished with coloured glass-es through which to take sight of that so-lar fire So swing-ing his seat-ed form to the roll of the ship and with his as-tro-log-i-cal look-ing in-stru-ment placed to his eye he re-mained in that pos-ture for some mo-men-ts to catch the pre-cise in-stant when the sun should gain its pre-cise merid-i-an Mean-time while his whole at-ten-tion was ab-sorbed the Parsee was kneel-ing be-neath him on the ship s deck and with face thrown up like Ahab s was eye-ing the same sun with him on-ly the lids of his eyes half hood-ed their or-bs and his wild face was sub-dued to an earth-ly pas-sion-less-ness At length the de-sired ob-ser-va-tion was tak-en and with his pen-cil up-on his ivory leg Ahab soon cal-cu-lat-ed what his lat-i-tude must be at that pre-cise in-stant Then falling in-to a mo-men-t s revery he again looked up to-wards the sun and mur-mured to him-self  Thou sea mark thou high and mighty Pilot thou tellest me tru-ly where I am  but canst thou cast the least hint where I shall be Or canst thou tell where some oth-er thing be-sides me is this mo-ment liv-ing Where is Moby Dick This in-stant thou must be eye-ing him Th-e-se eyes of mine look in-to the very eye that is even now be-hold-ing him aye and in-to the eye that is even now equal-ly be-hold-ing the ob-jec-ts on the un-known thith-er side of thee thou sun  Then gaz-ing at his quad-rant and han-dling one af-ter the oth-er its nu-mer-ous ca-bal-is-ti-cal con-trivances he pon-dered again and mut-tered  Fool-ish toy ba-bies play-thing of haughty Ad-mi-rals and Com-modor-es and Cap-tains the world brags of thee of thy cun-ning and might but what af-ter all canst thou do but tell the poor piti-ful point where thou thy-self hap-pen-est to be on this wide plan-et and the hand that holds thee no not one jot more Thou canst not tell where one drop of wa-ter or one grain of sand will be to mor-row noon and yet with thy im-po-tence thou in-sul-test the sun Science Curse thee thou vain toy and cursed be all the things that cast man s eyes aloft to that heav-en whose live vivid-ness but scorch-es him as the-se old eyes are even now scorched with thy light O sun Level by na-ture to this earth s hori-zon are the glances of man s eyes not shot from the crown of his head as if God had meant him to gaze on his fir-ma-ment Curse thee thou quad-rant  dash-ing it to the deck  no longer will I guide my earth-ly way by thee the lev-el ship s com-pass and the lev-el dead reck-on-ing by log and by line the-se shall con-duct me and show me my place on the sea Aye  light-ing from the boat to the deck  thus I tram-ple on thee thou pal-try thing that fee-bly pointest on high thus I split and de-stroy thee  As the fran-tic old man thus spoke and thus tram-pled with his live and dead feet a sneer-ing tri-umph that seemed meant for Ahab and a fa-tal-is-tic de-spair that seemed meant for him-self the-se passed over the mute mo-tion-less Parsee s face Unob-served he rose and glid-ed away while awestruck by the as-pect of their com-man-der the sea-men clus-tered to-geth-er on the fore-castle till Ahab trou-bled-ly pac-ing the deck shout-ed out  To the braces Up helm  square in  In an in-stant the yards swung round and as the ship half wheeled up-on her heel her three firm seat-ed grace-ful mas-ts erect-ly poised up-on her long ribbed hull seemed as the three Ho-ratii pirou-et-ting on one suf-fi-cient steed Stand-ing be-tween the knight heads Star-buck watched the Pe-quod s tu-mul-tuous way and Ahab s al-so as he went lurch-ing along the deck  I have sat be-fore the dense coal fire and watched it all aglow full of its tor-ment-ed flam-ing life and I have seen it wane at last down down to dumb-est dust Old man of oceans of all this fiery life of thine what will at length re-main but one lit-tle heap of ash-es   Aye  cried Stubb  but sea coal ash-es mind ye that Mr Star-buck sea coal not your com-mon char-coal Well well I heard Ahab mut-ter  Here some one thrusts the-se cards in-to the-se old hands of mine swears that I must play them and no oth-ers  And damn me Ahab but thou actest right live in the game and die in it  CHAPTER 119 The Can-dles Warmest climes but nurse the cru-ellest fangs the tiger of Ben-gal crouch-es in spiced groves of cease-less ver-dure Skies the most ef-ful-gent but bas-ket the dead-li-est thun-ders gor-geous Cuba knows tor-na-does that nev-er swept tame north-ern lands So too it is that in the-se re-splen-dent Ja-pane-se seas the mariner en-coun-ters the direst of all stor-ms the Typhoon It will some-times burst from out that cloud-less sky like an ex-plod-ing bomb up-on a dazed and sleepy town Towards evening of that day the Pe-quod was torn of her can-vas and bare poled was left to fight a Typhoon which had struck her di-rect-ly ahead When dark-ness came on sky and sea roared and split with the thun-der and blazed with the light-ning that showed the dis-abled mas-ts flut-ter-ing here and there with the rags which the first fury of the tem-pest had left for its af-ter sport Hold-ing by a shroud Star-buck was stand-ing on the quar-ter deck at ev-ery flash of the light-ning glanc-ing aloft to see what ad-di-tion-al dis-as-ter might have be-fal-l-en the in-tri-cate ham-per there while Stubb and Flask were di-rect-ing the men in the high-er hoist-ing and firmer lash-ing of the boats But all their pains seemed naught Though lift-ed to the very top of the cranes the wind-ward quar-ter boat Ahab s did not es-cape A great rolling sea dash-ing high up again-st the reel-ing ship s high tee-ter-ing side stove in the boat s bot-tom at the stern and left it again all drip-ping through like a sieve  Bad work bad work Mr Star-buck  said Stubb re-gard-ing the wreck  but the sea will have its way Stubb for one can t fight it You see Mr Star-buck a wave has such a great long start be-fore it leaps all round the world it runs and then comes the spring But as for me all the start I have to meet it is just across the deck here But nev-er mind it s all in fun so the old song says   sings Oh jol-ly is the gale And a jok-er is the whale A flour-ish-in his tail  Such a fun-ny sporty gamy jesty joky hoky poky lad is the Ocean oh The scud all a fly-in That s his flip on-ly foam-in When he stirs in the spicin  Such a fun-ny sporty gamy jesty joky hoky poky lad is the Ocean oh Thun-der splits the ships But he on-ly smacks his lips A tastin of this flip  Such a fun-ny sporty gamy jesty joky hoky poky lad is the Ocean oh  Avast Stubb  cried Star-buck  let the Typhoon sing and strike his harp here in our rig-ging but if thou art a brave man thou wilt hold thy peace   But I am not a brave man nev-er said I was a brave man I am a cow-ard and I sing to keep up my spir-its And I tell you what it is Mr Star-buck there s no way to stop my singing in this world but to cut my throat And when that s done ten to one I sing ye the dox-ol-o-gy for a wind up   Mad-man look through my eyes if thou hast none of thine own   What how can you see bet-ter of a dark night than any-body else nev-er mind how fool-ish   Here  cried Star-buck seiz-ing Stubb by the shoul-der and point-ing his hand to-wards the weath-er bow  markest thou not that the gale comes from the east-ward the very course Ahab is to run for Moby Dick the very course he swung to this day noon now mark his boat there where is that stove In the stern sheets man where he is wont to stand his stand point is stove man Now jump over-board and sing away if thou must  I don t half un-der-stand ye what s in the wind   Yes yes round the Cape of Good Hope is the short-est way to Nan-tuck-et  so-lil-o-quized Star-buck sud-den-ly heed-less of Stub-b s ques-tion  The gale that now ham-mers at us to stave us we can turn it in-to a fair wind that will drive us to-wards home Yon-der to wind-ward all is black-ness of doom but to lee-ward home-ward I see it light-ens up there but not with the light-ning  At that mo-ment in one of the in-ter-vals of pro-found dark-ness fol-low-ing the flash-es a voice was heard at his side and al-most at the same in-stant a vol-ley of thun-der peals rolled over-head  Who s there   Old Thun-der  said Ahab grop-ing his way along the bul-warks to his piv-ot hole but sud-den-ly find-ing his path made plain to him by el-bowed lances of fire Now as the light-ning rod to a spire on shore is in-tend-ed to car-ry off the per-ilous flu-id in-to the soil so the kin-dred rod which at sea some ships car-ry to each mast is in-tend-ed to con-duct it in-to the wa-ter But as this con-duc-tor must de-scend to con-sid-er-able depth that its end may avoid all con-tact with the hull and as more-over if kept con-stant-ly tow-ing there it would be li-able to many mishaps be-sides in-ter-fer-ing not a lit-tle with some of the rig-ging and more or less im-ped-ing the ves-sel s way in the wa-ter be-cause of all this the low-er parts of a ship s light-ning rods are not al-ways over-board but are gen-er-al-ly made in long slen-der links so as to be the more read-i-ly hauled up in-to the chains out-side or thrown down in-to the sea as oc-ca-sion may re-quire  The rods the rods  cried Star-buck to the crew sud-den-ly ad-mon-ished to vig-i-lance by the vivid light-ning that had just been dart-ing flam-beaux to light Ahab to his post  Are they over-board drop them over fore and aft Quick   Avast  cried Ahab  let s have fair play here though we be the weak-er side Yet I ll con-tribute to raise rods on the Him-male-hs and An-des that all the world may be se-cured but out on priv-i-leges Let them be sir   Look aloft  cried Star-buck  The cor-pu-san-ts the cor-pu-san-ts  All the yard ar-ms were tipped with a pal-lid fire and touched at each tri point-ed light-ning rod end with three ta-per-ing white flames each of the three tall mas-ts was silent-ly burn-ing in that sul-phurous air like three gi-gan-tic wax ta-pers be-fore an al-tar  Blast the boat let it go  cried Stubb at this in-stant as a swash-ing sea heaved up un-der his own lit-tle craft so that its gun-wale vi-o-lent-ly jammed his hand as he was pass-ing a lash-ing  Blast it   but slip-ping back-ward on the deck his up-lift-ed eyes caught the flames and im-me-di-ate-ly shift-ing his tone he cried  The cor-pu-san-ts have mer-cy on us all  To sailors oaths are house-hold words they will swear in the trance of the calm and in the teeth of the tem-pest they will im-pre-cate curs-es from the top-sail yard ar-ms when most they teeter over to a seething sea but in all my voy-ag-ings sel-dom have I heard a com-mon oath when God s burn-ing fin-ger has been laid on the ship when His  Mene Mene Tekel Upharsin has been wo-ven in-to the shrouds and the cordage While this pal-lid-ness was burn-ing aloft few words were heard from the en-chant-ed crew who in one thick clus-ter stood on the fore-castle all their eyes gleam-ing in that pale phos-pho-res-cence like a far away con-stel-la-tion of stars Relieved again-st the ghost-ly light the gi-gan-tic jet ne-gro Dag-goo loomed up to thrice his re-al stature and seemed the black cloud from which the thun-der had come The part-ed mouth of Tashte-go re-vealed his shark white teeth which strange-ly gleamed as if they too had been tipped by cor-pu-san-ts while lit up by the preter-nat-u-ral light Quee-queg s tat-too-ing burned like Satan-ic blue flames on his body The tableau all waned at last with the pal-lid-ness aloft and on-ce more the Pe-quod and ev-ery soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall A mo-ment or two passed when Star-buck go-ing for-ward pushed again-st some one It was Stubb  What thinkest thou now man I heard thy cry it was not the same in the song   No no it was-n t I said the cor-pu-san-ts have mer-cy on us all and I hope they will still But do they on-ly have mer-cy on long faces  have they no bow-els for a laugh And look ye Mr Star-buck but it s too dark to look Hear me then I take that mast head flame we saw for a sign of good luck for those mas-ts are root-ed in a hold that is go-ing to be chock a block with sperm oil d ye see and so all that sperm will work up in-to the mas-ts like sap in a tree Yes our three mas-ts will yet be as three sper-ma-ceti can-dles that s the good promise we saw  At that mo-ment Star-buck caught sight of Stub-b s face slow-ly be-gin-ning to glim-mer in-to sight Glanc-ing up-wards he cried  See see  and on-ce more the high ta-per-ing flames were be-held with what seemed re-dou-bled su-per-nat-u-ral-ness in their pal-lor  The cor-pu-san-ts have mer-cy on us all  cried Stubb again At the base of the main-mast full be-neath the dou-bloon and the flame the Parsee was kneel-ing in Ahab s front but with his head bowed away from him while near by from the arched and over-hang-ing rig-ging where they had just been en-gaged se-cur-ing a spar a num-ber of the sea-men ar-rest-ed by the glare now co-hered to-geth-er and hung pen-du-lous like a knot of numbed wasps from a droop-ing or-chard twig In var-i-ous en-chant-ed at-ti-tudes like the stand-ing or step-ping or run-ning skele-tons in Her-cu-la-neum oth-ers re-mained root-ed to the deck but all their eyes up-cast  Aye aye men  cried Ahab  Look up at it mark it well the white flame but lights the way to the White Whale Hand me those main-mast links there I would fain feel this pulse and let mine beat again-st it blood again-st fire So  Then turn-ing the last link held fast in his left hand he put his foot up-on the Parsee and with fixed up-ward eye and high flung right arm he stood erect be-fore the lofty tri point-ed trin-i-ty of flames  Oh thou clear spir-it of clear fire whom on the-se seas I as Per-sian on-ce did wor-ship till in the sacra-men-tal act so burned by thee that to this hour I bear the scar I now know thee thou clear spir-it and I now know that thy right wor-ship is de-fi-ance To nei-ther love nor rev-er-ence wilt thou be kind and e en for hate thou canst but kill and all are killed No fear-less fool now fron-ts thee I own thy speech-less place-less pow-er but to the last gasp of my earth-quake life will dis-pute its un-con-di-tion-al un-in-te-gral mas-tery in me In the mid-st of the per-son-i-fied im-per-son-al a per-son-al-i-ty stands here Though but a point at best whence-soe er I came where-soe er I go yet while I earth-ly live the queen-ly per-son-al-i-ty lives in me and feels her roy-al rights But war is pain and hate is woe Come in thy low-est form of love and I will kneel and kiss thee but at thy high-est come as mere su-per-nal pow-er and though thou launch-est navies of full freight-ed worlds there s that in here that still re-mains in-dif-fer-ent Oh thou clear spir-it of thy fire thou madest me and like a true child of fire I breathe it back to thee  Sud-den re-peat-ed flash-es of light-ning the nine flames leap length-wise to thrice their pre-vi-ous height Ahab with the rest clos-es his eyes his right hand pressed hard up-on them  I own thy speech-less place-less pow-er said I not so Nor was it wrung from me nor do I now drop the-se links Thou canst blind but I can then grope Thou canst con-sume but I can then be ash-es Take the homage of the-se poor eyes and shut-ter hands I would not take it The light-ning flash-es through my skull mine eye bal-ls ache and ache my whole beat-en brain seems as be-head-ed and rolling on some stun-ning ground Oh oh Yet blind-fold yet will I talk to thee Light though thou be thou leapest out of dark-ness but I am dark-ness leap-ing out of light leap-ing out of thee The javelins cease open eyes see or not There burn the flames Oh thou mag-nan-i-mous now I do glo-ry in my ge-neal-o-gy But thou art but my fiery fa-ther my sweet moth-er I know not Oh cru-el what hast thou done with her There lies my puz-zle but thine is greater Thou know-est not how came ye hence callest thy-self un-be-got-ten cer-tain-ly know-est not thy be-gin-ning hence callest thy-self un-be-gun I know that of me which thou know-est not of thy-self oh thou om-nipo-tent There is some un-suf-fus-ing thing be-yond thee thou clear spir-it to whom all thy eter-ni-ty is but time all thy cre-ative-ness me-chan-i-cal Through thee thy flam-ing self my scorched eyes do dim-ly see it Oh thou foundling fire thou her-mit im-memo-ri-al thou too hast thy in-com-mu-ni-ca-ble rid-dle thy un-par-tic-i-pat-ed grief Here again with haughty agony I read my sire Leap leap up and lick the sky I leap with thee I burn with thee would fain be weld-ed with thee de-fy-ing-ly I wor-ship thee   The boat the boat  cried Star-buck  look at thy boat old man  Ahab s har-poon the one forged at Perth s fire re-mained firm-ly lashed in its con-spic-u-ous crotch so that it pro-ject-ed be-yond his whale boat s bow but the sea that had stove its bot-tom had caused the loose leather sheath to drop off and from the keen steel barb there now came a lev-elled flame of pale forked fire As the silent har-poon burned there like a ser-pen-t s tongue Star-buck grasped Ahab by the ar-m  God God is again-st thee old man for-bear  tis an ill voy-age ill be-gun ill con-tin-ued let me square the yards while we may old man and make a fair wind of it home-wards to go on a bet-ter voy-age than this  Over-hear-ing Star-buck the pan-ic strick-en crew in-stant-ly ran to the braces though not a sail was left aloft For the mo-ment all the aghast mate s thoughts seemed theirs they raised a half muti-nous cry But dash-ing the rat-tling light-ning links to the deck and snatch-ing the burn-ing har-poon Ahab waved it like a torch among them swear-ing to trans-fix with it the first sailor that but cast loose a rope s end Pet-ri-fied by his as-pect and still more shrink-ing from the fiery dart that he held the men fell back in dis-may and Ahab again spoke   All your oaths to hunt the White Whale are as bind-ing as mine and heart soul and body lungs and life old Ahab is bound And that ye may know to what tune this heart beats look ye here thus I blow out the last fear  And with one blast of his breath he ex-tin-guished the flame As in the hur-ri-cane that sweeps the plain men fly the neigh-bor-hood of some lone gi-gan-tic elm whose very height and strength but ren-der it so much the more un-safe be-cause so much the more a mark for thun-der-bolts so at those last words of Ahab s many of the mariners did run from him in a ter-ror of dis-may CHAPTER 12 The Deck Towards the End of the First Night Watch Ahab stand-ing by the helm Star-buck ap-proach-ing him  We must send down the main top sail yard sir The band is work-ing loose and the lee lift is half strand-ed Shall I strike it sir   Strike noth-ing lash it If I had sky sail poles I d sway them up now   Sir  in God s name  sir   Well   The an-chors are work-ing sir Shall I get them in-board   Strike noth-ing and stir noth-ing but lash ev-ery-thing The wind ris-es but it has not got up to my table lands yet Quick and see to it  By mas-ts and keels he takes me for the hunch backed skip-per of some coast-ing smack Send down my main top sail yard Ho glue-pots Lofti-est trucks were made for wildest winds and this brain truck of mine now sails amid the cloud scud Shall I strike that Oh none but cow-ards send down their brain trucks in tem-pest time What a hooroosh aloft there I would e en take it for sub-lime did I not know that the col-ic is a noisy mal-a-dy Oh take medicine take medicine  CHAPTER 121 Mid-night  The Fore-castle Bul-warks Stubb and Flask mount-ed on them and pass-ing ad-di-tion-al lash-ings over the an-chors there hang-ing  No Stubb you may pound that knot there as much as you please but you will nev-er pound in-to me what you were just now say-ing And how long ago is it since you said the very con-trary Did-n t you on-ce say that what-ev-er ship Ahab sails in that ship should pay some-thing ex-tra on its in-sur-ance pol-i-cy just as though it were load-ed with pow-der bar-rels aft and box-es of lu-cifers for-ward Stop now did-n t you say so   Well sup-pose I did What then I ve part changed my flesh since that time why not my mind Be-sides sup-pos-ing we are load-ed with pow-der bar-rels aft and lu-cifers for-ward how the dev-il could the lu-cifers get afire in this drench-ing spray here Why my lit-tle man you have pret-ty red hair but you could-n t get afire now Shake your-self you re Aquar-ius or the wa-ter bearer Flask might fill pitch-ers at your coat col-lar Don t you see then that for the-se ex-tra risks the Marine In-surance com-pa-nies have ex-tra guar-an-tees Here are hy-dran-ts Flask But hark again and I ll an-swer ye the oth-er thing First take your leg off from the crown of the an-chor here though so I can pass the rope now lis-ten What s the mighty dif-fer-ence be-tween hold-ing a mas-t s light-ning rod in the storm and stand-ing close by a mast that has-n t got any light-ning rod at all in a storm Don t you see you tim-ber head that no harm can come to the hold-er of the rod un-less the mast is first struck What are you talk-ing about then Not one ship in a hun-dred car-ries rods and Ahab  aye man and all of us  were in no more dan-ger then in my poor opin-ion than all the crews in ten thou-sand ships now sail-ing the seas Why you King Post you I sup-pose you would have ev-ery man in the world go about with a small light-ning rod run-ning up the cor-ner of his hat like a mili-tia of-fi-cer s skew-ered feath-er and trail-ing be-hind like his sash Why don t ye be sen-si-ble Flask it s easy to be sen-si-ble why don t ye then any man with half an eye can be sen-si-ble   I don t know that Stubb You some-times find it rather hard   Yes when a fel-low s soaked through it s hard to be sen-si-ble that s a fact And I am about drenched with this spray Nev-er mind catch the turn there and pass it Seems to me we are lash-ing down the-se an-chors now as if they were nev-er go-ing to be used again Ty-ing the-se two an-chors here Flask seems like ty-ing a man s hands be-hind him And what big gen-er-ous hands they are to be sure Th-e-se are your iron fists hey What a hold they have too I won-der Flask whether the world is an-chored any-where if she is she swings with an un-com-mon long ca-ble though There ham-mer that knot down and we ve done So next to touch-ing land light-ing on deck is the most sat-is-fac-to-ry I say just wring out my jack-et skirts will ye Thank ye They laugh at long togs so Flask but seems to me a long tailed coat ought al-ways to be worn in all stor-ms afloat The tails ta-per-ing down that way serve to car-ry off the wa-ter d ye see Same with cocked hats the cocks form gable end eave troughs Flask No more mon-key jack-ets and tarpaulins for me I must mount a swal-low tail and drive down a beaver so Hal-loa whew there goes my tarpaulin over-board Lord Lord that the winds that come from heav-en should be so un-man-ner-ly This is a nasty night lad  CHAPTER 122 Mid-night Aloft  Thun-der and Light-ning The main top sail yard  Tashte-go pass-ing new lash-ings around it  Um um um Stop that thun-der Plen-ty too much thun-der up here What s the use of thun-der Um um um We don t want thun-der we want rum give us a glass of rum Um um um  CHAPTER 123 The Mus-ket Dur-ing the most vi-o-lent shocks of the Typhoon the man at the Pe-quod s jaw bone tiller had sev-er-al times been reel-ing-ly hurled to the deck by its spas-mod-ic mo-tions even though pre-ven-ter tack-les had been at-tached to it for they were slack be-cause some play to the tiller was in-dis-pens-able In a sev-ere gale like this while the ship is but a tossed shut-tle-cock to the blast it is by no means un-com-mon to see the needles in the com-pass-es at in-ter-vals go round and round It was thus with the Pe-quod s at al-most ev-ery shock the helms-man had not failed to no-tice the whirling ve-loc-i-ty with which they re-volved up-on the cards it is a sight that hard-ly any-one can be-hold with-out some sort of un-wont-ed emo-tion Some hours af-ter mid-night the Typhoon abat-ed so much that through the stren-u-ous ex-er-tions of Star-buck and Stub-b one en-gaged for-ward and the oth-er af-t the shiv-ered rem-nan-ts of the jib and fore and main top sails were cut adrift from the spars and went ed-dy-ing away to lee-ward like the feath-ers of an al-ba-tross which some-times are cast to the winds when that storm tossed bird is on the wing The three cor-re-spond-ing new sails were now bent and reefed and a storm try-sail was set fur-ther aft so that the ship soon went through the wa-ter with some pre-ci-sion again and the course for the pre-sent East south east which he was to steer if prac-ti-ca-ble was on-ce more given to the helms-man For dur-ing the vi-o-lence of the gale he had on-ly steered ac-cord-ing to its vi-cis-si-tudes But as he was now bring-ing the ship as near her course as pos-si-ble watch-ing the com-pass mean-while lo a good sign the wind seemed com-ing round astern aye the foul breeze be-came fair In-stant-ly the yards were squared to the live-ly song of  Ho the fair wind oh ye ho cheer-ly men  the crew singing for joy that so promis-ing an event should so soon have fal-si-fied the evil por-ten-ts pre-ced-ing it In com-pli-ance with the stand-ing or-der of his com-man-der to re-port im-me-di-ate-ly and at any one of the twen-ty four hours any de-cid-ed change in the af-fairs of the deck  Star-buck had no soon-er trimmed the yards to the breeze how-ev-er re-luc-tant-ly and gloomi-ly  than he me-chan-i-cal-ly went be-low to ap-prise Cap-tain Ahab of the cir-cum-stance Ere knock-ing at his state room he in-vol-un-tar-i-ly paused be-fore it a mo-ment The cab-in lam-p tak-ing long swings this way and that was burn-ing fit-ful-ly and cast-ing fit-ful shad-ows up-on the old man s bolt-ed door  a thin one with fixed blinds in-sert-ed in place of up-per pan-els The iso-lat-ed sub-ter-ra-ne-ous-ness of the cab-in made a cer-tain hum-ming si-lence to reign there though it was hooped round by all the roar of the el-e-men-ts The load-ed mus-kets in the rack were shin-ing-ly re-vealed as they stood up-right again-st the for-ward bulk-head Star-buck was an hon-est up-right man but out of Star-buck s heart at that in-stant when he saw the mus-kets there strange-ly evolved an evil thought but so blent with its neu-tral or good ac-com-pa-ni-men-ts that for the in-stant he hard-ly knew it for it-self  He would have shot me on-ce  he mur-mured  yes there s the very mus-ket that he point-ed at me  that one with the stud-ded stock let me touch it lift it Strange that I who have han-dled so many dead-ly lances strange that I should shake so now Load-ed I must see Aye aye and pow-der in the pan  that s not good Best spill it  wait I ll cure my-self of this I ll hold the mus-ket bold-ly while I think  I come to re-port a fair wind to him But how fair Fair for death and doom  that s fair for Moby Dick It s a fair wind that s on-ly fair for that ac-cursed fish  The very tube he point-ed at me  the very one this one I hold it here he would have killed me with the very thing I han-dle now  Aye and he would fain kill all his crew Does he not say he will not strike his spars to any gale Has he not dashed his heav-en-ly quad-rant and in the-se same per-ilous seas gropes he not his way by mere dead reck-on-ing of the er-ror abound-ing log and in this very Typhoon did he not swear that he would have no light-ning rods But shall this crazed old man be tame-ly suf-fered to drag a whole ship s com-pa-ny down to doom with him  Yes it would make him the wil-ful mur-derer of thir-ty men and more if this ship come to any dead-ly harm and come to dead-ly harm my soul swears this ship will if Ahab have his way If then he were this in-stan-t put aside that crime would not be his Ha is he mut-ter-ing in his sleep Yes just there  in there he s sleep-ing Sleep-ing aye but still alive and soon awake again I can t with-stand thee then old man Not rea-son-ing not re-mon-strance not en-treaty wilt thou hear-ken to all this thou scornest Flat obe-di-ence to thy own flat com-mands this is all thou breathest Aye and say st the men have vow d thy vow say st all of us are Ahabs Great God for-bid  But is there no oth-er way no law-ful way  Make him a pris-on-er to be tak-en home What hope to wrest this old man s liv-ing pow-er from his own liv-ing hands On-ly a fool would try it Say he were pin-ioned even knot-ted all over with ropes and hawsers chained down to ring bolts on this cab-in floor he would be more hideous than a caged tiger then I could not en-dure the sight could not pos-si-bly fly his howl-ings all com-fort sleep it-self in-es-timable rea-son would leave me on the long in-tol-er-a-ble voy-age What then re-mains The land is hun-dreds of leagues away and locked Ja-pan the near-est I stand alone here up-on an open sea with two oceans and a whole con-ti-nent be-tween me and law  Aye aye  tis so  Is heav-en a mur-derer when its light-ning strikes a would be mur-derer in his bed tin-der-ing sheets and skin to-geth-er  And would I be a mur-derer then if  and slow-ly stealthi-ly and half side-ways look-ing he placed the load-ed mus-ket s end again-st the door  On this lev-el Ahab s ham-mock swings with-in his head this way A touch and Star-buck may sur-vive to hug his wife and child again  Oh Mary Mary  boy boy boy  But if I wake thee not to death old man who can tell to what un-sound-ed deeps Star-buck s body this day week may sink with all the crew Great God where art Thou Shall I shall I  The wind has gone down and shift-ed sir the fore and main top-sails are reefed and set she heads her course   Stern all Oh Moby Dick I clutch thy heart at last  Such were the sounds that now came hurtling from out the old man s tor-ment-ed sleep as if Star-buck s voice had caused the long dumb dream to speak The yet lev-elled mus-ket shook like a drunk-ard s arm again-st the pan-el Star-buck seemed wrestling with an an-gel but turn-ing from the door he placed the death tube in its rack and left the place  He s too sound asleep Mr Stubb go thou down and wake him and tell him I must see to the deck here Thou know st what to say  CHAPTER 124 The Needle Next morn-ing the not yet sub-sid-ed sea rolled in long slow bil-lows of mighty bulk and striv-ing in the Pe-quod s gur-gling track pushed her on like gi-ants palms out-spread The strong un-stag-ger-ing breeze abound-ed so that sky and air seemed vast out-bel-ly-ing sails the whole world boomed be-fore the wind Muf-fled in the full morn-ing light the in-vis-i-ble sun was on-ly known by the spread in-ten-si-ty of his place where his bay-o-net rays moved on in stacks Em-bla-zon-ings as of crowned Baby-lo-ni-an kings and queens reigned over ev-ery-thing The sea was as a cru-cible of molten gold that bub-bling-ly leaps with light and heat Long main-tain-ing an en-chant-ed si-lence Ahab stood apart and ev-ery time the teter-ing ship low-er-ing-ly pitched down her bowsprit he turned to eye the bright sun s rays pro-duced ahead and when she pro-found-ly set-tled by the stern he turned be-hind and saw the sun s rear-ward place and how the same yel-low rays were blend-ing with his un-de-vi-at-ing wake  Ha ha my ship thou might-est well be tak-en now for the sea char-i-ot of the sun Ho ho all ye na-tions be-fore my prow I bring the sun to ye Yoke on the fur-ther bil-lows hal-lo a tandem I drive the sea  But sud-den-ly reined back by some coun-ter thought he hur-ried to-wards the helm huski-ly de-mand-ing how the ship was head-ing  East sou east sir  said the fright-ened steers-man  Thou li-est  smit-ing him with his clenched fist  Head-ing East at this hour in the morn-ing and the sun astern  Upon this ev-ery soul was con-found-ed for the phe-nomenon just then ob-served by Ahab had un-ac-count-ably es-caped ev-ery one else but its very blind-ing pal-pa-ble-ness must have been the cause Thrust-ing his head half way in-to the bin-na-cle Ahab caught one glimpse of the com-pass-es his up-lift-ed arm slow-ly fell for a mo-ment he al-most seemed to stag-ger Stand-ing be-hind him Star-buck looked and lo the two com-pass-es point-ed East and the Pe-quod was as in-fal-li-bly go-ing West But ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew the old man with a rigid laugh ex-claimed  I have it It has hap-pened be-fore Mr Star-buck last night s thun-der turned our com-pass-es that s all Thou hast be-fore now heard of such a thing I take it   Aye but nev-er be-fore has it hap-pened to me sir  said the pale mate gloomi-ly Here it must needs be said that ac-ci-den-ts like this have in more than one case oc-curred to ships in vi-o-lent stor-ms The mag-net-ic en-er-gy as de-vel-oped in the mariner s needle is as all know es-sen-tial-ly one with the elec-tric-i-ty be-held in heav-en hence it is not to be much mar-velled at that such things should be In-stances where the light-ning has ac-tu-al-ly struck the ves-sel so as to smite down some of the spars and rig-ging the ef-fect up-on the needle has at times been still more fa-tal all its load-stone virtue be-ing an-ni-hi-lat-ed so that the be-fore mag-net-ic steel was of no more use than an old wife s knit-ting needle But in ei-ther case the needle nev-er again of it-self re-cov-ers the orig-i-nal virtue thus marred or lost and if the bin-na-cle com-pass-es be af-fect-ed the same fate reach-es all the oth-ers that may be in the ship even were the low-er-most one in-sert-ed in-to the kel-son De-lib-er-ate-ly stand-ing be-fore the bin-na-cle and eye-ing the trans-point-ed com-pass-es the old man with the sharp of his ex-tend-ed hand now took the pre-cise bear-ing of the sun and sat-is-fied that the needles were ex-act-ly in-vert-ed shout-ed out his or-ders for the ship s course to be changed ac-cord-ing-ly The yards were hard up and on-ce more the Pe-quod thrust her un-daunt-ed bows in-to the op-pos-ing wind for the sup-posed fair one had on-ly been jug-gling her Mean-while what-ev-er were his own se-cret thoughts Star-buck said noth-ing but qui-et-ly he is-sued all req-ui-site or-ders while Stubb and Flask who in some small de-gree seemed then to be shar-ing his feel-ings like-wise un-mur-mur-ing-ly ac-qui-esced As for the men though some of them low-ly rum-bled their fear of Ahab was greater than their fear of Fate But as ev-er be-fore the pa-gan har-pooneers re-mained al-most whol-ly unim-pressed or if im-pressed it was on-ly with a cer-tain mag-netism shot in-to their con-ge-nial hearts from in-flex-i-ble Ahab s For a space the old man walked the deck in rolling rever-ies But chanc-ing to slip with his ivory heel he saw the crushed cop-per sight tubes of the quad-rant he had the day be-fore dashed to the deck  Thou poor proud heav-en gaz-er and sun s pi-lot yes-ter-day I wrecked thee and to day the com-pass-es would fain have wrecked me So so But Ahab is lord over the lev-el load-stone yet Mr Star-buck a lance with-out a pole a top maul and the small-est of the sail mak-er s needles Quick  Ac-ces-so-ry per-haps to the im-pulse dic-tat-ing the thing he was now about to do were cer-tain pru-den-tial mo-tives whose ob-ject might have been to re-vive the spir-its of his crew by a stroke of his sub-tile skill in a mat-ter so won-drous as that of the in-vert-ed com-pass-es Be-sides the old man well knew that to steer by trans-point-ed needles though clum-si-ly prac-ti-ca-ble was not a thing to be passed over by su-per-sti-tious sailors with-out some shud-der-ings and evil por-ten-ts  Men  said he steadi-ly turn-ing up-on the crew as the mate hand-ed him the things he had de-mand-ed  my men the thun-der turned old Ahab s needles but out of this bit of steel Ahab can make one of his own that will point as true as any  Abashed glances of servile won-der were ex-changed by the sailors as this was said and with fas-ci-nat-ed eyes they await-ed what-ev-er mag-ic might fol-low But Star-buck looked away With a blow from the top maul Ahab knocked off the steel head of the lance and then hand-ing to the mate the long iron rod re-main-ing bade him hold it up-right with-out its touch-ing the deck Then with the maul af-ter re-peat-ed-ly smit-ing the up-per end of this iron rod he placed the blunt-ed needle end-wise on the top of it and less strong-ly ham-mered that sev-er-al times the mate still hold-ing the rod as be-fore Then go-ing through some small strange mo-tions with it whether in-dis-pens-able to the mag-ne-tiz-ing of the steel or mere-ly in-tend-ed to aug-ment the awe of the crew is un-cer-tain he called for linen thread and mov-ing to the bin-na-cle slipped out the two re-versed needles there and hor-i-zon-tal-ly sus-pend-ed the sail needle by its mid-dle over one of the com-pass cards At first the steel went round and round quiv-er-ing and vi-brat-ing at ei-ther end but at last it set-tled to its place when Ahab who had been in-tent-ly watch-ing for this re-sult stepped frankly back from the bin-na-cle and point-ing his stretched arm to-wards it ex-claimed   Look ye for your-selves if Ahab be not lord of the lev-el load-stone The sun is East and that com-pass swears it  One af-ter an-oth-er they peered in for noth-ing but their own eyes could per-suade such ig-no-rance as theirs and one af-ter an-oth-er they slunk away In his fiery eyes of scorn and tri-umph you then saw Ahab in all his fa-tal pride CHAPTER 125 The Log and Line While now the fat-ed Pe-quod had been so long afloat this voy-age the log and line had but very sel-dom been in use Owing to a con-fi-dent re-liance up-on oth-er means of de-ter-min-ing the ves-sel s place some mer-chant-men and many whale-men es-pe-cial-ly when cruis-ing whol-ly ne-glect to heave the log though at the same time and fre-quent-ly more for for-m s sake than any-thing else reg-u-lar-ly putting down up-on the cus-tom-ary slate the course steered by the ship as well as the pre-sumed av-er-age rate of pro-gres-sion ev-ery hour It had been thus with the Pe-quod The wood-en reel and an-gu-lar log at-tached hung long un-touched just be-neath the rail-ing of the af-ter bul-warks Rains and spray had damped it sun and wind had warped it all the el-e-men-ts had com-bined to rot a thing that hung so idly But heed-less of all this his mood seized Ahab as he hap-pened to glance up-on the reel not many hours af-ter the mag-net scene and he re-mem-bered how his quad-rant was no more and re-called his fran-tic oath about the lev-el log and line The ship was sail-ing plung-ing-ly astern the bil-lows rolled in ri-ots  For-ward there Heave the log  Two sea-men came The gold-en hued Tahi-tian and the griz-zly Manx-man  Take the reel one of ye I ll heave  They went to-wards the ex-treme stern on the ship s lee side where the deck with the oblique en-er-gy of the wind was now al-most dip-ping in-to the creamy side-long rush-ing sea The Manx-man took the reel and hold-ing it high up by the pro-ject-ing han-dle ends of the spindle round which the spool of line re-volved so stood with the an-gu-lar log hang-ing down-wards till Ahab ad-vanced to him Ahab stood be-fore him and was light-ly un-wind-ing some thir-ty or forty turns to form a pre-lim-i-nary hand coil to toss over-board when the old Manx-man who was in-tent-ly eye-ing both him and the line made bold to speak  Sir I mis-trust it this line looks far gone long heat and wet have spoiled it    Twill hold old gen-tle-man Long heat and wet have they spoiled thee Thou seem st to hold Or truer per-haps life holds thee not thou it   I hold the spool sir But just as my cap-tain says With the-se grey hairs of mine  tis not worth while dis-put-ing  spe-cial-ly with a su-pe-ri-or who ll ne er con-fess   What s that There now s a patched pro-fes-sor in Queen Na-ture s gran-ite found-ed Col-lege but me-thinks he s too sub-servient Where wert thou born   In the lit-tle rocky Isle of Man sir   Ex-cel-lent Thou st hit the world by that   I know not sir but I was born there   In the Isle of Man hey Well the oth-er way it s good Here s a man from Man a man born in on-ce in-de-pen-dent Man and now un-manned of Man which is sucked in by what Up with the reel The dead blind wall but-ts all in-quir-ing heads at last Up with it So  The log was heaved The loose coils rapid-ly straight-ened out in a long drag-ging line astern and then in-stant-ly the reel be-gan to whirl In turn jerk-ing-ly raised and low-ered by the rolling bil-lows the tow-ing re-sis-tance of the log caused the old reel-man to stag-ger strange-ly  Hold hard  Snap the over-strained line sagged down in one long fes-toon the tug-ging log was gone  I crush the quad-rant the thun-der turns the needles and now the mad sea parts the log line But Ahab can mend all Haul in here Tahi-tian reel up Manx-man And look ye let the car-pen-ter make an-oth-er log and mend thou the line See to it   There he goes now to him noth-ing s hap-pened but to me the skew-er seems loos-en-ing out of the mid-dle of the world Haul in haul in Tahi-tian Th-e-se lines run whole and whirling out come in bro-ken and drag-ging slow Ha Pip come to help eh Pip   Pip whom call ye Pip Pip jumped from the whale boat Pip s miss-ing

hatch-et a hatch-et cut it of-f we haul in no cow-ards here Cap-tain Ahab sir sir here s Pip try-ing to get on board again   Peace thou crazy loon  cried the Manx-man seiz-ing him by the arm  Away from the quar-ter deck   The greater id-iot ev-er scolds the lesser  mut-tered Ahab ad-vanc-ing  Hands off from that ho-li-ness Where sayest thou Pip was boy  Astern there sir astern Lo lo   And who

Ah now had poor Pip but felt so kind a thing as this per-haps he had ne er been lost This seems to me sir as a man rope some-thing that weak souls may hold by Oh sir let old Perth now come and riv-et

Lo ye be-liev-ers in gods all good-ness and in man all ill lo you see the om-ni-scient gods obliv-i-ous of suf-fer-ing man and man though id-i-otic and know-ing not what he does yet full of the sweet things of love and grat-i-tude Come I feel proud-er lead-ing thee by thy black hand than though I grasped an Em-per-or s   There go two daft ones now  mut-tered the old Manx-man  One daft with strength the oth-er daft with weak-ness But here s the end of the rot-ten line all drip-ping too Mend it eh I think we had best have a new line al-to-geth-er I ll see Mr Stubb about it  CHAPTER 126 The Life Buoy Steer-ing now south east-ward by Ahab s lev-elled steel and her pro-gress sole-ly de-ter-mined by Ahab s lev-el log and line the Pe-quod held on her path to-wards the Equa-tor Mak-ing so long a pas-sage through such un-fre-quent-ed wa-ters de-scry-ing no ships and ere long side-ways im-pelled by un-vary-ing trade winds over waves monotonous-ly mild all the-se seemed the strange calm things pre-lud-ing some ri-otous and des-per-ate scene At last when the ship drew near to the out-skirts as it were of the Equa-to-ri-al fish-ing ground and in the deep dark-ness that goes be-fore the dawn was sail-ing by a clus-ter of rocky islets the watch then head-ed by Flask was star-tled by a cry so plain-tive-ly wild and un-earth-ly like half ar-tic-u-lat-ed wail-ings of the ghosts of all Herod s mur-dered In-no-cents that one and all they start-ed from their rever-ies and for the space of some mo-men-ts stood or sat or leaned all trans-fixed-ly lis-ten-ing like the carved Ro-man slave while that wild cry re-mained with-in hear-ing The Chris-tian or civ-i-lized part of the crew said it was mer-maids and shud-dered but the pa-gan har-pooneers re-mained un-ap-palled Yet the grey Manx-man the old-est mariner of al-l de-clared that the wild thrilling sounds that were heard were the voic-es of new-ly drowned men in the sea Below in his ham-mock Ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn when he came to the deck it was then re-count-ed to him by Flask not un-ac-com-pa-nied with hint-ed dark mean-ings He hol-low-ly laughed and thus ex-plained the won-der Those rocky is-lands the ship had passed were the re-sort of great num-bers of seals and some young seals that had lost their dams or some dams that had lost their cubs must have risen nigh the ship and kept com-pa-ny with her cry-ing and sob-bing with their hu-man sort of wail But this on-ly the more af-fect-ed some of them be-cause most mariners cher-ish a very su-per-sti-tious feel-ing about seals aris-ing not on-ly from their pe-cu-liar tones when in dis-tress but al-so from the hu-man look of their round heads and semi in-tel-li-gent faces seen peer-ing-ly up-ris-ing from the wa-ter alongside In the sea un-der cer-tain cir-cum-stances seals have more than on-ce been mis-tak-en for men But the bod-ings of the crew were des-tined to re-ceive a most plau-si-ble con-fir-ma-tion in the fate of one of their num-ber that morn-ing At sun rise this man went from his ham-mock to his mast head at the fore and whether it was that he was not yet half waked from his sleep for sailors some-times go aloft in a tran-si-tion state whether it was thus with the man there is now no telling but be that as it may he had not been long at his per-ch when a cry was heard a cry and a rush-ing and look-ing up they saw a falling phan-tom in the air and look-ing down a lit-tle tossed heap of white bub-bles in the blue of the sea The life buoy a long slen-der cask was dropped from the stern where it al-ways hung obe-di-ent to a cun-ning spring but no hand rose to seize it and the sun hav-ing long beat up-on this cask it had shrunk-en so that it slow-ly filled and that parched wood al-so filled at its ev-ery pore and the stud-ded iron bound cask fol-lowed the sailor to the bot-tom as if to yield him his pil-low though in sooth but a hard one And thus the first man of the Pe-quod that mount-ed the mast to look out for the White Whale on the White Whale s own pe-cu-liar ground that man was swal-lowed up in the deep But few per-haps thought of that at the time In-deed in some sort they were not grieved at this event at least as a por-tent for they re-gard-ed it not as a fore-shad-ow-ing of evil in the fu-ture but as the ful-fil-ment of an evil al-ready pre-saged They de-clared that now they knew the rea-son of those wild shrieks they had heard the night be-fore But again the old Manx-man said nay The lost life buoy was now to be re-placed Star-buck was di-rect-ed to see to it but as no cask of suf-fi-cient light-ness could be found and as in the fever-ish ea-ger-ness of what seemed the ap-proach-ing cri-sis of the voy-age all hands were im-pa-tient of any toil but what was di-rect-ly con-nect-ed with its fi-nal end what-ev-er that might prove to be there-fore they were go-ing to leave the ship s stern un-pro-vid-ed with a buoy when by cer-tain strange signs and in-u-en-does Quee-queg hint-ed a hint con-cern-ing his coffin  A life buoy of a coffin  cried Star-buck start-ing  Rather queer that I should say  said Stubb  It will make a good enough one  said Flask  the car-pen-ter here can ar-range it eas-i-ly   Bring it up there s noth-ing else for it  said Star-buck af-ter a melan-choly pause  Rig it car-pen-ter do not look at me so the coffin I mean Dost thou hear me Rig it   And shall I nail down the lid sir  mov-ing his hand as with a ham-mer  Aye   And shall I caulk the seams sir  mov-ing his hand as with a caulk-ing iron  Aye   And shall I then pay over the same with pitch sir  mov-ing his hand as with a pitch pot  Away what pos-sess-es thee to this Make a life buoy of the coffin and no more  Mr Stubb Mr Flask come for-ward with me   He goes off in a huff The whole he can en-dure at the parts he baulks Now I don t like this I make a leg for Cap-tain Ahab and he wears it like a gen-tle-man but I make a band-box for Quee-queg and he won t put his head in-to it Are all my pains to go for noth-ing with that coffin And now I m or-dered to make a life buoy of it It s like turn-ing an old coat go-ing to bring the flesh on the oth-er side now I don t like this cob-bling sort of busi-ness I don t like it at all it s undig-ni-fied it s not my place Let tin-ker-s brats do tin-ker-ings we are their bet-ters I like to take in hand none but clean vir-gin fair and square math-e-mat-i-cal jobs some-thing that reg-u-lar-ly be-gins at the be-gin-ning and is at the mid-dle when mid-way and comes to an end at the con-clu-sion not a cob-bler s job that s at an end in the mid-dle and at the be-gin-ning at the end It s the old wom-an s tricks to be giv-ing cob-bling jobs Lord what an af-fec-tion all old wom-en have for tin-kers I know an old wom-an of six-ty five who ran away with a bald head-ed young tin-ker on-ce And that s the rea-son I nev-er would work for lone-ly wid-ow old wom-en ashore when I kept my job shop in the Vine-yard they might have tak-en it in-to their lone-ly old heads to run off with me But heigh ho there are no caps at sea but snow caps Let me see Nail down the lid caulk the seams pay over the same with pitch bat-ten them down tight and hang it with the snap spring over the ship s stern Were ev-er such things done be-fore with a coffin Some su-per-sti-tious old car-pen-ters now would be tied up in the rig-ging ere they would do the job But I m made of knot-ty Aroos-t-ook hem-lock I don t budge Crup-pered with a coffin Sail-ing about with a grave yard tray But nev-er mind We work-ers in woods make bridal bed-steads and card ta-bles as well as coffins and hears-es We work by the mon-th or by the job or by the prof-it not for us to ask the why and where-fore of our work un-less it be too con-found-ed cob-bling and then we stash it if we can Hem I ll do the job now ten-der-ly I ll have me let s see how many in the ship s com-pa-ny all told But I ve for-got-ten Any way I ll have me thir-ty sep-a-rate Turk s head-ed life lines each three feet long hang-ing all round to the coffin Then if the hull go down there ll be thir-ty live-ly fel-lows all fight-ing for one coffin a sight not seen very of-ten be-neath the sun Come ham-mer caulk-ing iron pitch pot and mar-ling spike Let s to it  CHAPTER 127 The Deck The coffin laid up-on two line tubs be-tween the vice bench and the open hatch-way the Car-pen-ter caulk-ing its seams the string of twist-ed oakum slow-ly un-wind-ing from a large roll of it placed in the bo-som of his frock  Ahab comes slow-ly from the cab-in gang-way and hears Pip fol-low-ing him  Back lad I will be with ye again present-ly He goes Not this hand com-plies with my hu-mor more ge-nial-ly than that boy  Mid-dle aisle of a church What s here   Life buoy sir Mr Star-buck s or-ders Oh look sir Be-ware the hatch-way   Thank ye man Thy coffin lies handy to the vault   Sir The hatch-way oh So it does sir so it does   Art not thou the leg mak-er Look did not this stump come from thy shop   I be-lieve it did sir does the fer-rule stand sir   Well enough But art thou not al-so the un-der-tak-er   Aye sir I patched up this thing here as a coffin for Quee-queg but they ve set me now to turn-ing it in-to some-thing else   Then tell me art thou not an ar-rant all grasp-ing in-ter-med-dling mo-nop-o-lis-ing hea-then-ish old scamp to be one day mak-ing legs and the next day coffins to clap them in and yet again life buoys out of those same coffins Thou art as un-prin-ci-pled as the gods and as much of a jack of all trades   But I do not mean any-thing sir I do as I do   The gods again Hark ye dost thou not ev-er sing work-ing about a coffin The Ti-tans they say hummed snatch-es when chip-ping out the craters for vol-ca-noes and the grave dig-ger in the play sings spade in hand Dost thou nev-er   Sing sir Do I sing Oh I m in-dif-fer-ent enough sir for that but the rea-son why the grave dig-ger made mu-sic must have been be-cause there was none in his spade sir But the caulk-ing mal-let is full of it Hark to it   Aye and that s be-cause the lid there s a sound-ing board and what in all things makes the sound-ing board is this there s naught be-neath And yet a coffin with a body in it rings pret-ty much the same Car-pen-ter Hast thou ev-er helped car-ry a bier and heard the coffin knock again-st the church-yard gate go-ing in  Faith sir I ve    Faith What s that   Why faith sir it s on-ly a sort of ex-cla-ma-tion like that s all sir   Um um go on   I was about to say sir that    Art thou a silk worm Dost thou spin thy own shroud out of thy-self Look at thy bo-som Des-patch and get the-se traps out of sight   He goes aft That was sud-den now but squalls come sud-den in hot lat-i-tudes I ve heard that the Isle of Albe-mar-le one of the Gal-li-pagos is cut by the Equa-tor right in the mid-dle Seems to me some sort of Equa-tor cuts yon old man too right in his mid-dle He s al-ways un-der the Line fiery hot I tell ye He s look-ing this way come oakum quick Here we go again This wood-en mal-let is the cork and I m the pro-fes-sor of mu-si-cal glass-es tap tap  Ahab to him-self  There s a sight There s a sound The grey-head-ed wood-peck-er tap-ping the hol-low tree Blind and dumb might well be en-vied now See that thing rests on two line tubs full of tow lines A most ma-li-cious wag that fel-low Rat tat So man s sec-onds tick Oh how im-ma-te-ri-al are all ma-te-ri-als What things re-al are there but im-pon-der-able thoughts Here now s the very dread-ed sym-bol of grim death by a mere hap made the ex-pres-sive sign of the help and hope of most en-dan-gered life A life buoy of a coffin Does it go fur-ther Can it be that in some spir-i-tu-al sense the coffin is af-ter all but an im-mor-tal-i-ty pre-server I ll think of that But no So far gone am I in the dark side of earth that its oth-er side the the-o-ret-ic bright one seems but un-cer-tain twi-light to me Will ye nev-er have done Car-pen-ter with that ac-cursed sound I go be-low let me not see that thing here when I re-turn again Now then Pip we ll talk this over I do suck most won-drous philoso-phies from thee Some un-known con-duits from the un-known worlds must emp-ty in-to thee  CHAPTER 128 The Pe-quod Meets The Rachel Next day a large ship the Rachel was de-scried bear-ing di-rect-ly down up-on the Pe-quod all her spars thick-ly clus-ter-ing with men At the time the Pe-quod was mak-ing good speed through the wa-ter but as the broad winged wind-ward stranger shot nigh to her the boast-ful sails all fell to-geth-er as blank blad-ders that are burst and all life fled from the smit-ten hull  Bad news she brings bad news  mut-tered the old Manx-man But ere her com-man-der who with trum-pet to mouth stood up in his boat ere he could hope-ful-ly hail Ahab s voice was heard  Hast seen the White Whale   Aye yes-ter-day Have ye seen a whale boat adrift  Throt-tling his joy Ahab neg-a-tive-ly an-swered this un-ex-pect-ed ques-tion and would then have fain board-ed the stranger when the stranger cap-tain him-self hav-ing stopped his ves-sel s way was seen de-scend-ing her side A few keen pul-ls and his boat hook soon clinched the Pe-quod s main chains and he sprang to the deck Im-me-di-ate-ly he was recog-nised by Ahab for a Nan-tuck-eter he knew But no for-mal salu-ta-tion was ex-changed  Where was he  not killed  not killed  cried Ahab close-ly ad-vanc-ing  How was it  It seemed that some-what late on the af-ter-noon of the day pre-vi-ous while three of the stranger s boats were en-gaged with a shoal of whales which had led them some four or five miles from the ship and while they were yet in swift chase to wind-ward the white hump and head of Moby Dick had sud-den-ly loomed up out of the wa-ter not very far to lee-ward where-upon the fourth rigged boat a re-served one had been in-stant-ly low-ered in chase After a keen sail be-fore the wind this fourth boat the swiftest keeled of al-l seemed to have suc-ceed-ed in fas-ten-ing at least as well as the man at the mast head could tell any-thing about it In the dis-tance he saw the di-min-ished dot-ted boat and then a swift gleam of bub-bling white wa-ter and af-ter that noth-ing more whence it was con-clud-ed that the strick-en whale must have in-def-i-nite-ly run away with his pur-suers as of-ten hap-pens There was some ap-pre-hen-sion but no pos-i-tive alarm as yet The re-call sig-nals were placed in the rig-ging dark-ness came on and forced to pick up her three far to wind-ward boat-s ere go-ing in quest of the fourth one in the pre-cise-ly op-po-site di-rec-tion the ship had not on-ly been ne-ces-si-tat-ed to leave that boat to its fate till near mid-night but for the time to in-crease her dis-tance from it But the rest of her crew be-ing at last safe aboard she crowd-ed all sail stun-sail on stun-sail af-ter the miss-ing boat kin-dling a fire in her try pots for a bea-con and ev-ery oth-er man aloft on the look out But though when she had thus sailed a suf-fi-cient dis-tance to gain the pre-sumed place of the ab-sent ones when last seen though she then paused to low-er her spare boats to pull all around her and not find-ing any-thing had again dashed on again paused and low-ered her boats and though she had thus con-tin-ued do-ing till day-light yet not the least glimpse of the miss-ing keel had been seen The sto-ry told the stranger Cap-tain im-me-di-ate-ly went on to re-veal his ob-ject in board-ing the Pe-quod He de-sired that ship to unite with his own in the search by sail-ing over the sea some four or five miles apart on par-al-lel lines and so sweep-ing a dou-ble hori-zon as it were  I will wa-ger some-thing now  whis-pered Stubb to Flask  that some one in that miss-ing boat wore off that Cap-tain s best coat may-hap his watch he s so cursed anx-ious to get it back Who ev-er heard of two pi-ous whale ships cruis-ing af-ter one miss-ing whale boat in the height of the whal-ing sea-son See Flask on-ly see how pale he look-s pale in the very but-tons of his eye-s look it was-n t the coat it must have been the   My boy my own boy is among them For God s sake I beg I con-jure  here ex-claimed the stranger Cap-tain to Ahab who thus far had but ici-ly re-ceived his pe-ti-tion  For eight and forty hours let me char-ter your ship I will glad-ly pay for it and round-ly pay for it if there be no oth-er way for eight and forty hours on-ly on-ly that you must oh you must and you shall do this thing   His son  cried Stubb  oh it s his son he s lost I take back the coat and watch what says Ahab We must save that boy   He s drowned with the rest on  em last night  said the old Manx sailor stand-ing be-hind them  I heard all of ye heard their spir-its  Now as it short-ly turned out what made this in-ci-dent of the Rachel s the more melan-choly was the cir-cum-stance that not on-ly was one of the Cap-tain s sons among the num-ber of the miss-ing boat s crew but among the num-ber of the oth-er boat s crews at the same time but on the oth-er hand sep-a-rat-ed from the ship dur-ing the dark vi-cis-si-tudes of the chase there had been still an-oth-er son as that for a time the wretched fa-ther was plunged to the bot-tom of the cru-ellest per-plex-i-ty which was on-ly solved for him by his chief mate s in-stinc-tive-ly adopt-ing the or-di-nary pro-ce-dure of a whale ship in such emer-gen-cies that is when placed be-tween jeop-ar-dized but di-vid-ed boats al-ways to pick up the ma-jor-i-ty first But the cap-tain for some un-known con-sti-tu-tion-al rea-son had re-frained from men-tion-ing all this and not till forced to it by Ahab s ici-ness did he al-lude to his one yet miss-ing boy a lit-tle lad but twelve years old whose fa-ther with the earnest but un-mis-giv-ing hardi-hood of a Nan-tuck-eter s pa-ter-nal love had thus ear-ly sought to ini-ti-ate him in the per-ils and won-ders of a vo-ca-tion al-most im-memo-ri-al-ly the des-tiny of all his race Nor does it un-fre-quent-ly oc-cur that Nan-tuck-et cap-tains will send a son of such ten-der age away from them for a pro-tract-ed three or four years voy-age in some oth-er ship than their own so that their first knowl-edge of a whale-man s ca-reer shall be un-en-er-vat-ed by any chance dis-play of a fa-ther s nat-u-ral but un-time-ly par-tial-i-ty or un-due ap-pre-hen-sive-ness and con-cern Mean-time now the stranger was still be-seech-ing his poor boon of Ahab and Ahab still stood like an anvil re-ceiv-ing ev-ery shock but with-out the least quiv-er-ing of his own  I will not go  said the stranger  till you say aye to me Do to me as you would have me do to you in the like case For you too have a boy Cap-tain Ahab though but a child and nestling safe-ly at home now a child of your old age too Yes yes you re-lent I see it run run men now and stand by to square in the yards   Avast  cried Ahab  touch not a rope yarn then in a voice that pro-long-ing-ly mould-ed ev-ery word  Cap-tain Gar-diner I will not do it Even now I lose time Good bye good bye God bless ye man and may I for-give my-self but I must go Mr Star-buck look at the bin-na-cle watch and in three min-utes from this pre-sent in-stant warn off all strangers then brace for-ward again and let the ship sail as be-fore  Hur-ried-ly turn-ing with avert-ed face he de-scend-ed in-to his cab-in leav-ing the strange cap-tain trans-fixed at this un-con-di-tion-al and ut-ter re-jec-tion of his so earnest suit But start-ing from his en-chant-ment Gar-diner silent-ly hur-ried to the side more fell than stepped in-to his boat and re-turned to his ship Soon the two ships di-verged their wakes and long as the strange ves-sel was in view she was seen to yaw hith-er and thith-er at ev-ery dark spot how-ev-er small on the sea This way and that her yards were swung round star-board and lar-board she con-tin-ued to tack now she beat again-st a head sea and again it pushed her be-fore it while all the while her mas-ts and yards were thick-ly clus-tered with men as three tall cher-ry trees when the boys are cher-ry-ing among the boughs But by her still halt-ing course and wind-ing woe-ful way you plain-ly saw that this ship that so wept with spray still re-mained with-out com-fort She was Rachel weep-ing for her chil-dren be-cause they were not CHAPTER 129 The Cabin Ahab mov-ing to go on deck Pip catch-es him by the hand to fol-low  Lad lad I tell thee thou must not fol-low Ahab now The hour is com-ing when Ahab would not scare thee from him yet would not have thee by him There is that in thee poor lad which I feel too cur-ing to my mal-a-dy Like cures like and for this hunt my mal-a-dy be-comes my most de-sired health Do thou abide be-low here where they shall serve thee as if thou wert the cap-tain Aye lad thou shalt sit here in my own screwed chair an-oth-er screw to it thou must be   No no no ye have not a whole body sir do ye but use poor me for your one lost leg on-ly tread up-on me sir I ask no more so I re-main a part of ye   Oh spite of mil-lion vil-lains this makes me a big-ot in the fade-less fi-deli-ty of man  and a black and crazy  but me-thinks like cures like ap-plies to him too he grows so sane again   They tell me sir that Stubb did on-ce de-sert poor lit-tle Pip whose drowned bones now show white for all the black-ness of his liv-ing skin But I will nev-er de-sert ye sir as Stubb did him Sir I must go with ye   If thou speakest thus to me much more Ahab s pur-pose keels up in him I tell thee no it can-not be   Oh good mas-ter mas-ter mas-ter  Weep so and I will mur-der thee have a care for Ahab too is mad Lis-ten and thou wilt of-ten hear my ivory foot up-on the deck and still know that I am there And now I quit thee Thy hand  Met True art thou lad as the cir-cum-fer-ence to its cen-tre So God for ev-er bless thee and if it come to that  God for ev-er save thee let what will be-fall  Ahab goes Pip steps one step for-ward  Here he this in-stant stood I stand in his air  but I m alone Now were even poor Pip here I could en-dure it but he s miss-ing Pip Pip Ding dong ding Who s seen Pip He must be up here let s try the door What nei-ther lock nor bolt nor bar and yet there s no open-ing it It must be the spell he told me to stay here Aye and told me this screwed chair was mine Here then I ll seat me again-st the tran-som in the ship s full mid-dle all her keel and her three mas-ts be-fore me Here our old sailors say in their black sev-en-ty fours great ad-mi-rals some-times sit at table and lord it over rows of cap-tains and lieu-tenan-ts Ha what s this epaulets epaulets the epaulets all come crowd-ing Pass round the de-canters glad to see ye fill up mon-sieurs What an odd feel-ing now when a black boy s host to white men with gold lace up-on their coats  Mon-sieurs have ye seen one Pip  a lit-tle ne-gro lad five feet high hang dog look and cow-ard-ly Jumped from a whale boat on-ce  seen him No Well then fill up again cap-tains and let s drink shame up-on all cow-ards I name no names Shame up-on them Put one foot up-on the table Shame up-on all cow-ards  Hist above there I hear ivory Oh mas-ter mas-ter I am in-deed down heart-ed when you walk over me But here I ll stay though this stern strikes rocks and they bul-ge through and oys-ters come to join me  CHAPTER 13 The Hat And now that at the prop-er time and place af-ter so long and wide a pre-lim-i-nary cruise Ahab  all oth-er whal-ing wa-ters swep-t seemed to have chased his foe in-to an ocean fold to slay him the more se-cure-ly there now that he found him-self hard by the very lat-i-tude and lon-gi-tude where his tor-ment-ing wound had been in-flict-ed now that a ves-sel had been spo-ken which on the very day pre-ced-ing had ac-tu-al-ly en-coun-tered Moby Dick  and now that all his suc-ces-sive meet-ings with var-i-ous ships con-trast-ing-ly con-curred to show the de-mo-ni-ac in-dif-fer-ence with which the white whale tore his hunters whether sin-ning or sinned again-st now it was that there lurked a some-thing in the old man s eyes which it was hard-ly suf-fer-able for fee-ble souls to see As the un-set-ting po-lar star which through the live-long arc-tic six month-s night sus-tains its pierc-ing steady cen-tral gaze so Ahab s pur-pose now fixed-ly gleamed down up-on the con-stant mid-night of the gloomy crew It dom-i-neered above them so that all their bod-ings doubts mis-giv-ings fears were fain to hide be-neath their souls and not sprout forth a sin-gle spear or leaf In this fore-shad-ow-ing in-ter-val too all hu-mor forced or nat-u-ral van-ished Stubb no more stro-ve to raise a smile Star-buck no more stro-ve to check one Alike joy and sor-row hope and fear seemed ground to finest dust and pow-dered for the time in the clamped mor-tar of Ahab s iron soul Like ma-chi-nes they dumb-ly moved about the deck ev-er con-scious that the old man s despot eye was on them But did you deeply scan him in his more se-cret con-fi-den-tial hours when he thought no glance but one was on him then you would have seen that even as Ahab s eyes so awed the crew s the in-scrutable Parsee s glance awed his or some-how at least in some wild way at times af-fect-ed it Such an added glid-ing strangeness be-gan to in-vest the thin Fedal-lah now such cease-less shud-der-ings shook him that the men looked du-bi-ous at him half un-cer-tain as it seemed whether in-deed he were a mor-tal sub-stance or else a tremu-lous shad-ow cast up-on the deck by some un-seen be-ing s body And that shad-ow was al-ways hov-er-ing there For not by night even had Fedal-lah ev-er cer-tain-ly been known to slum-ber or go be-low He would stand still for hours but nev-er sat or leaned his wan but won-drous eyes did plain-ly say We two watch-men nev-er rest Nor at any time by night or day could the mariners now step up-on the deck un-less Ahab was be-fore them ei-ther stand-ing in his piv-ot hole or ex-act-ly pac-ing the planks be-tween two un-de-vi-at-ing lim-its  the main mast and the mizen or else they saw him stand-ing in the cab-in scut-tle  his liv-ing foot ad-vanced up-on the deck as if to step his hat slouched heav-i-ly over his eyes so that how-ev-er mo-tion-less he stood how-ev-er the days and nights were added on that he had not swung in his ham-mock yet hid-den be-neath that slouch-ing hat they could nev-er tell unerring-ly whether for all this his eyes were re-al-ly closed at times or whether he was still in-tent-ly scan-ning them no mat-ter though he stood so in the scut-tle for a whole hour on the stretch and the un-heed-ed night damp gath-ered in beads of dew up-on that stone carved coat and hat The clothes that the night had wet the next day s sun-shine dried up-on him and so day af-ter day and night af-ter night he went no more be-neath the planks what-ev-er he want-ed from the cab-in that thing he sent for He ate in the same open air that is his two on-ly meals  break-fast and din-ner sup-per he nev-er touched nor reaped his beard which dark-ly grew all gnarled as un-earthed roots of trees blown over which still grow idly on at naked base though per-ished in the up-per ver-dure But though his whole life was now be-come one watch on deck and though the Parsee s mys-tic watch was with-out in-ter-mis-sion as his own yet the-se two nev-er seemed to speak one man to the oth-er un-less at long in-ter-vals some pass-ing un-mo-men-tous mat-ter made it nec-es-sary Though such a po-tent spell seemed se-cret-ly to join the twain open-ly and to the awe struck crew they seemed pole like asun-der If by day they chanced to speak one word by night dumb men were both so far as con-cerned the slight-est ver-bal in-ter-change At times for longest hours with-out a sin-gle hail they stood far part-ed in the starlight Ahab in his scut-tle the Parsee by the main-mast but still fixed-ly gaz-ing up-on each oth-er as if in the Parsee Ahab saw his fore-thrown shad-ow in Ahab the Parsee his aban-doned sub-stance And yet some-how did Ahab in his own prop-er self as dai-ly hourly and ev-ery in-stant com-mand-ing-ly re-vealed to his sub-or-di-nates  Ahab seemed an in-de-pen-dent lord the Parsee but his slave Still again both seemed yoked to-geth-er and an un-seen tyrant driv-ing them the lean shade sid-ing the solid rib For be this Parsee what he may all rib and keel was solid Ahab At the first faintest glim-mer-ing of the dawn his iron voice was heard from aft   Man the mast heads   and all through the day till af-ter sun-set and af-ter twi-light the same voice ev-ery hour at the strik-ing of the helms-man s bell was heard  What d ye see  sharp sharp  But when three or four days had slid-ed by af-ter meet-ing the chil-dren seek-ing Rachel and no spout had yet been seen the mono-ma-ni-ac old man seemed dis-trust-ful of his crew s fi-deli-ty at least of near-ly all ex-cept the Pa-gan har-pooneers he seemed to doubt even whether Stubb and Flask might not will-ing-ly over-look the sight he sought But if the-se sus-pi-cions were re-al-ly his he saga-cious-ly re-frained from ver-bal-ly ex-press-ing them how-ev-er his ac-tions might seem to hint them  I will have the first sight of the whale my-self   he said  Aye Ahab must have the dou-bloon  and with his own hands he rigged a nest of bas-ket-ed bow-li-nes and send-ing a hand aloft with a sin-gle sheaved block to se-cure to the main mast head he re-ceived the two ends of the down-ward reeved rope and at-tach-ing one to his bas-ket pre-pared a pin for the oth-er end in or-der to fas-ten it at the rail This done with that end yet in his hand and stand-ing beside the pin he looked round up-on his crew sweep-ing from one to the oth-er paus-ing his glance long up-on Dag-goo Quee-queg Tashte-go but shun-ning Fedal-lah and then set-tling his firm re-ly-ing eye up-on the chief mate said   Take the rope sir I give it in-to thy hands Star-buck  Then ar-rang-ing his per-son in the bas-ket he gave the word for them to hoist him to his per-ch Star-buck be-ing the one who se-cured the rope at last and af-ter-wards stood near it And thus with one hand cling-ing round the roy-al mast Ahab gazed abroad up-on the sea for miles and miles  ahead astern this side and that  with-in the wide ex-pand-ed cir-cle com-mand-ed at so great a height When in work-ing with his hands at some lofty al-most iso-lat-ed place in the rig-ging which chances to af-ford no foothold the sailor at sea is hoist-ed up to that spot and sus-tained there by the rope un-der the-se cir-cum-stances its fas-tened end on deck is al-ways given in strict charge to some one man who has the spe-cial watch of it Be-cause in such a wilder-ness of run-ning rig-ging whose var-i-ous dif-fer-ent re-la-tions aloft can-not al-ways be in-fal-li-bly dis-cerned by what is seen of them at the deck and when the deck ends of the-se ropes are be-ing ev-ery few min-utes cast down from the fas-ten-ings it would be but a nat-u-ral fa-tal-i-ty if un-pro-vid-ed with a con-stant watch-man the hoist-ed sailor should by some care-less-ness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all swoop-ing to the sea So Ahab s pro-ceed-ings in this mat-ter were not un-usu-al the on-ly strange thing about them seemed to be that Star-buck al-most the one on-ly man who had ev-er ven-tured to op-pose him with any-thing in the slight-est de-gree ap-proach-ing to de-ci-sion one of those too whose faith-ful-ness on the look out he had seemed to doubt some-what  it was strange that this was the very man he should se-lect for his watch-man freely giv-ing his whole life in-to such an oth-er-wise dis-trust-ed per-son s hands Now the first time Ahab was perched aloft ere he had been there ten min-utes one of those red billed sav-age sea hawks which so of-ten fly in-com-modi-ous-ly close round the manned mast heads of whale-men in the-se lat-i-tudes one of the-se birds came wheel-ing and scream-ing round his head in a maze of un-track-ably swift cir-clings Then it dart-ed a thou-sand feet straight up in-to the air then spi-ral-ized down-wards and went ed-dy-ing again round his head But with his gaze fixed up-on the dim and dis-tant hori-zon Ahab seemed not to mark this wild bird nor in-deed would any one else have marked it much it be-ing no un-com-mon cir-cum-stance on-ly now al-most the least heed-ful eye seemed to see some sort of cun-ning mean-ing in al-most ev-ery sight  Your hat your hat sir  sud-den-ly cried the Si-cil-ian sea-man who be-ing post-ed at the mizen mast head stood di-rect-ly be-hind Ahab though some-what low-er than his lev-el and with a deep gulf of air di-vid-ing them But al-ready the sable wing was be-fore the old man s eyes the long hooked bill at his head with a scream the black hawk dart-ed away with his prize An ea-gle flew thrice round Tar-quin s head re-mov-ing his cap to re-place it and there-upon Tanaquil his wife de-clared that Tar-quin would be king of Rome But on-ly by the re-plac-ing of the cap was that omen ac-count-ed good Ahab s hat was nev-er re-stored the wild hawk flew on and on with it far in ad-vance of the prow and at last dis-ap-peared while from the point of that dis-ap-pear-ance a min-ute black spot was dim-ly dis-cerned falling from that vast height in-to the sea CHAPTER 131 The Pe-quod Meets The De-light The in-tense Pe-quod sailed on the rolling waves and days went by the life buoy coffin still light-ly swung and an-oth-er ship most mis-er-ably mis-named the De-light was de-scried As she drew nigh all eyes were fixed up-on her broad beams called shears which in some whal-ing ships cross the quar-ter deck at the height of eight or nine feet serv-ing to car-ry the spare un-rigged or dis-abled boats Upon the stranger s shears were be-held the shat-tered white ribs and some few splin-tered planks of what had on-ce been a whale boat but you now saw through this wreck as plain-ly as you see through the peeled half un-hinged and bleach-ing skele-ton of a horse  Hast seen the White Whale   Look  replied the hol-low cheeked cap-tain from his taffrail and with his trum-pet he point-ed to the wreck  Hast killed him   The har-poon is not yet forged that ev-er will do that  an-swered the oth-er sad-ly glanc-ing up-on a round-ed ham-mock on the deck whose gath-ered sides some noise-less sailors were busy in sewing to-geth-er  Not forged  and snatch-ing Perth s lev-elled iron from the crotch Ahab held it out ex-claim-ing  Look ye Nan-tuck-eter here in this hand I hold his death Tem-pered in blood and tem-pered by light-ning are the-se bar-bs and I swear to tem-per them triply in that hot place be-hind the fin where the White Whale most feels his ac-cursed life   Then God keep thee old man see st thou that  point-ing to the ham-mock  I bury but one of five stout men who were alive on-ly yes-ter-day but were dead ere night On-ly that one I bury the rest were buried be-fore they died you sail up-on their tomb  Then turn-ing to his crew  Are ye ready there place the plank then on the rail and lift the body so then Oh God  ad-vanc-ing to-wards the ham-mock with up-lift-ed hand-s  may the res-ur-rec-tion and the life    Brace for-ward Up helm  cried Ahab like light-ning to his men But the sud-den-ly start-ed Pe-quod was not quick enough to es-cape the sound of the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea not so quick in-deed but that some of the fly-ing bub-bles might have sprin-kled her hull with their ghost-ly bap-tism As Ahab now glid-ed from the de-ject-ed De-light the strange life buoy hang-ing at the Pe-quod s stern came in-to con-spic-u-ous re-lief  Ha yon-der look yon-der men  cried a fore-bod-ing voice in her wake  In vain oh ye strangers ye fly our sad buri-al ye but turn us your taffrail to show us your coffin  CHAPTER 132 The Sym-pho-ny It was a clear steel blue day The fir-ma-men-ts of air and sea were hard-ly sep-a-ra-ble in that all per-vad-ing azure on-ly the pen-sive air was trans-par-ent-ly pure and soft with a wom-an s look and the ro-bust and man like sea heaved with long strong lin-ger-ing swells as Sam-son s chest in his sleep Hither and thith-er on high glid-ed the snow white wings of small un-speck-led birds the-se were the gen-tle thoughts of the fem-i-nine air but to and fro in the deeps far down in the bot-tom-less blue rushed mighty leviathans sword fish and sharks and the-se were the strong trou-bled mur-der-ous think-ings of the mas-cu-line sea But though thus con-trast-ing with-in the con-trast was on-ly in shades and shad-ows with-out those two seemed one it was on-ly the sex as it were that dis-tin-guished them Aloft like a roy-al czar and king the sun seemed giv-ing this gen-tle air to this bold and rolling sea even as bride to groom And at the girdling line of the hori-zon a soft and tremu-lous mo-tion most seen here at the equa-tor de-not-ed the fond throb-bing trust the lov-ing alar-ms with which the poor bride gave her bo-som away Tied up and twist-ed gnarled and knot-ted with wrin-kles hag-gard-ly firm and un-yield-ing his eyes glow-ing like coals that still glow in the ash-es of ru-in un-tot-ter-ing Ahab stood forth in the clear-ness of the morn lift-ing his splin-tered hel-met of a brow to the fair girl s fore-head of heav-en Oh im-mor-tal in-fan-cy and in-no-cen-cy of the azure In-vis-i-ble winged crea-tures that frol-ic all round us Sweet child-hood of air and sky how obliv-i-ous were ye of old Ahab s close coiled woe But so have I seen lit-tle Miri-am and Martha laugh-ing eyed elves heed-less-ly gam-bol around their old sire sport-ing with the cir-cle of singed locks which grew on the marge of that burnt out crater of his brain Slow-ly cross-ing the deck from the scut-tle Ahab leaned over the side and watched how his shad-ow in the wa-ter sank and sank to his gaze the more and the more that he stro-ve to pierce the pro-fun-di-ty But the love-ly aro-mas in that en-chant-ed air did at last seem to dis-pel for a mo-ment the can-ker-ous thing in his soul That glad hap-py air that win-some sky did at last stroke and ca-ress him the step moth-er world so long cru-el for-bid-ding now threw af-fec-tion-ate ar-ms round his stub-born neck and did seem to joy-ous-ly sob over him as if over one that how-ev-er wil-ful and erring she could yet find it in her heart to save and to bless From be-neath his slouched hat Ahab dropped a tear in-to the sea nor did all the Paci-fic con-tain such wealth as that one wee drop Star-buck saw the old man saw him how he heav-i-ly leaned over the side and he seemed to hear in his own true heart the mea-sure-less sob-bing that stole out of the cen-tre of the seren-i-ty around Care-ful not to touch him or be no-ticed by him he yet drew near to him and stood there Ahab turned  Star-buck   Sir   Oh Star-buck it is a mild mild wind and a mild look-ing sky On such a day very much such a sweet-ness as this I struck my first whale a boy har-pooneer of eigh-teen Forty forty forty years ago  ago Forty years of con-tin-u-al whal-ing forty years of pri-va-tion and per-il and storm time forty years on the piti-less sea for forty years has Ahab for-sak-en the peace-ful land for forty years to make war on the hor-rors of the deep Aye and yes Star-buck out of those forty years I have not spent three ashore When I think of this life I have led the des-o-la-tion of soli-tude it has been the ma-soned walled town of a Cap-tain s ex-clu-sive-ness which ad-mits but small en-trance to any sym-pa-thy from the green coun-try with-out oh weari-ness heav-i-ness Guinea coast slav-ery of soli-tary com-mand  when I think of all this on-ly half sus-pect-ed not so keen-ly known to me be-fore and how for forty years I have fed up-on dry salt-ed fare fit em-blem of the dry nour-ish-ment of my soil  when the poorest lands-man has had fresh fruit to his dai-ly hand and bro-ken the world s fresh bread to my mouldy crust-s away whole oceans away from that young girl wife I wed-ded past fifty and sailed for Cape Horn the next day leav-ing but one dent in my mar-riage pil-low wife wife  rather a wid-ow with her hus-band alive Aye I wid-owed that poor girl when I mar-ried her Star-buck and then the mad-ness the fren-zy the boil-ing blood and the smok-ing brow with which for a thou-sand low-er-ings old Ahab has fu-ri-ous-ly foam-ing-ly chased his prey more a de-mon than a man  aye aye what a forty years fool fool old fool has old Ahab been Why this strife of the chase why weary and pal-sy the arm at the oar and the iron and the lance how the richer or bet-ter is Ahab now Be-hold Oh Star-buck is it not hard that with this weary load I bear one poor leg should have been snatched from un-der me Here brush this old hair aside it blinds me that I seem to weep Locks so grey did nev-er grow but from out some ash-es But do I look very old so very very old Star-buck I feel dead-ly faint bowed and humped as though I were Adam stag-ger-ing be-neath the piled cen-turies since Par-adise God God God  crack my heart  stave my brain  mock-ery mock-ery bit-ter bit-ing mock-ery of grey hairs have I lived enough joy to wear ye and seem and feel thus in-tol-er-a-bly old Close stand close to me Star-buck let me look in-to a hu-man eye it is bet-ter than to gaze in-to sea or sky bet-ter than to gaze up-on God By the green land by the bright hearth stone this is the mag-ic glass man I see my wife and my child in thine eye No no stay on board on board  low-er not when I do when brand-ed Ahab gives chase to Moby Dick That haz-ard shall not be thine No no not with the far away home I see in that eye   Oh my Cap-tain my Cap-tain no-ble soul grand old heart af-ter all why should any one give chase to that hat-ed fish Away with me let us fly the-se dead-ly wa-ters let us home Wife and child too are Star-buck s wife and child of his broth-er-ly sis-ter-ly play fel-low youth even as thine sir are the wife and child of thy lov-ing long-ing pa-ter-nal old age Away let us away  this in-stant let me al-ter the course How cheer-i-ly how hi-lar-i-ous-ly O my Cap-tain would we bowl on our way to see old Nan-tuck-et again I think sir they have some such mild blue days even as this in Nan-tuck-et   They have they have I have seen them some sum-mer days in the morn-ing About this time yes it is his noon nap now the boy vi-va-cious-ly wakes sits up in bed and his moth-er tel-ls him of me of can-ni-bal old me how I am abroad up-on the deep but will yet come back to dance him again    Tis my Mary my Mary her-self She promised that my boy ev-ery morn-ing should be car-ried to the hill to catch the first glimpse of his fa-ther s sail Yes yes no more it is done we head for Nan-tuck-et Come my Cap-tain study out the course and let us away See see the boy s face from the win-dow the boy s hand on the hill  But Ahab s glance was avert-ed like a blight-ed fruit tree he shook and cast his last cin-dered ap-ple to the soil  What is it what name-less in-scrutable un-earth-ly thing is it what coz-en-ing hid-den lord and mas-ter and cru-el re-morse-less em-per-or com-mands me that again-st all nat-u-ral lov-ings and long-ings I so keep push-ing and crowd-ing and jam-ming my-self on all the time reck-less-ly mak-ing me ready to do what in my own prop-er nat-u-ral heart I durst not so much as dare Is Ahab Ahab Is it I God or who that lifts this arm But if the great sun move not of him-self but is as an er-rand boy in heav-en nor one sin-gle star can re-volve but by some in-vis-i-ble pow-er how then can this one small heart beat this one small brain think thoughts un-less God does that beat-ing does that think-ing does that liv-ing and not I By heav-en man we are turned round and round in this world like yon-der wind-lass and Fate is the hand-spike And all the time lo that smil-ing sky and this un-sound-ed sea Look see yon Al-bi-core who put it in-to him to chase and fang that fly-ing fish Where do mur-der-ers go man Who s to doom when the judge him-self is dragged to the bar But it is a mild mild wind and a mild look-ing sky and the air smells now as if it blew from a far away mead-ow they have been mak-ing hay some-where un-der the slopes of the An-des Star-buck and the mow-ers are sleep-ing among the new mown hay Sleep-ing Aye toil we how we may we all sleep at last on the field Sleep Aye and rust amid green-ness as last year s scythes flung down and left in the half cut swath-s Star-buck  But blanched to a corpse s hue with de-spair the Mate had stolen away Ahab crossed the deck to gaze over on the oth-er side but start-ed at two re-flect-ed fixed eyes in the wa-ter there Fedal-lah was mo-tion-less-ly lean-ing over the same rail CHAPTER 133 The Chase First Day That night in the mid watch when the old man as his wont at in-ter-val-s stepped forth from the scut-tle in which he leaned and went to his piv-ot hole he sud-den-ly thrust out his face fierce-ly snuff-ing up the sea air as a saga-cious ship s dog will in draw-ing nigh to some bar-barous isle He de-clared that a whale must be near Soon that pe-cu-liar odor some-times to a great dis-tance given forth by the liv-ing sperm whale was pal-pa-ble to all the watch nor was any mariner sur-prised when af-ter in-spect-ing the com-pass and then the dog vane and then as-cer-tain-ing the pre-cise bear-ing of the odor as near-ly as pos-si-ble Ahab rapid-ly or-dered the ship s course to be slight-ly al-tered and the sail to be short-ened The acute pol-i-cy dic-tat-ing the-se move-men-ts was suf-fi-cient-ly vin-di-cat-ed at day-break by the sight of a long sleek on the sea di-rect-ly and length-wise ahead smooth as oil and re-sem-bling in the pleat-ed wa-tery wrin-kles bor-der-ing it the pol-ished metal-lic like marks of some swift tide rip at the mouth of a deep rapid stream  Man the mast heads Call all hands  Thun-der-ing with the but-ts of three clubbed hand-spikes on the fore-castle deck Dag-goo roused the sleep-ers with such judg-ment claps that they seemed to ex-hale from the scut-tle so in-stan-ta-neous-ly did they ap-pear with their clothes in their hands  What d ye see  cried Ahab flat-ten-ing his face to the sky  Noth-ing noth-ing sir  was the sound hail-ing down in re-ply  T gal-lant sails  stun-sails alow and aloft and on both sides  All sail be-ing set he now cast loose the life line re-served for sway-ing him to the main roy-al mast head and in a few mo-men-ts they were hoist-ing him thith-er when while but two thirds of the way aloft and while peer-ing ahead through the hor-i-zon-tal va-can-cy be-tween the main top sail and top gal-lant sail he raised a gull like cry in the air  There she blows  there she blows A hump like a snow hill It is Moby Dick  Fired by the cry which seemed si-mul-ta-ne-ous-ly tak-en up by the three look outs the men on deck rushed to the rig-ging to be-hold the fa-mous whale they had so long been pur-su-ing Ahab had now gained his fi-nal per-ch some feet above the oth-er look outs Tashte-go stand-ing just be-neath him on the cap of the top gal-lant mast so that the In-di-an s head was al-most on a lev-el with Ahab s heel From this height the whale was now seen some mile or so ahead at ev-ery roll of the sea re-veal-ing his high sparkling hump and reg-u-lar-ly jet-ting his silent spout in-to the air To the cred-u-lous mariners it seemed the same silent spout they had so long ago be-held in the moon-l-it At-lantic and In-di-an Oceans  And did none of ye see it be-fore  cried Ahab hail-ing the perched men all around him  I saw him al-most that same in-stant sir that Cap-tain Ahab did and I cried out  said Tashte-go  Not the same in-stant not the same no the dou-bloon is mine Fate re-served the dou-bloon for me I on-ly none of ye could have raised the White Whale first There she blows  there she blows  there she blows There again  there again  he cried in long drawn lin-ger-ing me-thod-ic tones at-tuned to the grad-u-al pro-long-ings of the whale s vis-i-ble jets  He s go-ing to sound In stun-sails Down top gal-lant sails Stand by three boats Mr Star-buck re-mem-ber stay on board and keep the ship Helm there Luff luff a point So steady man steady There go flukes No no on-ly black wa-ter All ready the boats there Stand by stand by Low-er me Mr Star-buck low-er low-er  quick quick-er  and he slid through the air to the deck  He is head-ing straight to lee-ward sir  cried Stubb  right away from us can-not have seen the ship yet   Be dumb man Stand by the braces Hard down the helm  brace up Shiver her  shiv-er her  So well that Boats boats  Soon all the boats but Star-buck s were dropped all the boat sails set all the pad-dles ply-ing with rip-pling swift-ness shoot-ing to lee-ward and Ahab head-ing the on-set A pale death glim-mer lit up Fedal-lah s sunken eyes a hideous mo-tion gnawed his mouth Like noise-less nau-tilus shel-ls their light prows sped through the sea but on-ly slow-ly they neared the foe As they neared him the ocean grew still more smooth seemed draw-ing a car-pet over its waves seemed a noon mead-ow so serene-ly it spread At length the breath-less hunter came so nigh his seem-ing-ly un-sus-pect-ing prey that his en-tire daz-zling hump was dis-tinct-ly vis-i-ble slid-ing along the sea as if an iso-lat-ed thing and con-tin-u-al-ly set in a re-volv-ing ring of finest fleecy green-ish foam He saw the vast in-volved wrin-kles of the slight-ly pro-ject-ing head be-yond Be-fore it far out on the soft Turk-ish rugged wa-ters went the glis-ten-ing white shad-ow from his broad milky fore-head a mu-si-cal rip-pling play-ful-ly ac-com-pa-ny-ing the shade and be-hind the blue wa-ters in-ter-change-ably flowed over in-to the mov-ing val-ley of his steady wake and on ei-ther hand bright bub-bles arose and danced by his side But the-se were bro-ken again by the light toes of hun-dreds of gay fowl soft-ly feath-er-ing the sea al-ter-nate with their fit-ful flight and like to some flag staff ris-ing from the paint-ed hull of an ar-gosy the tall but shat-tered pole of a re-cent lance pro-ject-ed from the white whale s back and at in-ter-vals one of the cloud of soft toed fowls hov-er-ing and to and fro skim-ming like a canopy over the fish silent-ly perched and rocked on this pole the long tail feath-ers stream-ing like pen-nons A gen-tle joy-ous-ness a mighty mild-ness of re-pose in swift-ness in-vest-ed the glid-ing whale Not the white bull Jupiter swim-ming away with rav-ished Europa cling-ing to his grace-ful horns his love-ly leer-ing eyes side-ways in-tent up-on the maid with smooth be-witch-ing fleet-ness rip-pling straight for the nup-tial bow-er in Crete not Jove not that great majesty Supre-me did sur-pass the glo-ri-fied White Whale as he so di-vine-ly swam On each soft side co-in-ci-dent with the part-ed swell that but on-ce leav-ing him then flowed so wide away on each bright side the whale shed off en-tic-ings No won-der there had been some among the hunters who name-less-ly trans-port-ed and al-lured by all this seren-i-ty had ven-tured to as-sail it but had fa-tal-ly found that qui-etude but the ves-ture of tor-na-does Yet calm en-tic-ing calm oh whale thou glidest on to all who for the first time eye thee no mat-ter how many in that same way thou may st have be-jug-gled and de-stroyed be-fore And thus through the serene tran-quil-li-ties of the trop-i-cal sea among waves whose hand clap-pings were sus-pend-ed by ex-ceed-ing rap-ture Moby Dick moved on still with-hold-ing from sight the full ter-rors of his sub-merged trunk en-tire-ly hid-ing the wrenched hideous-ness of his jaw But soon the fore part of him slow-ly rose from the wa-ter for an in-stant his whole mar-bleized body formed a high arch like Vir-gini-a s Nat-u-ral Bridge and warn-ing-ly wav-ing his ban-nered flukes in the air the grand god re-vealed him-self sound-ed and went out of sight Hover-ing-ly halt-ing and dip-ping on the wing the white sea fowls long-ing-ly lin-gered over the ag-i-tat-ed pool that he left With oars apeak and pad-dles down the sheets of their sails adrift the three boats now stil-ly float-ed await-ing Moby Dick s reap-pear-ance  An hour  said Ahab stand-ing root-ed in his boat s stern and he gazed be-yond the whale s place to-wards the dim blue spaces and wide woo-ing va-can-cies to lee-ward It was on-ly an in-stant for again his eyes seemed whirling round in his head as he swept the wa-tery cir-cle The breeze now fresh-ened the sea be-gan to swell  The birds  the birds  cried Tashte-go In long In-di-an file as when herons take wing the white birds were now all fly-ing to-wards Ahab s boat and when with-in a few yards be-gan flut-ter-ing over the wa-ter there wheel-ing round and round with joy-ous ex-pec-tant cries Their vi-sion was keen-er than man s Ahab could dis-cov-er no sign in the sea But sud-den-ly as he peered down and down in-to its depths he pro-found-ly saw a white liv-ing spot no big-ger than a white weasel with won-der-ful celer-i-ty up-ris-ing and mag-ni-fy-ing as it rose till it turned and then there were plain-ly re-vealed two long crooked rows of white glis-ten-ing teeth float-ing up from the undis-cov-er-able bot-tom It was Moby Dick s open mouth and scrolled jaw his vast shad-owed bulk still half blend-ing with the blue of the sea The glit-ter-ing mouth yawned be-neath the boat like an open doored mar-ble tomb and giv-ing one side-long sweep with his steer-ing oar Ahab whirled the craft aside from this tremen-dous ap-pari-tion Then call-ing up-on Fedal-lah to change places with him went for-ward to the bows and seiz-ing Perth s har-poon com-mand-ed his crew to grasp their oars and stand by to stern Now by rea-son of this time-ly spin-ning round the boat up-on its ax-is its bow by an-tic-i-pa-tion was made to face the whale s head while yet un-der wa-ter But as if per-ceiv-ing this stratagem Moby Dick with that ma-li-cious in-tel-li-gence as-cribed to him sidel-ing-ly trans-plant-ed him-self as it were in an in-stant shoot-ing his pleat-ed head length-wise be-neath the boat Through and through through ev-ery plank and each rib it thrilled for an in-stant the whale oblique-ly ly-ing on his back in the man-ner of a bit-ing shark slow-ly and feel-ing-ly tak-ing its bows full with-in his mouth so that the long nar-row scrolled low-er jaw curled high up in-to the open air and one of the teeth caught in a row lock The bluish pearl white of the in-side of the jaw was with-in six inch-es of Ahab s head and reached high-er than that In this at-ti-tude the White Whale now shook the slight cedar as a mild-ly cru-el cat her mouse With unas-ton-ished eyes Fedal-lah gazed and crossed his ar-ms but the tiger yel-low crew were tum-bling over each oth-er s heads to gain the ut-ter-most stern And now while both elas-tic gun-wales were spring-ing in and out as the whale dal-lied with the doomed craft in this dev-il-ish way and from his body be-ing sub-merged be-neath the boat he could not be dart-ed at from the bows for the bows were al-most in-side of him as it were and while the oth-er boats in-vol-un-tar-i-ly paused as be-fore a quick cri-sis im-pos-si-ble to with-stand then it was that mono-ma-ni-ac Ahab fu-ri-ous with this tan-ta-liz-ing vicin-i-ty of his foe which placed him all alive and help-less in the very jaws he hat-ed fren-zied with all this he seized the long bone with his naked hands and wild-ly stro-ve to wrench it from its gripe As now he thus vain-ly stro-ve the jaw slipped from him the frail gun-wales bent in col-lapsed and snapped as both jaws like an enor-mous shears slid-ing fur-ther aft bit the craft com-plete-ly in twain and locked them-selves fast again in the sea mid-way be-tween the two float-ing wrecks Th-e-se float-ed aside the bro-ken ends droop-ing the crew at the stern wreck cling-ing to the gun-wales and striv-ing to hold fast to the oars to lash them across At that pre-lud-ing mo-ment ere the boat was yet snapped Ahab the first to per-ceive the whale s in-tent by the crafty up-rais-ing of his head a move-ment that loosed his hold for the time at that mo-ment his hand had made one fi-nal ef-fort to push the boat out of the bite But on-ly slip-ping fur-ther in-to the whale s mouth and tilt-ing over side-ways as it slipped the boat had shak-en off his hold on the jaw spilled him out of it as he leaned to the push and so he fell flat faced up-on the sea Rip-pling-ly with-draw-ing from his prey Moby Dick now lay at a lit-tle dis-tance ver-ti-cal-ly thrust-ing his ob-long white head up and down in the bil-lows and at the same time slow-ly re-volv-ing his whole spin-dled body so that when his vast wrin-kled fore-head rose some twen-ty or more feet out of the wa-ter the now ris-ing swells with all their con-flu-ent waves daz-zling-ly broke again-st it vin-dic-tive-ly toss-ing their shiv-ered spray still high-er in-to the air So in a gale the but half baf-fled Chan-nel bil-lows on-ly re-coil from the base of the Ed-dy-s-tone tri-umphant-ly to over-leap its sum-mit with their scud This mo-tion is pe-cu-liar to the sperm whale It re-ceives its des-ig-na-tion pitch-pol-ing from its be-ing likened to that pre-lim-i-nary up and down poise of the whale lance in the ex-er-cise called pitch-pol-ing pre-vi-ous-ly de-scribed By this mo-tion the whale must best and most com-pre-hen-sive-ly view what-ev-er ob-jec-ts may be en-cir-cling him But soon re-sum-ing his hor-i-zon-tal at-ti-tude Moby Dick swam swift-ly round and round the wrecked crew side-ways churn-ing the wa-ter in his venge-ful wake as if lash-ing him-self up to still an-oth-er and more dead-ly as-sault The sight of the splin-tered boat seemed to mad-den him as the blood of grapes and mul-ber-ries cast be-fore An-ti-ochus s ele-phan-ts in the book of Mac-cabees Mean-while Ahab half smoth-ered in the foam of the whale s in-so-lent tail and too much of a crip-ple to swim  though he could still keep afloat even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that help-less Ahab s head was seen like a tossed bub-ble which the least chance shock might burst From the boat s frag-men-tary stern Fedal-lah in-cu-ri-ous-ly and mild-ly eyed him the cling-ing crew at the oth-er drift-ing end could not suc-cor him more than enough was it for them to look to them-selves For so re-volv-ing-ly ap-palling was the White Whale s as-pect and so plan-e-tar-i-ly swift the ev-er con-tract-ing cir-cles he made that he seemed hor-i-zon-tal-ly swoop-ing up-on them And though the oth-er boats un-harmed still hov-ered hard by still they dared not pull in-to the ed-dy to strike lest that should be the sig-nal for the in-stant de-struc-tion of the jeop-ar-dized cast-aways Ahab and all nor in that case could they them-selves hope to es-cape With strain-ing eyes then they re-mained on the out-er edge of the dire-ful zone whose cen-tre had now be-come the old man s head Mean-time from the be-gin-ning all this had been de-scried from the ship s mast heads and squar-ing her yards she had borne down up-on the scene and was now so nigh that Ahab in the wa-ter hailed her   Sail on the  but that mo-ment a break-ing sea dashed on him from Moby Dick and whelmed him for the time But strug-gling out of it again and chanc-ing to rise on a tow-er-ing crest he shout-ed   Sail on the whale  Drive him off  The Pe-quod s prows were point-ed and break-ing up the charmed cir-cle she ef-fec-tu-al-ly part-ed the white whale from his vic-tim As he sul-len-ly swam off the boats flew to the res-cue Dragged in-to Stub-b s boat with blood shot blind-ed eyes the white brine cak-ing in his wrin-kles the long ten-sion of Ahab s bod-i-ly strength did crack and help-less-ly he yield-ed to his body s doom for a time ly-ing all crushed in the bot-tom of Stub-b s boat like one trod-den un-der foot of herds of ele-phan-ts Far in-land name-less wails came from him as des-o-late sounds from out ravi-nes But this in-ten-si-ty of his phys-i-cal pros-tra-tion did but so much the more ab-bre-vi-ate it In an in-stan-t s com-pass great hearts some-times con-dense to one deep pang the sum to-tal of those shal-low pains kind-ly dif-fused through fee-bler men s whole lives And so such hearts though sum-ma-ry in each one suf-fer-ing still if the gods de-cree it in their life time ag-gre-gate a whole age of woe whol-ly made up of in-stan-ta-neous in-ten-si-ties for even in their point-less cen-tres those no-ble na-tures con-tain the en-tire cir-cum-fer-ences of in-fe-ri-or souls  The har-poon  said Ahab half way ris-ing and drag-ging-ly lean-ing on one bend-ed ar-m  is it safe   Aye sir for it was not dart-ed this is it  said Stubb show-ing it  Lay it be-fore me  any miss-ing men   One two three four five  there were five oars sir and here are five men   That s good  Help me man I wish to stand So so I see him there there go-ing to lee-ward still what a leap-ing spout  Hands off from me The eter-nal sap runs up in Ahab s bones again Set the sail out oars the helm  It is of-ten the case that when a boat is stove its crew be-ing picked up by an-oth-er boat help to work that sec-ond boat and the chase is thus con-tin-ued with what is called dou-ble banked oars It was thus now But the added pow-er of the boat did not equal the added pow-er of the whale for he seemed to have tre-ble banked his ev-ery fin swim-ming with a ve-loc-i-ty which plain-ly showed that if now un-der the-se cir-cum-stances pushed on the chase would prove an in-def-i-nite-ly pro-longed if not a hope-less one nor could any crew en-dure for so long a pe-ri-od such an un-in-ter-mit-ted in-tense strain-ing at the oar a thing bare-ly tol-er-a-ble on-ly in some one brief vi-cis-si-tude The ship it-self then as it some-times hap-pens of-fered the most promis-ing in-ter-me-di-ate means of over-tak-ing the chase Ac-cord-ing-ly the boats now made for her and were soon swayed up to their cranes the two parts of the wrecked boat hav-ing been pre-vi-ous-ly se-cured by her and then hoist-ing ev-ery-thing to her side and stack-ing her can-vas high up and side-ways out-stretch-ing it with stun sails like the dou-ble joint-ed wings of an al-ba-tross the Pe-quod bore down in the lee-ward wake of Moby Dick At the well known me-thod-ic in-ter-vals the whale s glit-ter-ing spout was reg-u-lar-ly an-nounced from the manned mast heads and when he would be re-port-ed as just gone down Ahab would take the time and then pac-ing the deck bin-na-cle watch in hand so soon as the last sec-ond of the al-lot-ted hour ex-pired his voice was heard   Whose is the dou-bloon now D ye see him  and if the re-ply was No sir straight-way he com-mand-ed them to lift him to his per-ch In this way the day wore on Ahab now aloft and mo-tion-less anon un-rest-ing-ly pac-ing the planks As he was thus walk-ing ut-ter-ing no sound ex-cept to hail the men aloft or to bid them hoist a sail still high-er or to spread one to a still greater breadth thus to and fro pac-ing be-neath his slouched hat at ev-ery turn he passed his own wrecked boat which had been dropped up-on the quar-ter deck and lay there re-versed bro-ken bow to shat-tered stern At last he paused be-fore it and as in an al-ready over cloud-ed sky fresh troops of clouds will some-times sail across so over the old man s face there now stole some such added gloom as this Stubb saw him pause and per-haps in-tend-ing not vain-ly though to evince his own un-abat-ed for-ti-tude and thus keep up a valiant place in his Cap-tain s mind he ad-vanced and eye-ing the wreck ex-claimed  The thistle the ass re-fused it pricked his mouth too keen-ly sir ha ha   What soul-less thing is this that laughs be-fore a wreck Man man did I not know thee brave as fear-less fire and as me-chan-i-cal I could swear thou wert a poltroon Groan nor laugh should be heard be-fore a wreck   Aye sir  said Star-buck draw-ing near   tis a solemn sight an omen and an ill one   Omen omen  the dic-tio-nary If the gods think to speak out-right to man they will hon-or-ably speak out-right not shake their heads and give an old wives dark-ling hint  Be-gone Ye two are the op-po-site poles of one thing Star-buck is Stubb re-versed and Stubb is Star-buck and ye two are all mankind and Ahab stands alone among the mil-lions of the peo-pled earth nor gods nor men his neigh-bors Cold cold I shiv-er  How now Aloft there D ye see him Sing out for ev-ery spout though he spout ten times a sec-ond  The day was near-ly done on-ly the hem of his gold-en robe was rustling Soon it was al-most dark but the look out men still re-mained un-set  Can t see the spout now sir  too dark  cried a voice from the air  How head-ing when last seen   As be-fore sir  straight to lee-ward   Good he will trav-el slow-er now  tis night Down roy-als and top gal-lant stun sails Mr Star-buck We must not run over him be-fore morn-ing he s mak-ing a pas-sage now and may heave to a while Helm there keep her full be-fore the wind  Aloft come down  Mr Stubb send a fresh hand to the fore mast head and see it manned till morn-ing   Then ad-vanc-ing to-wards the dou-bloon in the main mas-t  Men this gold is mine for I earned it but I shall let it abide here till the White Whale is dead and then whoso-ev-er of ye first rais-es him up-on the day he shall be killed this gold is that man s and if on that day I shall again raise him then ten times its sum shall be di-vid-ed among all of ye Away now  the deck is thine sir  And so say-ing he placed him-self half way with-in the scut-tle and slouch-ing his hat stood there till dawn ex-cept when at in-ter-vals rous-ing him-self to see how the night wore on CHAPTER 134 The Chase Se-cond Day At day break the three mast heads were punc-tu-al-ly manned afresh  D ye see him  cried Ahab af-ter al-low-ing a lit-tle space for the light to spread  See noth-ing sir   Turn up all hands and make sail he trav-els faster than I thought for  the top gal-lant sails  aye they should have been kept on her all night But no mat-ter  tis but rest-ing for the rush  Here be it said that this per-ti-na-cious pur-suit of one par-tic-u-lar whale con-tin-ued through day in-to night and through night in-to day is a thing by no means un-prece-dent-ed in the South sea fish-ery For such is the won-der-ful skill pre-science of ex-pe-ri-ence and in-vin-ci-ble con-fi-dence ac-quired by some great nat-u-ral ge-nius-es among the Nan-tuck-et com-man-ders that from the sim-ple ob-ser-va-tion of a whale when last de-scried they will un-der cer-tain given cir-cum-stances pret-ty ac-cu-rate-ly fore-tell both the di-rec-tion in which he will con-tin-ue to swim for a time while out of sight as well as his prob-a-ble rate of pro-gres-sion dur-ing that pe-ri-od And in the-se cas-es some-what as a pi-lot when about los-ing sight of a coast whose gen-er-al trend-ing he well knows and which he de-sires short-ly to re-turn to again but at some fur-ther point like as this pi-lot stands by his com-pass and takes the pre-cise bear-ing of the cape at pre-sent vis-i-ble in or-der the more cer-tain-ly to hit aright the re-mote un-seen head-land even-tu-al-ly to be vis-it-ed so does the fish-er-man at his com-pass with the whale for af-ter be-ing chased and dili-gent-ly marked through sev-er-al hours of day-light then when night ob-scures the fish the crea-ture s fu-ture wake through the dark-ness is al-most as es-tab-lished to the saga-cious mind of the hunter as the pi-lot s coast is to him So that to this hunter s won-drous skill the prover-bial evanes-cence of a thing writ in wa-ter a wake is to all de-sired pur-pos-es well nigh as re-li-able as the stead-fast land And as the mighty iron Le-viathan of the mod-ern rail-way is so fa-mil-iar-ly known in its ev-ery pace that with watch-es in their hands men time his rate as doc-tors that of a baby s pulse and light-ly say of it the up train or the down train will reach such or such a spot at such or such an hour even so al-most there are oc-ca-sions when the-se Nan-tuck-eters time that oth-er Le-viathan of the deep ac-cord-ing to the ob-served hu-mor of his speed and say to them-selves so many hours hence this whale will have gone two hun-dred miles will have about reached this or that de-gree of lat-i-tude or lon-gi-tude But to ren-der this acute-ness at all suc-cess-ful in the end the wind and the sea must be the whale-man s al-lies for of what pre-sent avail to the be-calmed or wind-bound mariner is the skill that as-sures him he is ex-act-ly nine-ty three leagues and a quar-ter from his port In-fer-able from the-se state-men-ts are many col-lat-er-al sub-tile mat-ters touch-ing the chase of whales The ship tore on leav-ing such a fur-row in the sea as when a can-non ball mis-sent be-comes a plough share and turns up the lev-el field  By salt and hemp  cried Stubb  but this swift mo-tion of the deck creeps up one s legs and tin-gles at the heart This ship and I are two brave fel-lows  Ha ha Some one take me up and launch me spine wise on the sea  for by live oaks my spine s a keel Ha ha we go the gait that leaves no dust be-hind   There she blows she blows  she blows  right ahead  was now the mast head cry  Aye aye  cried Stubb  I knew it ye can t es-cape blow on and split your spout O whale the mad fiend him-self is af-ter ye blow your trump blis-ter your lungs  Ahab will dam off your blood as a miller shuts his wa-ter-gate up-on the stream  And Stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew The fren-zies of the chase had by this time worked them bub-bling-ly up like old wine worked anew What-ev-er pale fears and fore-bod-ings some of them might have felt be-fore the-se were not on-ly now kept out of sight through the grow-ing awe of Ahab but they were bro-ken up and on all sides rout-ed as timid prair-ie hares that scat-ter be-fore the bound-ing bison The hand of Fate had snatched all their souls and by the stir-ring per-ils of the pre-vi-ous day the rack of the past night s sus-pense the fixed un-fear-ing blind reck-less way in which their wild craft went plung-ing to-wards its fly-ing mark by all the-se things their hearts were bowled along The wind that made great bel-lies of their sails and rushed the ves-sel on by ar-ms in-vis-i-ble as ir-re-sistible this seemed the sym-bol of that un-seen agen-cy which so en-slaved them to the race They were one man not thir-ty For as the one ship that held them all though it was put to-geth-er of all con-trast-ing things oak and maple and pine wood iron and pitch and hemp yet all the-se ran in-to each oth-er in the one con-crete hull which shot on its way both bal-anced and di-rect-ed by the long cen-tral keel even so all the in-di-vid-u-al-i-ties of the crew this man s val-or that man s fear guilt and guilti-ness all va-ri-eties were weld-ed in-to one-ness and were all di-rect-ed to that fa-tal goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did point to The rig-ging lived The mast heads like the tops of tall palms were out-spread-ing-ly tuft-ed with ar-ms and legs Cling-ing to a spar with one hand some reached forth the oth-er with im-pa-tient wav-ings oth-ers shad-ing their eyes from the vivid sun-light sat far out on the rock-ing yards all the spars in full bear-ing of mor-tals ready and ripe for their fate Ah how they still stro-ve through that in-finite blue-ness to seek out the thing that might de-stroy them  Why sing ye not out for him if ye see him  cried Ahab when af-ter the lapse of some min-utes since the first cry no more had been heard  Sway me up men ye have been de-ceived not Moby Dick casts one odd jet that way and then dis-ap-pears  It was even so in their head-long ea-ger-ness the men had mis-tak-en some oth-er thing for the whale spout as the event it-self soon proved for hard-ly had Ahab reached his per-ch hard-ly was the rope be-layed to its pin on deck when he struck the key note to an or-ches-tra that made the air vi-brate as with the com-bined dis-charges of ri-fles The tri-umphant hal-loo of thir-ty buck-skin lungs was heard as much nearer to the ship than the place of the imag-i-nary jet less than a mile ahead Moby Dick bod-i-ly burst in-to view For not by any calm and in-do-lent spout-ings not by the peace-able gush of that mys-tic foun-tain in his head did the White Whale now re-veal his vicin-i-ty but by the far more won-drous phe-nomenon of breach-ing Ris-ing with his ut-most ve-loc-i-ty from the fur-thest depths the Sperm Whale thus booms his en-tire bulk in-to the pure el-e-ment of air and pil-ing up a moun-tain of daz-zling foam shows his place to the dis-tance of sev-en miles and more In those mo-men-ts the torn en-raged waves he shakes off seem his mane in some cas-es this breach-ing is his act of de-fi-ance  There she breach-es there she breach-es  was the cry as in his im-mea-sur-able brava-does the White Whale tossed him-self salmon like to Heav-en So sud-den-ly seen in the blue plain of the sea and re-lieved again-st the still bluer margin of the sky the spray that he raised for the mo-ment in-tol-er-a-bly glit-tered and glared like a glacier and stood there grad-u-al-ly fad-ing and fad-ing away from its first sparkling in-ten-si-ty to the dim mist-i-ness of an ad-vanc-ing show-er in a vale  Aye breach your last to the sun Moby Dick  cried Ahab  thy hour and thy har-poon are at hand  Down down all of ye but one man at the fore The boats  stand by  Un-mind-ful of the te-dious rope lad-ders of the shrouds the men like shoot-ing stars slid to the deck by the iso-lat-ed back-stays and hal-yards while Ahab less dart-ing-ly but still rapid-ly was dropped from his per-ch  Low-er away  he cried so soon as he had reached his boat a spare one rigged the af-ter-noon pre-vi-ous  Mr Star-buck the ship is thine keep away from the boats but keep near them Low-er all  As if to strike a quick ter-ror in-to them by this time be-ing the first as-sailant him-self Moby Dick had turned and was now com-ing for the three crews Ahab s boat was cen-tral and cheer-ing his men he told them he would take the whale head and head  that is pull straight up to his fore-head  a not un-com-mon thing for when with-in a cer-tain lim-it such a course ex-cludes the com-ing on-set from the whale s side-long vi-sion But ere that close lim-it was gained and while yet all three boats were plain as the ship s three mas-ts to his eye the White Whale churn-ing him-self in-to fu-ri-ous speed al-most in an in-stant as it were rush-ing among the boats with open jaws and a lash-ing tail of-fered ap-palling bat-tle on ev-ery side and heed-less of the irons dart-ed at him from ev-ery boat seemed on-ly in-tent on an-ni-hi-lat-ing each sep-a-rate plank of which those boats were made But skil-ful-ly man uvred in-ces-sant-ly wheel-ing like trained charg-ers in the field the boats for a while elud-ed him though at times but by a plank s breadth while all the time Ahab s un-earth-ly slo-gan tore ev-ery oth-er cry but his to shreds But at last in his un-trace-able evo-lu-tions the White Whale so crossed and re-crossed and in a thou-sand ways en-tan-gled the slack of the three lines now fast to him that they fore-short-ened and of them-selves warped the de-vot-ed boats to-wards the plant-ed irons in him though now for a mo-ment the whale drew aside a lit-tle as if to ral-ly for a more tremen-dous charge Seiz-ing that op-por-tu-ni-ty Ahab first paid out more line and then was rapid-ly haul-ing and jerk-ing in up-on it again hop-ing that way to dis-en-cum-ber it of some snarl-s when lo  a sight more sav-age than the em-bat-tled teeth of sharks Caught and twist-ed corkscrewed in the mazes of the line loose har-poons and lances with all their bristling bar-bs and points came flash-ing and drip-ping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahab s boat On-ly one thing could be done Seiz-ing the boat knife he crit-i-cal-ly reached with-in through and then with-out the rays of steel dragged in the line be-yond passed it in-board to the bows-man and then twice sun-der-ing the rope near the chock-s dropped the in-ter-cept-ed fagot of steel in-to the sea and was all fast again That in-stant the White Whale made a sud-den rush among the re-main-ing tan-gles of the oth-er lines by so do-ing ir-re-sistibly dragged the more in-volved boats of Stubb and Flask to-wards his flukes dashed them to-geth-er like two rolling husks on a surf beat-en beach and then div-ing down in-to the sea dis-ap-peared in a boil-ing mael-strom in which for a space the odor-ous cedar chips of the wrecks danced round and round like the grat-ed nut-meg in a swift-ly stirred bowl of punch While the two crews were yet cir-cling in the wa-ters reach-ing out af-ter the re-volv-ing line tubs oars and oth-er float-ing fur-ni-ture while aslope lit-tle Flask bobbed up and down like an emp-ty vial twitch-ing his legs up-wards to es-cape the dread-ed jaws of sharks and Stubb was lusti-ly singing out for some one to ladle him up and while the old man s line now part-ing ad-mit-ted of his pulling in-to the creamy pool to res-cue whom he could  in that wild si-mul-ta-ne-ous-ness of a thou-sand con-cret-ed per-ils  Ahab s yet un-strick-en boat seemed drawn up to-wards Heav-en by in-vis-i-ble wires  as ar-row like shoot-ing per-pen-dic-u-lar-ly from the sea the White Whale dashed his broad fore-head again-st its bot-tom and sent it turn-ing over and over in-to the air till it fell again gun-wale down-ward-s and Ahab and his men strug-gled out from un-der it like seals from a sea side cave The first up-ris-ing mo-men-tum of the whale mod-i-fy-ing its di-rec-tion as he struck the sur-face in-vol-un-tar-i-ly launched him along it to a lit-tle dis-tance from the cen-tre of the de-struc-tion he had made and with his back to it he now lay for a mo-ment slow-ly feel-ing with his flukes from side to side and when-ev-er a stray oar bit of plank the least chip or crumb of the boats touched his skin his tail swift-ly drew back and came side-ways smit-ing the sea But soon as if sat-is-fied that his work for that time was done he pushed his pleat-ed fore-head through the ocean and trail-ing af-ter him the in-ter-tan-gled lines con-tin-ued his lee-ward way at a trav-eller s me-thod-ic pace As be-fore the at-ten-tive ship hav-ing de-scried the whole fight again came bear-ing down to the res-cue and drop-ping a boat picked up the float-ing mariners tubs oars and what-ev-er else could be caught at and safe-ly land-ed them on her decks Some sprained shoul-ders wrists and an-kles livid con-tu-sions wrenched har-poons and lances in-ex-tri-ca-ble in-tri-ca-cies of rope shat-tered oars and planks all the-se were there but no fa-tal or even se-ri-ous ill seemed to have be-fal-l-en any one As with Fedal-lah the day be-fore so Ahab was now found grim-ly cling-ing to his boat s bro-ken half which af-ford-ed a com-par-a-tive-ly easy float nor did it so ex-haust him as the pre-vi-ous day s mishap But when he was helped to the deck all eyes were fas-tened up-on him as in-stead of stand-ing by him-self he still half hung up-on the shoul-der of Star-buck who had thus far been the fore-most to as-sist him His ivory leg had been snapped off leav-ing but one short sharp splin-ter  Aye aye Star-buck  tis sweet to lean some-times be the lean-er who he will and would old Ahab had leaned of-ten-er than he has   The fer-rule has not stood sir  said the car-pen-ter now com-ing up  I put good work in-to that leg   But no bones bro-ken sir I hope  said Stubb with true con-cern  Aye and all splin-tered to pieces Stubb  d ye see it  But even with a bro-ken bone old Ahab is un-touched and I ac-count no liv-ing bone of mine one jot more me than this dead one that s lost Nor white whale nor man nor fiend can so much as graze old Ahab in his own prop-er and in-ac-ces-si-ble be-ing Can any lead touch yon-der floor any mast scrape yon-der roof  Aloft there which way   Dead to lee-ward sir   Up helm then pile on the sail again ship keep-ers down the rest of the spare boats and rig them Mr Star-buck away and muster the boat s crews   Let me first help thee to-wards the bul-warks sir   Oh oh oh how this splin-ter gores me now Ac-cursed fate that the un-con-quer-able cap-tain in the soul should have such a craven mate   Sir   My body man not thee Give me some-thing for a cane there that shiv-ered lance will do Muster the men Sure-ly I have not seen him yet By heav-en it can-not be  miss-ing  quick call them all  The old man s hint-ed thought was true Upon mus-ter-ing the com-pa-ny the Parsee was not there  The Parsee  cried Stub-b  he must have been caught in    The black vom-it wrench thee  run all of ye above alow cab-in fore-castle find him not gone not gone  But quick-ly they re-turned to him with the tid-ings that the Parsee was nowhere to be found  Aye sir  said Stub-b  caught among the tan-gles of your line I thought I saw him drag-ging un-der   My line my line Gone  gone What means that lit-tle word  What death knell rings in it that old Ahab shakes as if he were the bel-fry The har-poon too  toss over the lit-ter there  d ye see it  the forged iron men the white whale s no no no  blis-tered fool this hand did dart it   tis in the fish  Aloft there Keep him nailed Quick  all hands to the rig-ging of the boat-s col-lect the oars har-pooneers the irons the irons  hoist the roy-als high-er a pull on all the sheets  helm there steady steady for your life I ll ten times girdle the un-mea-sured globe yea and di-ve straight through it but I ll slay him yet   Great God but for one sin-gle in-stant show thy-self  cried Star-buck  nev-er nev-er wilt thou cap-ture him old man In Je-sus name no more of this that s worse than dev-il s mad-ness Two days chased twice stove to splin-ters thy very leg on-ce more snatched from un-der thee thy evil shad-ow gone all good an-gels mob-bing thee with warn-ings  what more would-st thou have  Shall we keep chas-ing this mur-der-ous fish till he swamps the last man Shall we be dragged by him to the bot-tom of the sea Shall we be towed by him to the in-fer-nal world Oh oh  Impi-ety and blas-phe-my to hunt him more   Star-buck of late I ve felt strange-ly moved to thee ev-er since that hour we both saw thou know st what in one an-oth-er s eyes But in this mat-ter of the whale be the front of thy face to me as the palm of this hand a li-p-less un-fea-tured blank Ahab is for ev-er Ahab man This whole ac-t s im-mutably de-creed  Twas re-hearsed by thee and me a bil-lion years be-fore this ocean rolled Fool I am the Fates lieu-tenant I act un-der or-ders Look thou un-der-ling that thou obeyest mine  Stand round me men Ye see an old man cut down to the stump lean-ing on a shiv-ered lance propped up on a lone-ly foot  Tis Ahab his body s part but Ahab s soul s a cen-tipede that moves up-on a hun-dred legs I feel strained half strand-ed as ropes that tow dis-mast-ed frigates in a gale and I may look so But ere I break ye ll hear me crack and till ye hear that know that Ahab s hawser tows his pur-pose yet Believe ye men in the things called omens Then laugh aloud and cry en-core For ere they drown drown-ing things will twice rise to the sur-face then rise again to sink for ev-er-more So with Moby Dick two days he s float-ed to-mor-row will be the third Aye men he ll rise on-ce more  but on-ly to spout his last D ye feel brave men brave   As fear-less fire  cried Stubb  And as me-chan-i-cal  mut-tered Ahab Then as the men went for-ward he mut-tered on  The things called omens And yes-ter-day I talked the same to Star-buck there con-cern-ing my bro-ken boat Oh how valiant-ly I seek to drive out of oth-er-s hearts what s clinched so fast in mine  The Parsee the Parsee  gone gone and he was to go be-fore  but still was to be seen again ere I could per-ish How s that  There s a rid-dle now might baf-fle all the lawyers backed by the ghosts of the whole line of judges  like a hawk s beak it pecks my brain I ll I ll solve it though  When dusk de-scend-ed the whale was still in sight to lee-ward So on-ce more the sail was short-ened and ev-ery-thing passed near-ly as on the pre-vi-ous night on-ly the sound of ham-mers and the hum of the grind-stone was heard till near-ly day-light as the men toiled by lanterns in the com-plete and care-ful rig-ging of the spare boats and sharp-en-ing their fresh weapons for the mor-row Mean-time of the bro-ken keel of Ahab s wrecked craft the car-pen-ter made him an-oth-er leg while still as on the night be-fore slouched Ahab stood fixed with-in his scut-tle his hid he-liotrope glance an-tic-i-pat-ing-ly gone back-ward on its di-al sat due east-ward for the ear-li-est sun CHAPTER 135 The Chase  Third Day The morn-ing of the third day dawned fair and fresh and on-ce more the soli-tary night man at the fore mast head was re-lieved by crowds of the day-light look outs who dot-ted ev-ery mast and al-most ev-ery spar  D ye see him  cried Ahab but the whale was not yet in sight  In his in-fal-li-ble wake though but fol-low that wake that s all Helm there steady as thou goest and hast been go-ing What a love-ly day again were it a new made world and made for a sum-mer house to the an-gels and this morn-ing the first of its throw-ing open to them a fairer day could not dawn up-on that world Here s food for thought had Ahab time to think but Ahab nev-er thinks he on-ly feels feels feels that s tin-gling enough for mor-tal man to think s au-dac-i-ty God on-ly has that right and priv-i-lege Think-ing is or ought to be a cool-ness and a calm-ness and our poor hearts throb and our poor brains beat too much for that And yet I ve some-times thought my brain was very calm frozen calm this old skull cracks so like a glass in which the con-tents turned to ice and shiv-er it And still this hair is grow-ing now this mo-ment grow-ing and heat must breed it but no it s like that sort of com-mon grass that will grow any-where be-tween the earthy clefts of Green-land ice or in Ve-su-vius lava How the wild winds blow it they whip it about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash the tossed ship they cling to A vile wind that has no doubt blown ere this through pris-on cor-ri-dors and cel-ls and wards of hos-pi-tals and ven-ti-lat-ed them and now comes blow-ing hith-er as in-no-cent as fleeces Out up-on it  it s taint-ed Were I the wind I d blow no more on such a wicked mis-er-able world I d crawl some-where to a cave and slink there And yet  tis a no-ble and hero-ic thing the wind who ev-er con-quered it In ev-ery fight it has the last and bit-ter-est blow Run tilt-ing at it and you but run through it Ha a cow-ard wind that strikes stark naked men but will not stand to re-ceive a sin-gle blow Even Ahab is a braver thing a no-bler thing than that Would now the wind but had a body but all the things that most ex-as-per-ate and out-rage mor-tal man all the-se things are bod-i-less but on-ly bod-i-less as ob-jec-ts not as agen-ts There s a most spe-cial a most cun-ning oh a most ma-li-cious dif-fer-ence And yet I say again and swear it now that there s some-thing all glo-ri-ous and gra-cious in the wind Th-e-se warm Trade Winds at least that in the clear heav-ens blow straight on in strong and stead-fast vig-or-ous mild-ness and veer not from their mark how-ev-er the baser cur-ren-ts of the sea may turn and tack and might-i-est Mis-sis-sip-pies of the land swift and swerve about un-cer-tain where to go at last And by the eter-nal Poles the-se same Trades that so di-rect-ly blow my good ship on the-se Trades or some-thing like them some-thing so un-change-able and full as strong blow my keeled soul along To it Aloft there What d ye see   Noth-ing sir   Noth-ing and noon at hand The dou-bloon goes a beg-ging See the sun Aye aye it must be so I ve over-sailed him How got the start Aye he s chas-ing me now not I him  that s bad I might have known it too Fool the lines the har-poons he s tow-ing Aye aye I have run him by last night About about Come down all of ye but the reg-u-lar look outs Man the braces  Steer-ing as she had done the wind had been some-what on the Pe-quod s quar-ter so that now be-ing point-ed in the re-verse di-rec-tion the braced ship sailed hard up-on the breeze as she rechurned the cream in her own white wake  Again-st the wind he now steers for the open jaw  mur-mured Star-buck to him-self as he coiled the new hauled main brace up-on the rail  God keep us but al-ready my bones feel damp with-in me and from the in-side wet my flesh I mis-doubt me that I dis-obey my God in obey-ing him   Stand by to sway me up  cried Ahab ad-vanc-ing to the hempen bas-ket  We should meet him soon   Aye aye sir  and straight-way Star-buck did Ahab s bid-ding and on-ce more Ahab swung on high A whole hour now passed gold beat-en out to ages Time it-self now held long breaths with keen sus-pense But at last some three points off the weath-er bow Ahab de-scried the spout again and in-stant-ly from the three mast heads three shrieks went up as if the tongues of fire had voiced it  Fore-head to fore-head I meet thee this third time Moby Dick On deck there  brace sharper up crowd her in-to the wind s eye He s too far off to low-er yet Mr Star-buck The sails shake Stand over that helms-man with a top maul So so he trav-els fast and I must down But let me have one more good round look aloft here at the sea there s time for that An old old sight and yet some-how so young aye and not changed a wink since I first saw it a boy from the sand hills of Nan-tuck-et The same  the same  the same to Noah as to me There s a soft show-er to lee-ward Such love-ly lee-ward-ings They must lead some-where to some-thing else than com-mon land more palmy than the palms Lee-ward the white whale goes that way look to wind-ward then the bet-ter if the bit-terer quar-ter But good bye good bye old mast head What s this  green aye tiny moss-es in the-se warped cracks No such green weath-er stains on Ahab s head There s the dif-fer-ence now be-tween man s old age and mat-ter s But aye old mast we both grow old to-geth-er sound in our hul-ls though are we not my ship Aye mi-nus a leg that s all By heav-en this dead wood has the bet-ter of my live flesh ev-ery way I can t com-pare with it and I ve known some ships made of dead trees out-last the lives of men made of the most vi-tal stuff of vi-tal fa-thers What s that he said he should still go be-fore me my pi-lot and yet to be seen again But where Will I have eyes at the bot-tom of the sea sup-pos-ing I de-scend those end-less stairs and all night I ve been sail-ing from him wherever he did sink to Aye aye like many more thou told st dire-ful truth as touch-ing thy-self O Parsee but Ahab there thy shot fell short Good bye mast head keep a good eye up-on the whale the while I m gone We ll talk to mor-row nay to night when the white whale lies down there tied by head and tail  He gave the word and still gaz-ing round him was steadi-ly low-ered through the cloven blue air to the deck In due time the boats were low-ered but as stand-ing in his shal-lop s stern Ahab just hov-ered up-on the point of the de-scent he waved to the mate  who held one of the tack-le ropes on deck and bade him pause  Star-buck   Sir   For the third time my soul s ship starts up-on this voy-age Star-buck   Aye sir thou wilt have it so   Some ships sail from their ports and ev-er af-ter-wards are miss-ing Star-buck   Truth sir sad-dest truth   Some men die at ebb tide some at low wa-ter some at the full of the flood  and I feel now like a bil-low that s all one crest-ed comb Star-buck I am old  shake hands with me man  Their hands met their eyes fas-tened Star-buck s tears the glue  Oh my cap-tain my cap-tain  no-ble heart go not go not  see it s a brave man that weeps how great the agony of the per-sua-sion then   Low-er away   cried Ahab toss-ing the mate s arm from him  Stand by the crew  In an in-stant the boat was pulling round close un-der the stern  The sharks the sharks  cried a voice from the low cab-in win-dow there  O mas-ter my mas-ter come back  But Ahab heard noth-ing for his own voice was high lift-ed then and the boat leaped on Yet the voice spake true for scarce had he pushed from the ship when num-bers of sharks seem-ing-ly ris-ing from out the dark wa-ters be-neath the hull ma-li-cious-ly snapped at the blades of the oars ev-ery time they dipped in the wa-ter and in this way ac-com-pa-nied the boat with their bites It is a thing not un-com-mon-ly hap-pen-ing to the whale boats in those swarm-ing seas the sharks at times ap-par-ent-ly fol-low-ing them in the same pre-scient way that vul-tures hov-er over the ban-ners of march-ing reg-i-men-ts in the east But the-se were the first sharks that had been ob-served by the Pe-quod since the White Whale had been first de-scried and whether it was that Ahab s crew were all such tiger yel-low bar-bar-ians and there-fore their flesh more musky to the sens-es of the shark-s a mat-ter some-times well known to af-fect them  how-ev-er it was they seemed to fol-low that one boat with-out mo-lest-ing the oth-ers  Heart of wrought steel  mur-mured Star-buck gaz-ing over the side and fol-low-ing with his eyes the re-ced-ing boat  canst thou yet ring bold-ly to that sight  low-er-ing thy keel among raven-ing sharks and fol-lowed by them open mouthed to the chase and this the crit-i-cal third day  For when three days flow to-geth-er in one con-tin-u-ous in-tense pur-suit be sure the first is the morn-ing the sec-ond the noon and the third the evening and the end of that thing be that end what it may Oh my God what is this that shoots through me and leaves me so dead-ly calm yet ex-pec-tant  fixed at the top of a shud-der Fu-ture things swim be-fore me as in emp-ty out-li-nes and skele-tons all the past is some-how grown dim Mary girl thou fadest in pale glo-ries be-hind me boy I seem to see but thy eyes grown won-drous blue Strangest prob-lems of life seem clear-ing but clouds sweep be-tween Is my jour-ney s end com-ing My legs feel faint like his who has foot-ed it all day Feel thy heart  beats it yet Stir thy-self Star-buck  stave it of-f move move speak aloud  Mast head there See ye my boy s hand on the hill  Crazed  aloft there  keep thy keen-est eye up-on the boats  mark well the whale  Ho again  drive off that hawk see he peck-s he tears the vane  point-ing to the red flag fly-ing at the main truck  Ha he soars away with it  Where s the old man now see st thou that sight oh Ahab  shud-der shud-der  The boats had not gone very far when by a sig-nal from the mast head-s a down-ward point-ed arm Ahab knew that the whale had sound-ed but in-tend-ing to be near him at the next ris-ing he held on his way a lit-tle side-ways from the ves-sel the becharmed crew main-tain-ing the pro-foundest si-lence as the head beat waves ham-mered and ham-mered again-st the op-pos-ing bow  Drive drive in your nails oh ye waves to their ut-ter-most heads drive them in ye but strike a thing with-out a lid and no coffin and no hearse can be mine  and hemp on-ly can kill me Ha ha  Sud-den-ly the wa-ters around them slow-ly swelled in broad cir-cles then quick-ly up-heaved as if side-ways slid-ing from a sub-merged berg of ice swift-ly ris-ing to the sur-face A low rum-bling sound was heard a sub-ter-ra-ne-ous hum and then all held their breaths as bedrag-gled with trail-ing ropes and har-poons and lances a vast form shot length-wise but oblique-ly from the sea Shroud-ed in a thin droop-ing veil of mist it hov-ered for a mo-ment in the rain-bowed air and then fell swamp-ing back in-to the deep Crushed thir-ty feet up-wards the wa-ters flashed for an in-stant like heaps of foun-tains then bro-ken-ly sank in a show-er of flakes leav-ing the cir-cling sur-face creamed like new milk round the mar-ble trunk of the whale  Give way  cried Ahab to the oars-men and the boats dart-ed for-ward to the at-tack but mad-dened by yes-ter-day s fresh irons that cor-rod-ed in him Moby Dick seemed com-bined-ly pos-sessed by all the an-gels that fell from heav-en The wide tiers of weld-ed ten-dons over-spread-ing his broad white fore-head be-neath the trans-par-ent skin looked knit-ted to-geth-er as head on he came churn-ing his tail among the boats and on-ce more flailed them apart spilling out the irons and lances from the two mates boats and dash-ing in one side of the up-per part of their bows but leav-ing Ahab s al-most with-out a scar While Dag-goo and Quee-queg were stop-ping the strained planks and as the whale swim-ming out from them turned and showed one en-tire flank as he shot by them again at that mo-ment a quick cry went up Lashed round and round to the fish s back pin-ioned in the turns up-on turns in which dur-ing the past night the whale had reeled the in-vo-lu-tions of the lines around him the half torn body of the Parsee was seen his sable rai-ment frayed to shreds his dis-tend-ed eyes turned full up-on old Ahab The har-poon dropped from his hand  Be-fooled be-fooled   draw-ing in a long lean breath  Aye Parsee I see thee again  Aye and thou goest be-fore and this this then is the hearse that thou did-st promise But I hold thee to the last let-ter of thy word Where is the sec-ond hearse Away mates to the ship those boats are use-less now re-pair them if ye can in time and re-turn to me if not Ahab is enough to die Down men the first thing that but of-fers to jump from this boat I stand in that thing I har-poon Ye are not oth-er men but my ar-ms and my legs and so obey me  Where s the whale gone down again  But he looked too nigh the boat for as if bent up-on es-cap-ing with the corpse he bore and as if the par-tic-u-lar place of the last en-coun-ter had been but a stage in his lee-ward voy-age Moby Dick was now again steadi-ly swim-ming for-ward and had al-most passed the ship  which thus far had been sail-ing in the con-trary di-rec-tion to him though for the pre-sent her head-way had been stopped He seemed swim-ming with his ut-most ve-loc-i-ty and now on-ly in-tent up-on pur-su-ing his own straight path in the sea  Oh Ahab  cried Star-buck  not too late is it even now the third day to de-sist See Moby Dick seeks thee not It is thou thou that mad-ly seekest him  Set-ting sail to the ris-ing wind the lone-ly boat was swift-ly im-pelled to lee-ward by both oars and can-vas And at last when Ahab was slid-ing by the ves-sel so near as plain-ly to dis-tin-guish Star-buck s face as he leaned over the rail he hailed him to turn the ves-sel about and fol-low him not too swift-ly at a ju-di-cious in-ter-val Glanc-ing up-wards he saw Tashte-go Quee-queg and Dag-goo ea-ger-ly mount-ing to the three mast heads while the oars-men were rock-ing in the two staved boats which had but just been hoist-ed to the side and were busi-ly at work in re-pair-ing them One af-ter the oth-er through the port holes as he sped he al-so caught fly-ing glimpses of Stubb and Flask busy-ing them-selves on deck among bundles of new irons and lances As he saw all this as he heard the ham-mers in the bro-ken boats far oth-er ham-mers seemed driv-ing a nail in-to his heart But he ral-lied And now mark-ing that the vane or flag was gone from the main mast head he shout-ed to Tashte-go who had just gained that per-ch to de-scend again for an-oth-er flag and a ham-mer and nails and so nail it to the mast Whether fagged by the three days run-ning chase and the re-sis-tance to his swim-ming in the knot-ted ham-per he bore or whether it was some la-tent de-ceit-ful-ness and mal-ice in him whichev-er was true the White Whale s way now be-gan to abate as it seemed from the boat so rapid-ly near-ing him on-ce more though in-deed the whale s last start had not been so long a one as be-fore And still as Ahab glid-ed over the waves the un-pity-ing sharks ac-com-pa-nied him and so per-ti-na-cious-ly stuck to the boat and so con-tin-u-al-ly bit at the ply-ing oars that the blades be-came jagged and crunched and left small splin-ters in the sea at al-most ev-ery dip  Heed them not those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars Pull on  tis the bet-ter rest the shark s jaw than the yield-ing wa-ter   But at ev-ery bite sir the thin blades grow small-er and small-er   They will last long enough pull on  But who can tel-l  he mut-tered  whether the-se sharks swim to feast on the whale or on Ahab  But pull on Aye all alive now we near him The helm take the helm let me pass   and so say-ing two of the oars-men helped him for-ward to the bows of the still fly-ing boat At length as the craft was cast to one side and ran rang-ing along with the White Whale s flank he seemed strange-ly obliv-i-ous of its ad-vance as the whale some-times will and Ahab was fair-ly with-in the smoky moun-tain mist which thrown off from the whale s spout curled round his great Mon-ad-nock hump he was even thus close to him when with body arched back and both ar-ms length-wise high lift-ed to the poise he dart-ed his fierce iron and his far fiercer curse in-to the hat-ed whale As both steel and curse sank to the sock-et as if sucked in-to a morass Moby Dick side-ways writhed spas-mod-i-cal-ly rolled his nigh flank again-st the bow and with-out staving a hole in it so sud-den-ly cant-ed the boat over that had it not been for the el-e-vat-ed part of the gun-wale to which he then clung Ahab would on-ce more have been tossed in-to the sea As it was three of the oars-men who foreknew not the pre-cise in-stant of the dart and were there-fore un-pre-pared for its ef-fect-s the-se were flung out but so fell that in an in-stant two of them clutched the gun-wale again and ris-ing to its lev-el on a comb-ing wave hurled them-selves bod-i-ly in-board again the third man help-less-ly drop-ping astern but still afloat and swim-ming Al-most si-mul-ta-ne-ous-ly with a mighty vo-li-tion of un-grad-u-at-ed in-stan-ta-neous swift-ness the White Whale dart-ed through the wel-ter-ing sea But when Ahab cried out to the steers-man to take new turns with the line and hold it so and com-mand-ed the crew to turn round on their seats and tow the boat up to the mark the mo-ment the treach-er-ous line felt that dou-ble strain and tug it snapped in the emp-ty air  What breaks in me Some sinew cracks   tis whole again oars oars Burst in up-on him  Hear-ing the tremen-dous rush of the sea crash-ing boat the whale wheeled round to pre-sent his blank fore-head at bay but in that evo-lu-tion catch-ing sight of the near-ing black hull of the ship seem-ing-ly see-ing in it the source of all his per-se-cu-tions be-think-ing it it may be a larg-er and no-bler foe of a sud-den he bore down up-on its ad-vanc-ing prow smit-ing his jaws amid fiery show-ers of foam Ahab stag-gered his hand smote his fore-head  I grow blind hands stretch out be-fore me that I may yet grope my way Is t night   The whale The ship  cried the cring-ing oars-men  Oars oars Slope down-wards to thy depths O sea that ere it be for ev-er too late Ahab may slide this last last time up-on his mark I see the ship the ship Dash on my men Will ye not save my ship  But as the oars-men vi-o-lent-ly forced their boat through the sledge ham-mer-ing seas the be-fore whale smit-ten bow ends of two planks burst through and in an in-stant al-most the tem-porar-i-ly dis-abled boat lay near-ly lev-el with the waves its half wad-ing splash-ing crew try-ing hard to stop the gap and bale out the pour-ing wa-ter Mean-time for that one be-hold-ing in-stant Tashte-go s mast head ham-mer re-mained sus-pend-ed in his hand and the red flag half wrap-ping him as with a plaid then streamed it-self straight out from him as his own for-ward flow-ing heart while Star-buck and Stubb stand-ing up-on the bowsprit be-neath caught sight of the down com-ing mon-ster just as soon as he  The whale the whale Up helm up helm Oh all ye sweet pow-ers of air now hug me close Let not Star-buck die if die he must in a wom-an s faint-ing fit Up helm I say ye fools the jaw the jaw Is this the end of all my burst-ing prayers all my life long fi-deli-ties Oh Ahab Ahab lo thy work Steady helms-man steady Nay nay Up helm again He turns to meet us Oh his un-ap-peasable brow drives on to-wards one whose du-ty tel-ls him he can-not de-part My God stand by me now   Stand not by me but stand un-der me who-ev-er you are that will now help Stubb for Stubb too sticks here I grin at thee thou grin-ning whale Who ev-er helped Stubb or kept Stubb awake but Stub-b s own un-wink-ing eye And now poor Stubb goes to bed up-on a mat-trass that is all too soft would it were stuffed with brush-wood I grin at thee thou grin-ning whale Look ye sun moon and stars I call ye as-sas-sins of as good a fel-low as ev-er spout-ed up his ghost For all that I would yet ring glass-es with ye would ye but hand the cup Oh oh oh oh thou grin-ning whale but there ll be plen-ty of gulp-ing soon Why fly ye not O Ahab For me off shoes and jack-et to it let Stubb die in his draw-ers A most mouldy and over salt-ed death though  cher-ries cher-ries cher-ries Oh Flask for one red cher-ry ere we die   Cher-ries I on-ly wish that we were where they grow Oh Stubb I hope my poor moth-er s drawn my part pay ere this if not few cop-pers will now come to her for the voy-age is up  From the ship s bows near-ly all the sea-men now hung in-ac-tive ham-mers bits of plank lances and har-poons me-chan-i-cal-ly re-tained in their hands just as they had dart-ed from their var-i-ous em-ploy-men-ts all their en-chant-ed eyes in-tent up-on the whale which from side to side strange-ly vi-brat-ing his pre-des-ti-nat-ing head sent a broad band of over-spread-ing semi-cir-cu-lar foam be-fore him as he rushed Retri-bu-tion swift vengeance eter-nal mal-ice were in his whole as-pect and spite of all that mor-tal man could do the solid white but-tress of his fore-head smote the ship s star-board bow till men and tim-bers reeled Some fell flat up-on their faces Like dis-lodged trucks the heads of the har-pooneers aloft shook on their bull like necks Through the breach they heard the wa-ters pour as moun-tain tor-ren-ts down a flume  The ship The hearse  the sec-ond hearse  cried Ahab from the boat  its wood could on-ly be Amer-i-can  Div-ing be-neath the set-tling ship the whale ran quiv-er-ing along its keel but turn-ing un-der wa-ter swift-ly shot to the sur-face again far off the oth-er bow but with-in a few yards of Ahab s boat where for a time he lay qui-es-cent  I turn my body from the sun What ho Tashte-go let me hear thy ham-mer Oh ye three un-sur-ren-dered spires of mine thou un-cracked keel and on-ly god bul-lied hull thou firm deck and haughty helm and Pole point-ed prow  death glo-ri-ous ship must ye then per-ish and with-out me Am I cut off from the last fond pride of meanest ship-wrecked cap-tains Oh lone-ly death on lone-ly life Oh now I feel my top-most great-ness lies in my top-most grief Ho ho from all your fur-thest bounds pour ye now in ye bold bil-lows of my whole fore-gone life and top this one piled comber of my death Towards thee I roll thou all de-stroy-ing but un-con-quer-ing whale to the last I grap-ple with thee from hel-l s heart I stab at thee for hate s sake I spit my last breath at thee Sink all coffins and all hears-es to one com-mon pool and since nei-ther can be mine let me then tow to pieces while still chas-ing thee though tied to thee thou damned whale Thus I give up the spear  The har-poon was dart-ed the strick-en whale flew for-ward with ig-nit-ing ve-loc-i-ty the line ran through the grooves  ran foul Ahab stooped to clear it he did clear it but the fly-ing turn caught him round the neck and voice-less-ly as Turk-ish mutes bow-string their vic-tim he was shot out of the boat ere the crew knew he was gone Next in-stant the heavy eye splice in the rope s fi-nal end flew out of the stark emp-ty tub knocked down an oars-man and smit-ing the sea dis-ap-peared in its depths For an in-stant the tranced boat s crew stood still then turned  The ship Great God where is the ship  Soon they through dim be-wil-der-ing medi-ums saw her side-long fad-ing phan-tom as in the gaseous Fata Mor-gana on-ly the up-per-most mas-ts out of wa-ter while fixed by in-fat-u-a-tion or fi-deli-ty or fate to their on-ce lofty perch-es the pa-gan har-pooneers still main-tained their sink-ing look-outs on the sea And now con-cen-tric cir-cles seized the lone boat it-self and all its crew and each float-ing oar and ev-ery lance pole and spin-ning an-i-mate and inan-i-mate all round and round in one vor-tex car-ried the small-est chip of the Pe-quod out of sight But as the last whelm-ings in-ter-mix-ing-ly poured them-selves over the sunken head of the In-di-an at the main-mast leav-ing a few inch-es of the erect spar yet vis-i-ble to-geth-er with long stream-ing yards of the flag which calm-ly un-du-lat-ed with iron-i-cal co-in-cid-ings over the de-stroy-ing bil-lows they al-most touched  at that in-stant a red arm and a ham-mer hov-ered back-ward-ly up-lift-ed in the open air in the act of nail-ing the flag faster and yet faster to the sub-sid-ing spar A sky hawk that taunt-ing-ly had fol-lowed the main truck down-wards from its nat-u-ral home among the stars peck-ing at the flag and in-com-mod-ing Tashte-go there this bird now chanced to in-ter-cept its broad flut-ter-ing wing be-tween the ham-mer and the wood and si-mul-ta-ne-ous-ly feel-ing that ethe-ri-al thrill the sub-merged sav-age be-neath in his death gasp kept his ham-mer frozen there and so the bird of heav-en with archangelic shrieks and his im-pe-ri-al beak thrust up-wards and his whole cap-tive form fold-ed in the flag of Ahab went down with his ship which like Satan would not sink to hell till she had dragged a liv-ing part of heav-en along with her and hel-met-ed her-self with it Now small fowls flew scream-ing over the yet yawn-ing gulf a sul-len white surf beat again-st its steep sides then all col-lapsed and the great shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thou-sand years ago Epi-logue  AND I ONLY AM ESCAPED ALONE TO TELL THEE Job The dra-ma s done Why then here does any one step forth  Be-cause one did sur-vive the wreck It so chanced that af-ter the Parsee s dis-ap-pear-ance I was he whom the Fates or-dained to take the place of Ahab s bows-man when that bows-man as-sumed the va-cant post the same who when on the last day the three men were tossed from out of the rock-ing boat was dropped astern So float-ing on the margin of the en-su-ing scene and in full sight of it when the half-spent suc-tion of the sunk ship reached me I was then but slow-ly drawn to-wards the clos-ing vor-tex When I reached it it had sub-sid-ed to a creamy pool Round and round then and ev-er con-tract-ing to-wards the but-ton like black bub-ble at the ax-is of that slow-ly wheel-ing cir-cle like an-oth-er Ix-ion I did re-volve Till gain-ing that vi-tal cen-tre the black bub-ble up-ward burst and now lib-er-at-ed by rea-son of its cun-ning spring and ow-ing to its great buoy-an-cy ris-ing with great force the coffin life buoy shot length-wise from the sea fell over and float-ed by my side Buoyed up by that coffin for al-most one whole day and night I float-ed on a soft and dirge-like main The un-harm-ing sharks they glid-ed by as if with pad-locks on their mouths the sav-age sea hawks sailed with sheathed beaks On
